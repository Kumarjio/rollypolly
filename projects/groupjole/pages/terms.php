    </h2>
<p><?php echo TITLENAME; ?> is a social platform for people to organize or facilitate local groups that meet in person to share passions, interests, identities and activities.    </p>
<h3>All groups must fulfill the two basic requirements:    </h3>
<h4>Local Community    </h4>
<ul>
    <li><?php echo TITLENAME; ?> is for local, real life, face-to-face community building and group interactions.    </li>
    <li><?php echo TITLENAME; ?> groups and their activities must focus on face-to-face, in-person interactions that build connections among people in the <?php echo TITLENAME; ?>.    </li>
    <li><?php echo TITLENAME; ?>s must clearly facilitate community building and member to member connections.    </li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>We support <?php echo TITLENAME; ?>s that are trustworthy, honest, and respectful of their members and the community at large.    </li>

<ul>
    <li>We support <?php echo TITLENAME; ?>s that are directly affiliated with a venue as long as the venue helps facilitate the specific shared activity or passion of the group.
