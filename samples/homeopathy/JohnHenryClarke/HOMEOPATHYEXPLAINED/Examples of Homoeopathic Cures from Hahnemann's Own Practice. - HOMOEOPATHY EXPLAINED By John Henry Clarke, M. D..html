        few of Hahnemann's own cases have been published. He refrained from
        publishing many, lest his disciples should fall into routine ways and
        give certain medicine to patients with the same diseases, and not
        because he had given the same medicine to patients with the same
        diseases, and not because the medicine corresponded to the cases to be
        treated. In the second volume of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica Pura</font></i><font face="Garamond">, however, Hahnemann gives
        at "the request of some friends halting half-way on the road,"
        two cases which I will now quote just to show the way in which he went
        to work, and also to show that homœopathy is not, as some would make
        out, a mere affair of a little book and a box of pilules. Every genuine
        homœopathic prescription is made on the same plan as that followed in
        the two cases I am about to quote&nbsp;; only, the working out of the
        problem is generally done mentally, and more rapidly than a reading of
        these cases might lead one to suppose.</font></p><font face="Garamond">

        Symptoms).</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptoms 3 is met with
        in several medicines, and also in </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        (694).</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptoms 4 is
        certainly, as far as regards sickness after eating, met with in several
        other medicines (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Ignatia,
        Nux vomica, Mercurius, ferrum, Belladonna, Pulsatilla, Cantharis</font></i><font face="Garamond">),

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards symptoms 5,
        several medicines certainly cause a flow of water like water brash, just
        as well as </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        (282)&nbsp;; the others, however, do not produce symptoms similar to the
        remaining ones. Hence </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        is to be preferred to them in this particular. Empty eructation (of wind
        only) after eating (symptom 6) is found in few medicines, and in none so
        constantly, so commonly, and to such a degree, as in </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">

        symptoms in diseases (see </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        sec. 213) is the 'state of the disposition,' and as </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        (772) causes this symptom also in an exactly similar manner, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        is for all these reasons to be preferred in this case to all other
        medicines as the homœopathic remedy.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as this woman was
        very robust, and the force of the disease must consequently have been
        very considerable to prevent her, on account of pain, doing any
        work&nbsp;; and as her vital powers, as stated, were not impaired, I
        gave her one of the strongest homœopathic doses, a full drop of the
        undiluted juice of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        root, to be taken immediately, and bade her come to me again in
        forty-eight hours. I told my friend E., who was present, that within
        that time the woman would assuredly be quite cured&nbsp;; but he, going
        but half-converted to homœopathy, expressed his doubt about it. Five
        days afterwards he came again to learn the results, but the woman did
        not return then, and, in fact, never came back again. I could only allay
        the importance of my friend by telling him her name and that of the
        village where she lived, about a mile and a half off, and advising him
        to seek her out and ascertain for himself how she was. This he did, and
        her answer was' What was the use of my going back&nbsp;? The very next
        day I was quite well, and could again go to my washing&nbsp;; and the
        day following was quite well as I am still. I am extremely obliged to
        the doctor, but the like of us have no time to leave off our work&nbsp;;
        and for three weeks previously my illness prevented me earning anything.</font></p>
