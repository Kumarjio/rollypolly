        much for Hahnemann himself, and how he came to discover and develop the
        homœopathic method of studying drugs for the sick. It may serve to give
        an idea of the state of medical practice<b> </b>as Hahnemann found it,
        and at the same time to illustrate the courage and independence of the
        man, if I refer to two pieces of public criticism written in the early
        part of his career.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one thing Hahnemann
        was blamed for by his contemporaries more than anything else was his
        neglect of blood-letting. "Seignare, purgare, clysterium
        donare" was the rule in Hahnemann's time and "fool,"
        'criminal," "murderer," were the epithets applied to
        Hahnemann for his departure from the prevailing custom. "Without
        shedding of blood," as it has been put, "there was no
        salvation" for patients in those days. However, that did not
        prevent Hahnemann from speaking his mind.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Emperor Leopold II.
        Died after repeated blood-letting on the 1st of March, 1792. Commenting
        on the case, Hahnemann said&nbsp;: "His physician, Lagusius,
        observed high fever and swelling of the abdomen early on February
        28th&nbsp;; he combined the malady by venesection, and as this produced
        no amelioration.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">How could he order a third&nbsp;; and good
        heavens&nbsp;! how a fourth, when there had been no amelioration after
        the preceding ones&nbsp;? How could he tap the vital fluid four times in
        twenty four hours, always without relief, from a debilitated man who had
        been worn out by anxiety of mind and long-continued diarrhœa&nbsp;?
        Science is aghast&nbsp;!"</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another custom of the
        time (which has not by any means yet died out ) against which Hahnemann
        ran atilt was the prescribing of a variety of drugs in the same mixture.
        It was done quite artistically. There was a "base" (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">basis</font></i><font face="Garamond">),
        a "receiver" (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">excipiens</font></i><font face="Garamond">),
        a "corrective" (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">corrigens</font></i><font face="Garamond">),
        a "helper" (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">adjuvans</font></i><font face="Garamond">),
        a "director" (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">dirigens</font></i><font face="Garamond">),
        and more besides, in every prescription, and the larger it was, the more
        the prescriber was thought of - by the apothecary, at any rate, if not
        by the patient who had to swallow the dose.</font></p><font face="Garamond">

Some Old-School Appreciations of Hahnemann. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/dudgeo02.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="168" height="337">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hufeland,"
        writes Dr. Dudgeon, "who knew Hahnemann intimately, repeatedly
        expresses his high opinion of his talents. Already in 1800 (it will be
        remembered that Hahnemann's first essay on the homœopathic principle
        appeared in 1796), Hufeland writes&nbsp;: 'This principle enunciated by
        Hahnemann, may doubtless serve to guide us to the discovery of useful
        remedies.' Writing of homœopathy in 1826 he says&nbsp;: 'The subject
        becomes all the more important if the originator is a man who commands
        our respect&nbsp;; and no one will be able to deny that this is the case
        with Hahnemann, and least of all one who is in the position of the
        author of this essay, whose acquaintance with Hahnemann is of long
        standing, and who&nbsp;; connected with him for more than thirty years
        by ties both of friendship and of letters, valued him always as one of
        our most distinguished, intelligent, and original physicians.' Four
        years later he writes&nbsp;: 'Added to this was the respect I had long
        felt for the author, which was inspired by his earlier writings, and the
        important services he had rendered to medicine. I had subsequently the
        opportunity of observing many instances of good results from the use of
        homœopathic medicines, which necessarily drew my attention to this
        subject, and convinced me that it ought not to be contemptuously pushed
        on one side, but deserves careful investigation it is necessary to
        remind my readers that medicine has to thank Hahnemann for the discovery
        of the wine-test and of the soluble mercury, which is, in my opinion,
        still the most efficacious preparation of mercury, as well as far so
        much else. He has given sufficient proof in many of his earlier writings
        of a grand philosophical acumen and of a rate power of
        observation.'"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sir John Forbes,
        in his celebrated critique of homœopathy, says the Hahnemann (1846)&nbsp;:-
        'No careful observer of his actions or candid reader of his writings can
        hesitate for a moment to admit that he was a very extraordinary man, one
        whose name will descend to posterity as the exclusive excogitator and
        founder of an original system of medicine, as ingenious as many that
        preceded it, and destined, probably, to be the remote, if not the
        immediate, cause of more important fundamental changes in the practice
        of the healing art than have resulted from any promulgated since the
        days of Galen himself. Hahnemann was undoubtedly a man of genius and a
        scholar, a man of indefatigable industry, of undaunted energy. In the
        history of medicine his name will appear in the same list with those of
        the greatest systematists and theorists, surpassed by few in the
        originality and ingenuity of his views, superior to most in having
        substantiated and carried out his doctrines into actual and most
        extensive practice. By most medical men it was taken for granted that
        the system is not only visionary in itself, but was the result of a mere
        fanciful hypothesis, disconnected with facts of any kind, and supported
        by no processes of ratiocination or logical inference&nbsp;; while its
        author and his apostles and successors were looked upon either as
        visionaries or quacks, or bot. And yet nothing can be farther from the
        truth. Whoever examines the homœopathic doctrines as enounced and
        expounded in the original writings of Hahnemann and of many of his
        followers, must admit, not only that the system is an ingenious one, but
        that it professes to be based on a most formidable array of facts and
        experiments, and that these are woven into a complete code of doctrine
        with singular dexterity and much apparent fairness. Many among his
        followers are sincere, honest, and learned men.'"</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"' It is
        interesting to remember,' says Dudgeon, 'that these merely polite and
        candid statements respecting homœopathy and its practitioners proved
        fatal to the quarterly periodical which Forbes had conducted with
        eminent ability for more than twelve years. His subscribes would have
        nothing to do with a periodical which treated homœopathy with a
        semblance of fair play, and which admitted that its practitioners might
        be sincere, honest, and learned men&nbsp;; and so far lack of support
        the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Medical Review</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        after lingering for another year, was compelled to terminate its useful
        and honourable career.'"</font></p><font face="Garamond">

        Liston, the eminent surgeon, in a lecture reported in the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Lancet</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        after detailing the particulars of the cure of cases of erysipelas which
        he had treated with homœopathic remedies, says&nbsp;: 'Of course we
        cannot pretend to say positively in what way this effect is produced,
        but it seems almost to act by magic&nbsp;; however, so long as we
        benefit our patients by the treatment we purse, we have no right to
        condemn the principles upon which this treatment is recommended and
        pursued. You know that this medicine, belladonna, is recommended by homœopathists
        in erysipelas, because it produces on the skin a fiery eruption or
        efflorescence, accompanied by inflammatory fever. I believe in the
        homœopathic doctrines to a certain extent, but I cannot as yet, from
        inexperience on the subject, go the length its advocates would wish in
        so far as regards the very minute doses of some of their medicines. The
        medicines in the above cases were certainly given in much smaller doses
        than have hitherto even been prescribed. The beneficial effects, as you
        witnessed, are unquestionable. I have, however, seen similar good
        effects of belladonna, prepared according to the homœopathic
        pharmacopœia, in a case of very severe erysipelas of the head and face,
        under the care of my friend Dr. Quin. The inflammatory symptoms and
        local signs disappeared with very great rapidity. Without adopting the
        theory of this medical sect, you ought not to reject its doctrines
        without close examination and inquiry.'"</font></p><font face="Garamond">
