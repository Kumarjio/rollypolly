        "chronic disease" Hahnemann did not mean exactly the same
        thing as is now generally understood by the phrase - a disease that
        lasts a long time and is incurable. To make his meaning clear, I can not
        do better than quote Hahnemann's own definition of acute and chronic
        diseases, from paragraph 72 of his </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;:-</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The diseases to
        which is liable are either rapid morbid processes of the abnormally
        deranged vital force, which have a tendency to finish their course more
        or less quickly, but always in a moderate time - these are termed </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">acute</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        diseases&nbsp;; or they are diseases of such a character that, with
        small, often imperceptible beginnings, dynamically derange the living
        organism, each in its own peculiar manner, and cause it to deviate from
        the healthy condition in such a way that the automatic life energy,
        called vital force, whose office it is preserve the health, only opposes
        to them at the commencement and during their progress, imperfect,
        unsuitable, useless resistance, but must helplessly suffer (them to
        spread and ) itself to be more and more abnormally deranged, until at
        length the organism is destroyed&nbsp;; these are termed </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">chronic</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        diseases. They are caused by infection from a chronic miasm."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By "miasm"
        Hahnemann means an infectious principle, which, when taken into the
        organism, may set up a specific disease. According to Hahnemann, there
        were not only miasms of acute disease, like the infectious principle of
        scarlatina, for example, but also of chronic diseases. Among the latter
        he recognised three-syphilis, sycosis and psora. The first is the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">lues
        venerea</font></i><font face="Garamond">, which is recognised by all
        schools alike. The second is allied to this, but is distinguished by the
        production of characteristic warty growths. The third is a discovery of
        Hahnemann's, about which there has been the greatest misconception.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./Hahnemann's Doctrine of the Chronic Miasms. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hahnem60.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="222" height="278">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
        giving an account of what Hahnemann meant by "psora," I will
        give a familiar instance of a chronic miasm - the disease set up by
        vaccination. Vaccinia or "Cow-pox," as the late Dr. Matthews
        Duncan pointed out, is extremely analogous to syphilis in many of its
        characters, and not the least in the appearance of secondary disorders
        after the primary illness is over. The course of the disease is well
        known. The virus having been introduced through an abrasion of the skin,
        in about a week inflammation occurs at the spot. Then there appears
        first a vesicle, then a pustule, then a scab, and finally a scar when
        the scab drops off. During the time that this series of events is
        occurring, constitutional symptoms manifest themselves, chiefly in the
        form of fever and undefined malaise. When the healing has taken place,
        three may be nothing more occur. The organism may have reacted perfectly
        and discharged the miasm. But this is not often the case. The diminished
        susceptibility to small-pox infection shows a change of a deep
        constitutional character. This constitutional change has been named
        "vaccinosis" by Burnett, and, as I can attest, is the parent
        of much chronic illness. Often skin eruptions occur, lasting for years,
        or various other kinds of ill-health, lasting, it may be, as long as
        life lasts, and not seldom shortening life. When such a series of
        disorders occurs, it is not (according to Hahnemann's doctrine, though
        he did not use this illustration) a succession of new diseases, but
        different evolutions of one and the same disease, the "miasm"
        of Vaccinia producing the chronic malady, vaccinosis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the early years of
        his homœopathic practice Hahnemann noticed that in certain cases the
        remedies he gave only produced temporary benefit. In these cases he
        found that the homœopathically of the remedies given was not complete.
        There was some factor in the case which had not been matched. It became
        apparent to him, then, that he had not only to take account of the
        malady from also of previous and apparently different maladies. And he
        found the remedies which corresponded, in their action, to the whole
        course of the pathological life of a patient were needed for a cure&nbsp;;
        and through his provings he discovered what these deeply acting remedies
        were.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many cases he met with
        in practice in which the ill-health dated from the suppression of a skin
        disease, probably years before. That skin disease, said Hahnemann, is
        really a part of the present disorder. To take a common example, asthma
        is often found to appear after the "cure" by external means of
        a skin disorder. The patient is not suffering from two diseases&nbsp;:
        there is, according to Hahnemann's pathology, one </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">chronic
        miasm</font></i><font face="Garamond"> at work producing the two
        effects.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The large majority of
        chronic diseases Hahnemann traced to the chronic miasm he termed
        "psora," and he maintained on the skin of the miasm was an
        eruption of itching vesicles, of which the itch vesicle was a type. It
        has of which the itch vesicle was a type. It has been started that
        Hahnemann ascribed to the itch the production of nine-tenths of chronic
        diseases, and he has been accused of ignorance in not knowing that itch
        was caused by an insect. But Hahnemann not only knew of the itch-insect,
        he actually figured it in one of his works. But he maintained that, in
        spite of the presence of the insect, this was not the whole of the
        disease - just as the tubercle bacillus is not the whole of pulmonary
        consumption. If it were, no doctors would escape consumption, since they
        inhale the bacillus constantly from their patients. "The
        itch," Hahnemann maintained, "is chiefly an internal disease'.
        'Psora is an internal disease – a sort of internal itch – an may
        exist with or without an eruption upon the skin.' 'Psora forms the basis
        of the itch.' To the reckless suppression of the chief external symptoms
        of psora Hahnemann ascribed the prevalence of chronic disorders.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To put it in other
        words, the psora doctrine of Hahnemann is practically the same as the
        doctrine of certain French authorities who ascribe a great variety of
        chronic diseases to what they call a 'herpetic diathesis', that is to
        say, a morbid state of the organism liable to manifest itself on the
        skin by an itching vesicular eruption.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The essential truth of
        Hahnemann’s doctrine may be seen by taking a glance at the history of
        individuals and families. The skin eruptions of childhood, the late
        development of bones and teeth, the anaemia of puberty, and the
        consumption which finally carries off the patient, are not so many
        different diseases, but different manifestations of one and the same
        disease, whether we call it 'psora' with Hahnemann, or 'herpetic
        diathesis' with the French. Then, again, take a family&nbsp;: one member
        has enlarged and inflamed glands, one ulceration of the eyes, one a
        chronic cough, one hysteria, one eczema. They are all children of the
        same parents, with the same elements of heredity, and their diseases are
        essentially one and the same, only manifesting itself differently in
        different individuals. This disease Hahnemann called a 'chronic miasm'.
        The seat of its operations is the vital force, which can only be freed
        from it by dynamically acting homœopathic remedies.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his study of the
        chronic miasms Hahnemann found many other very characteristic symptoms
        besides the occurrence of eruptions on the skin; and he found remedies
        having corresponding symptoms, which he gave to patients with signal
        success. Among those remedies which he found to produce symptoms likest
        to those occurring in psoric </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">patients</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        Sulphur takes the foremost place.</font></p>
        <font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann's great works
        on </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Chronic Diseases</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        gives the symptoms of these remedies at length. This work, of which the
        full title is "The Chronic Diseases&nbsp;: their Specific Nature
        and Homœopathic Treatment," is the crowning work of Hahnemann's
        career.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen from
        the above sketch that Hahnemann's theory of disease is profoundly
        philosophical and intensity practical. It is as far as possible removed
        from tentative and fragmentary theories of disease current in his own
        and in our day. Hahnemann's pathology goes hand in hand with treatment,
        and is thus checked at every step by the test of practice.</p>
