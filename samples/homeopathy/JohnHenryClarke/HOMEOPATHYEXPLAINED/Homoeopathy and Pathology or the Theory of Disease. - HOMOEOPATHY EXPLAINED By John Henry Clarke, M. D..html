D._files/quinf04.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="238" height="299">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homœopathy
        is a science and an art of comparisons.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All we really know of
        any disease is the sum total of the manifestations - symptoms and tissue
        changes it has produced in patients. Symptoms are the language of
        disease. Nobody has ever seen "anæmia," "measles,"
        "scarlatina," or a "headache," stalking abroad as a
        separate entity. Symptoms are the language in which the disturbing
        forces, which we know as diseases, speak to us.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the same way, all we
        really know of the powers of any drug over the human organism, is the
        sum-total of the symptoms and alternations it has caused when introduced
        into a healthy organism, and the symptoms and morbid changes it has
        removed when given to the sick. Symptoms are the natural language of
        drug forces, in exactly the same way as they are of disease forces.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any case of disease,
        the problem before the Homœopathic doctor is to find the drug which has
        caused symptoms similar to those of his case. It is not necessary for
        him to find an exact comparison in </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">every</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        detail, but the most characteristic symptoms of the case must be matched
        in the symptoms of the remedy chosen, or else a cure cannot be looked
        for.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homœopathy theorises
        about nothing. In its </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond"> it admits no theories - no
        explanations of actions - but only the facts. The business of the
        homœopathic </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond"> is to present the symptoms and
        bodily alterations which each drug has actually caused. Homœopathy
        also, whilst accepting the proved facts of pathology (the science of
        disease), discards all merely pathological theories as useless for drug
        selection. Hahnemann has been severely criticised for discarding
        pathology. It is very much to his credit that he did not accept the
        pathology of his day&nbsp;; but neither he nor his followers neglect
        anything which can help to throw light on the nature of disease. As a
        matter of fact, several of Hahnemann's most distinguished followers were
        professors of pathology, including Arnold of Zurich, Rapp of Tübingen,
        d'Amador of Montpelier, Rapp of Zlatarovich of Vienna, and Henderson of
        Edinburgh. A true appreciation of the essential pathology of a case is
        often of vital importance in selecting the remedy. But it very
        frequently happens that the symptoms which decide the choice of a drug
        are of little significance from the standpoint of the pathology of the
        schools, as in the instance of the differential indications of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        above mentioned.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a common saying
        among teachers of medicine, "First diagnose your case, and then
        treat it." This may be all very well when the case is one of a
        recognised and well-defined malady, the pathology of which is clearly
        understood. But a vast number of cases are not such.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A short time age a
        picture appeared in one of the comic papers, showing two adjoining rooms
        in section - in one a patient, and in the other two doctors who had just
        been examining him and had retired to consult over his case. The
        patient, wishing to get an unbiased view of his state, had left his bed,
        and was shown with his ear at the keyhole of the door in the party
        wall&nbsp;; and this is what he heard&nbsp;:-</p>
        </font><blockquote><font face="Garamond">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img src="./Homoeopathy and Pathology or the Theory of Disease. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hippo01.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="209" height="276" alt="HIPPOCRATE">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        hope I shall not be accused of telling tales out of school when I say
        that there is many a case that is not cleared up, even at the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">post-mortem</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        What is to be done in cases such as these to avoid the
        catastrophe&nbsp;? It is here that Homœopathy is of such enormous
        advantage in knowing the value of symptoms. Symptoms are the natural
        language of disease, and in any case the sum-total of altered sensations
        and appearances gives solid ground on which the Homœopath can work.
        Reading the symptoms he can find the remedy, and many a case has been
        cured without having received a satisfactory name. The signs and
        symptoms give an organic life&nbsp;; and if we match that picture with a
        like symptom-picture from a drug proving, and give the corresponding
        drug, the symptoms will be removed and the patient cured. If we had to
        wait until pathology had settled what is the true nature of all diseases
        before we cured our patients afflicted with them, we might all retire
        from practice at once without being much missed in the world. The </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Lancet</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        one remarked, " Our knowledge of the true pathology of most
        diseases is still indefinite." [</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Lancet</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        Dec. 30, 1893? p. 1624.] This is quite true&nbsp;; but still we go on
        treating our cases all the same&nbsp;; and taking Hahnemann for our
        guide, we are on solid ground. Pathological theories are bound to change
        with every fresh addition to our knowledge&nbsp;; but disease
        manifestations remain the same from the days of Hippocrates till the
        present.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a matter of no
        little importance to grasp the idea Hahnemann formed of the essential
        nature of disease. With him, disease was not primarily a change of
        structure of function, but an alteration of the invisible vital force
        which animates the whole organism. The nature of this invisible change
        is outwardly pictured in the bodily changes and sufferings
        produced&nbsp;; and thus, according to his view, it is necessary to
        observe accurately all the symptoms occurring, in order to get a true
        picture of the vital disturbance in any case. Symptoms are the language
        of the disturbed vital force, and hence symptoms are the guide to
        treatment.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="./Homoeopathy and Pathology or the Theory of Disease. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/shakespeare.jpg" alt="Shakespeare" align="right" hspace="5" width="209" height="243">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Superficial
        critics often accuse Homœopathy of treating only symptoms. Nothing
        could be further from the truth. Homœopathy attaches importance to
        symptoms as revealing the real state of the patient&nbsp;; but it no
        more regards them as mere symptoms, than readers of Shakespeare's works
        look upon them as composed of mere words. In both cases they have a
        meaning in them, and are of significance only so far as that meaning is
        revealed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Hahnemann's day
        diseases were looked upon as something material to be got rid of by
        bleeding, purging, vomiting, salivation, sweating, issues, or in some
        such way, just as they are now looked upon as consisting principally of
        microbes to be killed. Hahnemann perceived that they are nothing of the
        kind&nbsp;; that the critical discharges which frequently occur in
        disease are not the cause of the disease, nor the disease itself, but
        simply manifestations of the working of the vital force. A fit of anger
        in a nursing woman will so change the quality of her milk, that if she
        nurses her child just after it, the child will be poisoned. But the
        poisonous milk is not the cause of the changed milk the disorder from
        which she is suffering. The invisible, intangible emotion has so
        disturbed her invisible, intangible vital force that physical changes in
        her tissues and secretions have resulted. The changes in her secretions
        are symptoms of the inward change. So the causes of most diseases
        (excluding mechanical injuries) are of an invisible, intangible
        nature---"dynamic" or "spirit like", as Hahnemann
        called it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The outward symptoms,
        which reveal the nature of the inward change in the vital force, only
        declare themselves after the "dynamic" disturbance has been
        some time in operation. In any case of disease we can estimate the
        nature and gravity of the vital disturbance only by a careful survey of
        the symptoms and signs in the patient&nbsp;; so that, for practical
        purposes, the "totality of the symptoms" constitutes what we
        have to deal with, and the only way to get rid of the symptoms is to
        restore the vital force to its normal condition.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, as Hahnemann
        pointed out, drugs are capable of producing artificial disease&nbsp;;
        and, as his experience and experiments showed, they do it by virtue, not
        so much of their brute poisonous force, so to speak, as of their
        "dynamic" powers. They act on the vital force, producing
        disturbances peculiar to themselves which reveal their presence. It
        cannot be simply and solely by absorption and distribution through the
        circulation that remedies act, for in that case their action would
        manifest itself with all drugs in the same period of time. This we know
        does not occur. Pure prussic acid acts with lightning-like rapidity,
        before it has time to be absorbed and distributed through the blood
        vessels. Some other drugs do not show some of their action until many
        days after they have been taken.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall deal presently
        with the whole question of the infinitesimal dose, and show how
        Hahnemann came to discover its power&nbsp;; but I may say here that this
        discovery was subsequent to his discovery of the Homœopathic principle.
        He did not discover Homœopathy from any preconceived notion of the
        nature of disease&nbsp;; but his views of disease were the outcome of
        his observation of the action of drugs on proverb and patients.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No account of
        Hahnemann's pathology would be complete without a mention of his
        doctrine of chronic diseases, but this I must deal with in a separate
        chapter.</p>
