        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./Homoeopathy, Allopathy & Enantiopathy   Three Ways of Utilising Drug Action. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hahnem126.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="180" height="251">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why
        the allopathic section of the profession should be so wrathful with
        Hahnemann is not a little surprising. For not only did Hahnemann
        discover homœopathy, he discovered allopathy as well. Allopathy existed
        before his time, just as homœopathy did in a way, but it was
        unconscious of its own existence. The profession had been practising
        allopathy all its life - as M. Jourdain had been talking prose - without
        knowing it. It was Hahnemann who gave it its name&nbsp;; and if he is
        the father of homœopathy he is at least the godfather of allopathy as
        well, and on that account deserves to have his bust in the medical
        school of both sections.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann pointed out
        there were three principal ways of using drugs - the homœopathic, the
        allopathic, and the antipathic or enantiopathic. The homœopathic is the
        like - to - like method, in which a medicine is given to a sick person
        because it is capable of producing similar state when given to healthy
        one - </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">similia similibus</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        The allopathic method is that in which the drug given, being
        "without any pathological relation to what is naturally diseased in
        the body, attacks the part most exempt from the disease." The
        enantiopathic is the opposite of the homœopathic, and is the treatment
        by contraries. This treatment is palliative merely. When a large dose of
        opium is given to overcome sleeplessness&nbsp;; or when an astringent is
        given to arrest diarrhœa, or a purgative is given to remove
        constipation - these are examples of antipathic treatment. But many
        diseases, such as inflammation, for example have no
        "opposites" except health, and these can not be treated by
        this method, and must be treated, if at all, in one of the other two
        ways.</font></p><font face="Garamond">

D._files/remedes9.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="199" height="369">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
        an emetic is given to relieve a cold on the chest, an action is produced
        different in place and kind from the condition treated, and this is
        allopathic. Again, when a patient treats himself for headache by taking
        an aperient, he practises allopathy&nbsp;; and again, when a medical man
        puts a blister behind a patient's ear to cure inflammation of his eye,
        the treatment is allopathic. When on the other hand, in a case of
        headache we give a drug like </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        or </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Glonoin</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        (nitro-glycerine), both of which produce produce a variety of headaches
        of great intensity when taken by the healthy, then we are practising homœopathy.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the
        majority of the medical profession scorn the idea of there being any </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">rule</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        to guide them in practice, and for this reason, I suppose, on the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">lucus
        a non lucendo</font></i><font face="Garamond"> principle, insist on
        being called nothing else but "regular". If they did not scorn
        logic as well as rule, these practitioners would call themselves medical
        anarchists.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
