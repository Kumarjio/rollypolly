        it may not be uninteresting to readers if I state at the outset how my
        own conversion to homœopathy came about. As is usually the case, I knew
        nothing whatever about it when I took my degree, since it is rarely
        mentioned by professors in the ordinary medical schools, and then only
        to be misrepresented. After my graduation at Edinburgh, by the advice of
        the late Dr. Angus Macdonald (one of the best friends I ever had), I
        took a voyage to New Zealand in charge of emigrants. On my return,
        having fixed on Liverpool as a likely field In which to start practice,
        I asked Dr. Macdonald to introduce me to some of the leading doctors in
        that city. This he promised to do, and eventually did - I have the
        letters to this day. They were never presented. The relatives with whom
        I was staying happened to be homœopaths&nbsp;; and they suggested that
        I might do worse than go to the Homœopathic Dispensary in Hardman
        Street and see what was being done there. As the letters came not, by
        way of utilizing my time I went. Like Cæsar, I not only
        "went", but I "saw"&nbsp;; but here the parallel
        ended - I did not conquer&nbsp;; homœopathy conquered me.</p>

        may say that at this period, having absorbed over 80 per cent. (if marks
        go for anything) of the drug-lore Sir Robert Christison had to impart,
        and having had sufficient opportunity for testing its value in practice,
        I had come pretty near the conclusion Oliver Wendell Holmes arrived at
        and put so neatly in his well-known saying&nbsp;: -"If all drugs
        were cast into the sea, it would be so much the better for man and so
        much the worse for the fish." I believed than (and the belief has
        become rather fashionable since) that the chief function of a medical
        man was to find out what was the matter with people - if he could&nbsp;;
        and supply them with common sense - id he happened to possess any. His
        duty was to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">treat</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        people&nbsp;; to cure them was out of the question&nbsp;; and it would
        be the better for his honesty if he made no pretence to it.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After a few weeks'
        observation at the Liverpool Homœopathic Dispensary, a case was
        presented to me in private. A small boy of five, a relative of my own,
        was brought to me by his mother. Two years before, he had been badly
        scratched on the forehead by a cat, and when the scratches healed, a
        crop of warts appeared on the site of them. And there they remained up
        to that time in spite of diligent treatment by the family doctor&nbsp;;
        As an allopath to homœopathy to see if that could help me. I consulted
        the authorities, and found that the principal drug which is credited
        with producing crops of warts is Thuja occidentalis. I ordered this,
        more by way of experiment than expecting much result&nbsp;; but I said,
        if there was truth in homœopathy, it ought to cure. In a few days
        improvement was manifest&nbsp;; in three weeks the warts were all gone.
        Rightly or wrongly I attributed, and still attribute, the result to
        Thuja, though it will no doubt be said that "charms" have done
        the same thing. Very well&nbsp;; it any one will give me a system of
        charms that I can use with precision and produce with it such definite
        effects, and better, I shall be very glad to try it. As it was, I
        concluded that if homœopathy could give me results like that,
        homœopathy was the system for me. And with all due modesty be it
        spoken, homœopathy has been doing this kind of work for me ever since -
        for a period, that is, of some thirty years. Now I will leave personal
        matters and go on to my subject proper.</p>
