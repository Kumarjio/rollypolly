        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./How to practise homoeopathy. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hahnem160.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="142" height="250">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
        is no need for any one to depend on Hahnemann, or any one else, in the
        practice of homœopathy. If he does not trust Hahnemann's provings,
        Hahnemann has taught him how to make provings for himself. Hahnemann's
        crowning virtue is that he has brought us into immediate contact with
        Nature's force, stripped from all artificial academic veils. The Law of
        Similars is ready to serve any one who wishes to make use of it.
        Hahnemann could no more take out a patent on his law than Newton could
        on the Law of Gravity.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not the place
        in which to describe in detail a complete system of homœopathic
        practice. Larger works must be consulted by medical students and
        practitioners, and the various domestic works by the laity. But I can
        give my readers one little bit of practice which most of them will be
        able to test sooner or later.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In homœopathy we have,
        as I have shown over and over again, no specifies for diseases. At the
        same time there are some remedies which cover such a large number of
        cases of a given disease that they may be regarded as quasi-specifics.
        Now we most of us know something of the properties of the common onion.
        It is the recognised agent for procuring artificial tears and an
        artificial cold in the head-sneezing, nose-blowing, and the rest. Should
        any of my readers not be content to accept this as a genuine effect of
        the onion, let them procure from a homœopathic chemist the tincture of
        onion (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Allium cepa</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        <i>Ø</i>) and take a teaspoonful of that in a little water two or three
        times a day. They will find that this will produce the same effect, only
        more marked, and a great many other effects besides. They will probably
        also find that the cold produced by </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Allium
        cepa</font></i><font face="Garamond"> has this peculiarity, that the
        nose-blowing and cough is better out of doors and worse in a warm room.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the suggestion I am
        going to make is that any one who wishes to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">know
        by experience</font></i><font face="Garamond"> whether or not homœopathy
        is a true law of Nature, should procure from homœopathic chemist of
        repute a bottle of discs, or pilules, medicated with tincture of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Allium
        cepa</font></i><font face="Garamond"> 12, and the next time they take a
        cold let them take a cold let them take a dose every hour and see what
        happens. I do not promise that it will cure </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">every</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        cold, but it will cure a large number&nbsp;; and if the characteristic </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">condition</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        "worse in a room, better in the open air," is present, it can
        hardly fail to cure the cold in a remarkably short space of time.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who are content
        to take the provings as they stand may save themselves the trouble of
        re-proving the materia medica and use the remedies on the indications
        given. In homœopathic nurseries, castor oil, Gregory's powder and
        brimstone and treacle are unknown. </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Nux
        vomica, Sulphur</font></i><font face="Garamond">, and a few other
        remedies, in tasteless preparations, are equal to all the common wants.
        The deadliest poisons under homœopathic manipulation become household
        friends. Take, for example, the deadly </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i><font face="Garamond">.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the greatest
        crimes Hahnemann was supposed by his contemporaries to have committed
        was his neglect of blood-letting. In </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        Hahnemann found the agent which enabled him to meet the conditions for
        which blood-letting was most in request. In proving </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        Hahnemann noticed it produced the chill, anxiety, fear, and irritable
        restlessness which characterise the first stage of fevers and
        inflammatory states. And experience proved that </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        in homœopathic form, was a most potent means of remedying these
        dangerous conditions at the outset. But </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        will not cure all fevers, and it is not to be used unless its leading
        indications are present.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention this because
        the success of homœopaths in curing states of fever with </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        has led allopaths to use the same remedy in fevers regardless of its
        finer indications. They give it in the strong tincture to "knock
        down temperatures" - a very dangerous practice, because </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        is not a thing to trifle with in these low preparations.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./How to practise homoeopathy. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hahnem158.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="120" height="160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
        most homœopathic mothers can sing its praises from what they have
        observed of its effects. There is no need for actual fever-or raised
        temperature-to be present in order to obtain its curative action. For
        simple sleeplessness, with restless tossing, it is one of the leading
        remedies&nbsp;; and here again it has often proved one of the best
        friends of the nursery.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For further practical
        details other works, as I have already said, must be consulted&nbsp;;
        but before leaving the subject, I should like to make one remark in
        reference to homœopathic remedies. Any one who wishes to test them
        should obtain them direct from some homœopathic chemist, and not from a
        general chemist or from "stores." The preparation of
        homœopathic remedies demands care and honesty on the part the chemist,
        and it is only right that these should be recognised in the only
        possible way by paying a fair price for them. He who buys homœopathic
        medicines at a stores because they are a few pence cheaper is apt to
        fare indifferently for his economy. Years ago a patient of mine
        complained to me that the medicines I prescribed did not act. I asked
        where he had had them dispensed. He referred to a certain large
        establishment at which he held a high appointment. I told him I would
        not take the trouble to prescribe for him if he ever went there again
        for his medicines. He went to a homœopathic chemist after this, and the
        result was so entirely satisfactory that he had no temptation to the
        "economical" in this direction thereafter.</p>
