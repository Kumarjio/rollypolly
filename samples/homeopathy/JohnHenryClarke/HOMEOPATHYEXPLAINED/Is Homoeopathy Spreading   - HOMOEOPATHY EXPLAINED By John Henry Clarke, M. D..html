D._files/hahnem162.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="216" height="295">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Considering
        that homœopathy (dating from the appearance of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">)
        is only ninety-five years old, and that is founder has only been dead
        little over sixty years, the extension of the system throughout the
        world does not leave very much to complain of. In essential
        characteristics the medical profession has not changed much since the
        days of Moliere. The famous saying of the men of Harvey's day- "We
        would rather be in error with Galen than think rightly with that upstart
        Harvey," sounds ridiculous in our ears, but the lineal descendants
        of these men are quite ready to say, either openly or in their hearts,
        the very same thing of Hahnemann and homœopathy at the present day.
        Considering, then, that in this comparatively short time, in the face of
        unheard-of persecutions and difficulties, homœopathy has abolished
        bleeding from general practice, has done away with wholesale
        mercurialisings, and has spread itself to every quarter of the civilised
        globe, there is certainly no room for despondency. At the present moment
        there are some 18,000 duly-qualified medical practitioners openly
        practising according to Hahnemann's method. How many more there are who
        practise homœopathy secretly, for fear of the medical scribes and
        pharisees, it is impossible to say&nbsp;; but their numbers cannot be
        small. In the free atmosphere of the United States homœopathic
        institutions have flourished amazingly. Homœopaths have their own
        fully-equipped medical schools, in perfect quality with allopathic
        institutions in the eye of the law&nbsp;; many most important Government
        hospitals and asylums are manned by homœopathic practitioners&nbsp;;
        and other homœopathic institutions are partly subsidised by the more
        important of the States.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the British Islands
        and on the Continent of Europe, the "Molierian" conditions are
        too powerful to admit of the generality of medical men looking at a
        question on its bare merits&nbsp;: they look at it in the light of the
        sentiments they have imbibed in the schools.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have any of the scribes
        and pharisees believed&nbsp;? we are sometimes asked. Not a few, we
        reply, have stepped out of the ranks, and emancipated themselves from
        the paralysing traditions of their order. Others have made a show of
        liberality, but have been driven back again into evil ways by the force
        of the uninstructed professional opinion they encountered. An amusing
        instance of this occurred some years ago. At the Annual Meeting of the
        British Medical Association held at Ryde in 1881, Mr. Barrow, the
        President of the Meeting, Dr. Bristowe, President of the Medical
        Section, and Mr. Jonathan Hutchinson, President of the Surgical Section,
        each, in his opening address, advocated the adoption, on the part of the
        Association, of a spirit of fairness towards homœopathy and
        homœopaths. Nothing more than this was suggested, yet the storm the
        suggestion aroused was such that each of the speakers was promptly
        silenced, and never ventured to refer to the subject in public again.
        The following year, at the Worcester Meeting, the Council of the
        Association reported on the incident as follows&nbsp;:-</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The question of
        homœopathy... unfortunately mooted in the addresses in medicine and
        surgery at the Annual Meeting at Ryde has occupied much time and thought
        on the part of the Committee of Council.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Immediately on
        the delivery of those addresses the idea arose in may minds that the
        views enunciated by the readers of the addresses had in some way been
        put forward [through them] by the Committee of Council itself"
        -terrible thought&nbsp;!- "and it was not until the President of
        the Council, Dr. Bristowe, and Mr. Hutchinson had severally and in the
        most public manner shown that this was not so, that the feeling was
        allayed."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I quote the above to
        show the slavish state of feeling that exists in the profession. If men
        like Dr. Bristowe and Mr. Hutchinson, at the head of the profession, are
        capable of being coerced by the ignorance and prejudice of the rank and
        file in this ignominious way, how is it likely that much liberty of
        thought and action is to be expected of medical students&nbsp;? It is
        not likely&nbsp;; and yet, in spite of the unlikeliness, many do come
        forward to recruit the rank of homœopathic practitioners. But the
        number who come is not sufficient to minister to the wants of the
        homœopathic public. Among the public, homœopathy is spreading rapidly&nbsp;;
        but as many of the converts have no doctor of their faith to minister to
        them when taken ill, they are obliged to send for an allopath to advise
        them&nbsp;; and they use their own judgement as to whether they take his
        medicines or not.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The allopathic medical
        journals are always crying out against the multiplication of quacks and
        quack remedies. They have nothing but their own stupid prejudice to
        thank for it. A stiff and starchy professionalism prevents them from
        learning how to cure their patients, and the public are not slow to find
        this out. What wonder, then, that they largely patronise the skilful and
        daring advertisers of patent nostrums&nbsp;? Homœopathic practitioners
        are very little troubled with defections of their patients to the
        pill-manufacturer&nbsp;; and if the old school would only consent to
        learn the art of curing from Hahnemann, its journals would have little
        cause to lament the success of unlicensed medicine-men.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In another way homœopathy
        is spreading - by the adoption of its remedies into the practice of
        allopathic text-books. This latter kind of "conveying" has
        been carried on wholesale by the authors of several medical works-almost
        invariably without acknowledgement of the source of their
        appropriations.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr David DYCE BROWN (1840-1910)" src="./Is Homoeopathy Spreading   - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/brownd03.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="234" height="330">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
        large number of these appropriations have been collected by Dr. Dyce
        Brown in a pamphlet published by the British homœopathic Association.
        This pamphlet is entitled "The Permeation of Present-day Medicine
        by Homœopathy."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this method of
        spreading homœopathy is of little use&nbsp;; the drugs may be
        appropriated, but unless the principle is apprehended, no real progress
        is made. This the British Homœopathic Association is well aware of, and
        has set itself the task of redeeming the situation. It aims at nothing
        less than the establishment and endowment of a permanent College of
        homœopathy in the heart of the British Empire. In the furtherance of
        this object is confidently relies on obtaining the moral and material
        support of every homœopath.</p>
