          &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I was studying painting a few
          years ago with Meissonier, whose valuable dog - which had been given
          to him by his great friend Dumas - was stuck with paralysis in its
          hind quarters&nbsp;; it had also its neck twisted.

          to death by a great 'vet.' In Paris, who attended to Meissonier's very
          valuable horses, as will be seen in the enclosed testimony. The same
          evening I was dining with him and his family, and the dog was in the
          room - a subject of much lamentation - when, in his sudden and
          animated manner, he challenged me to cure it with 'my Homœopathy'

          Meissonier with his brush in his mouth and his large palette on his
          thumb, in his earnest eagerness about everything that freshly caught
          his attention- and there was the animal running about on its four legs
          as strongly as ever.

          came in one of the great principles of Homœopathy-that every symptom
          must be taken into account-and the proper remedy at once suggested
          itself. I gave it two doses of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i><font face="Garamond">

        is not only in acute disease that Homœopathy shows its superiority to
        every other method of treatment. Chronic diseases of the most obstinate
        and intractable nature, which have resisted all the appliances of the
        old school, are often rapidly and radically cured by the remedies of the
        new school. Diseases that have been pronounced incurable and necessarily
        fatal have, as every homœopathic practitioner knows from his own
        experience, been frequently perfectly cured by the mild but potent
        remedies of homœopathy. Not only has homœopathy lessened the mortality
        of serious but not necessarily fatal diseases, it has also extended the
        boundaries of remedial medication. The limits of this tract will not
        allow us to give many proofs of this statement, but one, which is of
        historical celebrity, may be here mentioned. In January 1841, the
        celebrated Austrian Field-Marshall Count Radetsky was suffering from a
        tumour in the orbit of the right eye, which pushed the eyeball outwards
        and forwards. The tumour had been growing since the previous October.
        The Emperor, with whom the Field-Marshall was a great favourite, sent
        his staff-physician Dr. Jæger, Professor of Ophthalmology in the
        Joseph's Academy of Vienna, to Milan where the patient resided, to
        consult with Dr. Flarer, Professor of Ophthalmology in Pavia, and the
        Field-Marshal's ordinary medical attendant, Staff-Surgeon Hartung, a homœopathic
        practitioner, to make a report upon the disease, and to advise as to the
        appropriate treatment. The three consultants met on the 26th of January,
        and after careful examination, unanimously pronounced the disease to be
        of a fungous cancerous character. The two professors held it to be
        incurable by any means known to them&nbsp;; that a fatal termination was
        only a question of time&nbsp;; and as they held medicine to the
        powerless in such a case, they would offer no suggestion as to
        treatment.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img height="228" alt="Dr Christophe HARTUNG von HARTUNGER (1779-1853)" src="./More Illustrations. Meissonier's Dog. Count Radetsky. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hartung02.jpg" width="212" border="0" align="left">Dr.
        Hartung, while agreeing with the learned professor as to the
        hopelessness of a cure under ordinary treatment, thought that benefit
        might be derived from homœopathic remedies. The patient declared that
        he would have no other than homœopathic treatment. Under Dr. Hartung's
        homœopathic remedies, this formidable disease in this septuagenarian
        patient steadily declined. By the 19th of March the disease was
        perfectly cured, and no difference was observable in the two years after
        this, and was sufficiently active in mind and body to win the decisive
        battle of Novara in 1849.</p>
