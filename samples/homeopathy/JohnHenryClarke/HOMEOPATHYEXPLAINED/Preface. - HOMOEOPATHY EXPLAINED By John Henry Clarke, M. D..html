        hundred and fifty years ago there was born to a porcelain-painter of
        Meissen, in Upper Saxony, a son who was destined to revolutionise the
        world of medicine, to inaugurate a new era in medical thought. If ever
        the story of Samuel Hahnemann and his discoveries should fail to
        attract, the fault must lie with the teller and not with the story
        itself. For whether it be regarded from the human, the historic, the
        scientific, or the economic point of view, there is nothing in the
        world's history of more enthralling interest than the record of the
        patient, persistent, heroic labours of Hahnemann in his endeavour to
        bring to he light of day the Law which he knew must underlie the
        seemingly chaotic phenomena of drug-action. At the dawn of the
        nineteenth century, when Autocracy in the political world of Europe was
        tottering to its fall, Hahnemann, then in his prime, was making his
        first attacks on the power of Authority in medicine, and leading all who
        would to take their stand on the ground of Natural Fact. The battle is
        yet far from won&nbsp;; but Hahnemann had led the way into a new world
        of thought, and now all who wish to I </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">know</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        the thing that </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">is</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        are no longer obliged to accept that only which bears Authority's
        imprimatur.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this stage of
        progress there is no longer any need to treat homœopathy as a question
        of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">belief</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        It is nothing of the kind&nbsp;: it is a matter of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">science</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        - a thing which may be </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">known</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        No one has any right to claim either belief or disbelief in homœopathy
        - he must either know it&nbsp;; he must either understand it, or fail to
        understand it. To understand homœopathy is not such an easy matter as
        some think it ought to be&nbsp;; but it is not more difficult than is
        the understanding of other sciences. The object of this work is to make
        the understanding possible to all who wish to understand. To those who
        wish not to understand - and they are, unhappily, a very numerous body -
        I have nothing to say. The wish to know is all I ask of my
        readers&nbsp;; if, inspired with this wish, they fail after a careful
        reading of my book, the blame must lie with me.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When one comes to think
        of it, that drug-action should have more than one side to it would seem
        to be a matter of course. The scientific mind revolts at the notion that
        an active cause can produce identical results in opposite conditions.
        That a drug should act differently when given to a person under
        conditions of disease from what it would do in the same person when in
        health, is only what common sense would expect. And common sense next
        demand to know just exactly what that difference may be&nbsp;; The
        answer to that query is Hahnemann's life and work - the discovery of the
        Law of Cure. It would seem to the unprofessional mind a trite
        observation to make, that the business of a doctor is to cure. It seemed
        so to Hahnemann, and the first sentence of his </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        states plainly enough that the "high and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">only</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        business of the physician is to heal the sick - to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">cure</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        as it is termed." And yet we have respected teachers at this time
        of day telling their students that they may "treat" patients -
        they cannot cure them. They speak learnedly about the "decadence of
        drugs", as if Mother Earth could not produce plants and minerals of
        the proper potency in these latter days. The fault according to them
        lies with Nature - not in their hands&nbsp;! Homœopathy disposes of all
        this childish nonsense.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">is</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        an Art of cure, but it must be learned and practised with brains. Cures
        rarely take place by accident, and unless a man makes up his mind to
        master the art of curing, he will not achieve much in that line. The
        Faculty says, "You cannot </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">cure</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        patients - you can only </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">treat</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        them&nbsp;; if you pretend to cure, you are a quack." Homœopathy
        says, "You may cure if you will take the trouble to learn the art.
        Curing is the only excuse for your existence as a physician, and if you
        do not cure, you are a failure."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The object of this work
        is to put the facts of the facts of the case before the public, and
        before those members of the profession who have closed their
        intelligence at the bidding of the goddess Authority.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a long time past my
        publishers have been urging me to give them a revised edition of my
        little work entitled "Homœopathy&nbsp;: All about it."
        Hitherto pressure of other work has prevented me from complying with
        their request. Now that I have been able to give some thought and time
        to the subject, it has seemed to me desirable to recast the work,
        enlarge its scope, and adapt it to more recent requirements. Thus it has
        come about that although the former work is embodied in this volume, the
        work itself is rather a new book than a new edition, and I have
        therefore regarded it in this light and have given it a new title.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that more than ten
        years have elapsed since its predecessor appeared, there is no harm in
        telling the story of how it came to be written at all. The author was a
        member of a debating club composed of literary and professional me, and
        when his turn came to read a paper he chose Homœopathy for its subject.
        A number of medical men - some of them lecturers in medical schools -
        were members of the club, all of them being allopaths with the exception
        of the author. When the paper was read, the author had with him, as
        visitors, Dr. Pullar and the late Drs. Cooper and Dudgeon. The occasion
        was a very pleasant one&nbsp;; a lively but amicable discussion
        followed, in which the lay members freely joined. The latter, who were
        in a somewhat judicial position as between the two medical factions,
        had, curiously enough, nearly all of them, some personal experience to
        relate which told heavily on the side of homœopathy.</p>
        <p align="center"><img height="384" alt="Dr Robert Thomas COOPER (1844-1903)" src="./Preface. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/cooper02.jpg" width="225">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        <img height="383" alt="Dr Robert Ellis DUDGEON (1820-1904)" src="./Preface. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/dudgeo02.jpg" width="192" border="0"></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end of the
        debate there were no conversions announced on either side - as was quite
        to be expected. But having taken the trouble to put the paper together,
        I thought some permanent use might be made of it, and so published it,
        with additions, in book form.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within the ten
        intervening years many things have happened. The </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Homœopathic
        League</font></i><font face="Garamond"> has given place to a much larger
        and much more powerful body - the British Homœopathic Association. To
        the insight and energy of Dr. George Burford this Association owes its
        origin&nbsp;; and the cause of homœopathy in Great Britain owes it that
        a new interest is being taken in the advancement of Hahnemann's reform,
        and a new desire has sprung up, on the part of the public, to know what
        homœopathy is.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Garamond"><img height="395" alt="ROYAL LONDON HOMOEOPATHIC HOSPITAL" src="./Preface. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/rlhh12.jpg" width="510" border="0"></font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is hoped that this
        book may help to meet this appetite for knowledge, and may stimulate the
        interest which has been awakened in the forward movement. As the English
        Homœopathic Association of a former generation founded the London
        Homœopathic Hospital, the British Homœopathic Association has
        determined to provide the complement to the Hospital by establishing a
        College in London for the teaching of homœopathy. It is felt that this,
        and nothing short of this, will suffice to do justice to the cause of
        homœopathy in this country and Empire.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Homœopathic
        League has ceased to exist, it has left a permanent monument of its
        labours in the three volumes of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Homœopathic
        League Tracts</font></i><font face="Garamond">, to which frequent
        reference is made in the following pages. The great majority of these
        Tracts were written by Dr. Dudgeon, and all were edited by him. The
        quotations which I make from Hahnemann's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia Medica Pura</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        are taken from Dr. Dudgeon's translations of these works&nbsp;; and for
        this, and for so much besides, my warmest acknowledgements are due to
        him.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The likeness of
        Hahnemann which appears on the title-page of this work is taken from
        Jung's portrait, painted in 1819. Of this, in 1828, Stölzel made an
        engraving, which forms the frontispiece to one of the later editions of
        the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        From Stölzel's engraving a block has been out expressly for this work.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
