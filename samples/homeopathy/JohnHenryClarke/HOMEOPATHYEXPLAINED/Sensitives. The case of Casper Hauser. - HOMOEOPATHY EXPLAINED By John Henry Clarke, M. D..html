        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Robert Ellis DUDGEON (1820-1904)" src="./Sensitives. The case of Casper Hauser. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/dudgeo03.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="217" height="289">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
        may seem to some that the mass of symptoms contained in the Homœopathic
        Materia Medica must be due to the imaginations of the provers. That some
        may be such need not be denied. But there is always this check in
        homœopathy-the provings can be tested in practice. Attempts have been
        made to criticise the provings, and these have always ended by
        confirming his observations, and adding to, instead of detracting from,
        the body of symptoms available for use. Some experimenters have
        endeavoured to apply a more rigorous test. They have sought to apply the
        test of numbers to the provings. They have given a remedy to a number of
        different persons, and have rejected all symptoms which have not been
        manifested in more than one or tow provers. This method leaves out of
        account the existence of sensitives.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have mentioned above
        that in illness a person becomes in an exaggerated degree sensitive to
        the action of the remedy which is homœopathic to his condition. But
        there are some persons who are naturally sensitive to stimuli of all
        kinds. Hahnemann and a number of his provers were undoubtedly of this
        class, and their symptoms are of much greater value than those who
        organisms react but little to any kind of drug.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps the most
        remarkable example of extreme sensitiveness to medicines is the case of
        the mysterious and unfortunate Casper Hauser, who was found by the
        police aimlessly wandering about the streets of Nuremberg in the spring
        of 1828. Dr. Dudgeon has told his story in the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Homœopathic
        World</font></i><font face="Garamond">, of October, 1897. From this we
        learn that he was placed under the care of Professor Daumer who taught
        him to speak, and gradually elicited from him that he had hitherto lived
        in a dark, underground cellar, had been fed on black bread and water,
        and had been deprived of all intercourse with his follow-creatures. At
        first he had no more intelligence than a baby&nbsp;; but he learned
        rapidly. For a long time he was painfully affected by bright light and
        loud noises. He could distinguish colours in the dark, and felt acutely
        the slightest blow or touch. Perfumes would bring on convulsive attacks.
        For long he would not eat anything but black bread on which he had been
        reared. He was very subject on convulsive attacks, and become seriously
        ill. In his illness he was under the care of Dr. Preu's article
        -published in the eleventh volume of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Archiv
        für die homœopatische Heilkunst</font></i><font face="Garamond">- that
        Dr. Dudgeon's account is taken. Casper Hauser was sensitive in many
        ways. His vision was so acute that he could the berries on a bunch of
        elderberries at a distance of one hundred paces. He could distinguish
        colours in total darkness, and he saw best in twilight. He was
        clairvoyant, and had many premonitions. He foretold his attempted
        assassination of the 17th of October, 1829. (He was actually
        assassinated a few months later.)</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special interest to
        homœopathists in the historic case of Caspar Hauser lies in the fact
        that he exemplifies a sensitiveness to remedies which occurs in many
        persons to a degree only somewhat less exaggerated than his. And the
        reason I here refer to the case is to show that strength of dose, in the
        allopathic sense, he not necessarily anything to do with either the
        causation or the cure of conditions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An attempt is sometimes
        made to explain homœopathic action on the hypothesis that remedies
        "have opposite effects in large and small doses," and that,
        consequently, homœopathic remedies cure in small doses what they cause
        in large ones.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This argument is very
        specious on the face of it, but cases like that of Casper Hauser upset
        it entirely. For the remedies were all given to him in more or less
        infinitesimal form, and yet they produced not only curative but
        pathogenetic or disease symptoms, and it was not necessary for him even
        to take the remedy-olfaction was quite sufficient to set up their
        action. The 30th centesimal potency of Hahnemann represents one
        decillional part of the original substance. Understanding this, let us
        take one or two examples of the action of remedies on this youth. I
        quote Dr. Dudgeon's account&nbsp;:-</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Smelling at the
        30th dilution of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        caused a great number of the symptoms recorded by Hahnemann and some
        others. The voice became rough, as from catarrh. Speech was slow&nbsp;;
        gait unsteady. In the afternoon a febrile attack like that recorded in
        the pathogenesis of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        Sudden, burning eruption on the neck that declined towards evening. Face
        very red, veins of arms and hands distended. When walking in the evening
        felt as though ants crawled up his legs to the pit of the stomach, when
        he felt pressure on the chest&nbsp;; profuse sweat, pain in the limbs.
        The febrile attack lasted an hour, and ended with a violent rigor. Great
        prostration next day, pressure in the forehead. In bed, before falling
        asleep, tearing pains in joints and other parts of the body. Night-sweet
        so profuse he had to change his night-shirt. Second day, in evening,
        ringing like a bell in right ear, with headache&nbsp;; then he felt as
        if a drop fell down on the right side of the head, whereupon the ringing
        ceased but the headache increased."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the above was the
        result of one drug impact of the decillional dilution of a preparation
        of Indian ink-the dried contents of that the question of
        "large" and "small" in homœopathic drug-dosage is
        entirely relative. The "dose" of Sepia which Casper Hauser
        received was absolutely beyond the powers of chemical science to measure
        or estimate, and yet it was enough to bring out striking features of the
        </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        effects already pictured by Hahnemann in his own provings.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img border="0" src="./Sensitives. The case of Casper Hauser. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/kasperhauser.jpg" alt="Caspar Hauser" align="left" hspace="5" width="168" height="298">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now
        let us take another example. In August 1829, Casper Hauser was gaining
        flesh. He objected to becoming fat, and Dr. Preu treated him for it.
        Hahnemann had pointed out that </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        is useful in the obesity of youthful subjects. Dr. Preu gave Caspar
        Hauser an olfaction of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        30, and with this result&nbsp;: Immediately there occurred cough and
        compression of head&nbsp;; strong smell from the mouth&nbsp;; and he had
        a feeling of debility after stool. On the second day his clothes had
        already become looser. He became excoriated by walking and riding&nbsp;;
        loathing at meat&nbsp;; great falling out of hair&nbsp;; swelling of
        veins of hands, and heat of face.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here we have a remedy
        which, whilst correcting the trouble for which it was given, produces,
        in addition, it own characteristic symptoms. There was no question here
        of a large dose causing symptoms and a small dose curing symptoms, for
        one and the same dose did both.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The attempted
        assassination of October 17, 1829, interrupted the series of
        observations. The wound and the shock threw Casper back into his
        previous condition of hypersensitiveness to all external impressions,
        and it was long before he recovered from the effects. His restoration
        was chiefly effected by mesmerism, to which he was extremely
        responsive&nbsp;; and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        was also of use.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After this Casper
        Hauser passed out of the care of Professor Daumer and Dr. Preu&nbsp;;
        and a second attempt at assassination terminated the career of this
        mysterious and interesting youth.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Casper Hauser may be
        taken as a type of homœopathic sensitives, examples of which are met
        with by no means infrequently. In my own practice I have met with many
        examples of hypersensitiveness, scarcely less marked than his. Unless
        such cases are recognised for what they really are, the patients are apt
        to be put down as romancers by their medical attendants and given up in
        despair&nbsp;; whereas, once the truth is perceived, their sensitiveness
        can be utilised for their own good, and at the same time they will
        afford a fertile ground of observation to the medical man who has the
        care of them.</p>
