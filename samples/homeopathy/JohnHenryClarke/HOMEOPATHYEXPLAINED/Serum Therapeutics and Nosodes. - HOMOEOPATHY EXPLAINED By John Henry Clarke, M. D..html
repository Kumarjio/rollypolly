        can hardly escaped the notice of intelligent observers that the recently
        introduced treatment of disease by "serums" and
        "vaccines" is a species of homœopathy-of likes curing likes.
        This was, indeed, admitted by Dr. Roux, one of the discovers of the
        anti-diphtheritic serum ["There is truth in the Hahnemann method of
        curing like by like. Dr. Roux, in an interview with the Paris
        correspondent of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Daily
        News</font></i><font face="Garamond"> regarding the serum treatment of
        disease. -</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Daily News</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        October 30, 1894.]. The process by which this serum is obtained is by
        diluting by the original poison by introducing it into the blood-current
        of the horse. The blood drawn from the horse after such treatment
        corresponds to a homœopathic attenuation of the original virus. The
        method of administering the serum-by injection under the skin-is not a
        method much in favour among homœopaths&nbsp;; but the treatment is
        certainly on the like-to-like principle.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homœopaths, as I
        mentioned above in my reference to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Tuberculin</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        have recognised the possibility of making remedies from the viruses of
        diseases themselves, in the same way as they have tamed for therapeutic
        use the poisons of serpent and stings of insects. Hahnemann himself was
        the first to recognise this possibility. Only, in homœopathy, a
        disease-remedy must be used like every other remedy on the indications
        afforded by its effects. Take </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Tuberculin</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        for an example. </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Tuberculin</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        will not cure every case of tuberculosis&nbsp;; whilst, on the other
        hand, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Tuberculin</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        will cure many affections which are only remotely allied to
        tuberculosis, or which are not "nosodes," as they are called
        in homœopathic terminology, must be studied like all other remedies in
        their effects on the healthy. To this end they must be proved, and
        proved in the high potencies. This is rendered possible by the
        homœopathic method of preparing the potencies, and by the existence of
        persons sensitive to agencies in this form.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann made the
        first proving of a nosode, namely, the nosode of Psora, named </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        The symptoms elicited are strongly marked and characteristic, and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        is one of the most trusted agents in the materia medica, answering
        curatively in any case in which its leading features are prominent.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been contended
        that this is not homœopathy-cure by "likes" -but isopathy-
        cure by "identicals." Hahnemann met this objection by showing
        that the homœopathically prepared nosode is not </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">identical</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        with the original virus, but only </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">like</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        it, the process of preparation having </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">altered</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        it. "I call Psorinum," he says, "a </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">homœopathic</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        antipsoric, because, if the preparation of Psorinum did not alter its
        nature to that of a homœopathic remedy, it never could have any effect
        upon an organism tainted with the same identical virus. The psoric
        virus, by undergoing the processes of trituration and shaking, becomes
        just as much altered in its nature as gold does, the homœopathic
        preparations of which are not inert substances in the animal economy,
        but powerfully acting agents." (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Chronic
        Diseases</font></i><font face="Garamond">, vol. i., p. 196.)</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr James Compton BURNETT (1840-1901)" src="./Serum Therapeutics and Nosodes. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/burnettj03.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="207" height="278">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        value of nosodes in homœopathic practice is becoming every day more and
        more apparent. The late Dr. J. C. Burnett did not more than any other
        single observer to develop the great therapeutic powers which lie ready
        to our hands in these altered disease agents.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the first
        observations made by Hahnemann was the fact that diseases which are like
        each other are incompatible in the same patient at the same time,
        whereas two unlike diseases can be actively present together in one and
        the same patient. Like diseases, he noticed, would cure the effects of
        each other. The relation of vaccinia to small-pox is a case in
        point&nbsp;; and how the advocates of vaccination can get over this
        glaring piece of homœopathy it is difficult to see.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An instance of how one
        disease may cure an effect of another disease came under my own notice
        and may be mentioned here. A girl of about 10 or 11 had scarlatina
        whilst away in the country for her holiday. She recovered from the
        attack of the disease, but it left her with an affection of the kidneys
        resulting in passing blood with the urine. This condition persisted and
        was present when she returned to London and came under my care. It took
        a considerable time or get rid of the trouble, which was always liable
        to return from any slight cause. At last she was well enough to go back
        to school and she had not been there many days before she caught
        measles. This she had pretty severely, and at the height of it a great
        aggravation of the old hæmaturia set in. After that it never occurred
        again. The measles-poison cured the case homœopathically, first
        producing a severe aggravation. For measles can cause hæmaturia as well
        as scarlatina.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was an instance of
        a homœopathic cure by one disease of a </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">part</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of another disease. The resemblance between the two diseases is not
        close enough for the one to cure or prevent the other entirely. But
        nosodes are like other homœopathic remedies, and can be used as freely&nbsp;:
        it is not necessary for a case and a remedy to correspond at all points
        in order that therapeutic action may ensue. When some points of
        similarity exist, curative action will follow to the extent of the
        correspondence.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
