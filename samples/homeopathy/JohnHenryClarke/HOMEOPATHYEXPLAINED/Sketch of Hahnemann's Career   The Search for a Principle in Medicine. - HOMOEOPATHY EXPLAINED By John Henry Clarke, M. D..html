        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./Sketch of Hahnemann's Career   The Search for a Principle in Medicine. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hahnem13.jpg" border="0" width="196" height="235" align="left" hspace="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
        now it is time to tell something about Hahnemann himself, and how he
        came to discover this systematic method of studying the powers of drugs
        - to discover the principle in medicine which Sir Andrew Clark said does
        not even now exist.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samuel Frederick
        Christian Hahnemann was born at Meissen, in Saxony, on the 10th of April
        in the year 1755. At the age of 20 he commenced his medical studies at
        Leipzig, and earned his living by translating into German foreign
        scientific works at the same time that he pursued his studies. After two
        years at Leipzig he removed to Vienna, to gain practical knowledge in
        the great hospitals there. He took his M. D. degree at Erlangen in 1779.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann was an
        excellent linguist, being perfectly familiar with English, Italian,
        French, Greek, Latin and Arabic.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst yet a student he
        translated from English into German, among other works, Nugent's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Essay
        on Hydrophobia</font></i><font face="Garamond">, Stedman's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Physiological
        Essays</font></i><font face="Garamond">, and Ball's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Modern
        Practise of Physic</font></i><font face="Garamond">. From 1779 onwards
        he contributed to periodical literature, and in 1784, at the age of 29,
        he published his first original work, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">On
        the Treatment of Chronic Ulcers</font></i><font face="Garamond">. In
        this work he expressed pretty much the same sentiment as that I have
        quoted from Sir Andrew Clark as to the want of principle in medicine. He
        lamented "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">the
        absence of any principle for discovering the curative powers of
        medicines</font></i><font face="Garamond">." He could not deny that
        drugs has curative powers, but what he wanted was some principle to
        guide him in discovering and defining what those powers were, and the
        indications for their use. Hahnemann was a master of practical
        chemistry, and wrote much on chemical subjects. His book on </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Arsenical
        Poisoning</font></i><font face="Garamond">, published in 1786, was
        quoted as an authority by Christison in his work on </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Poisons</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        In 1787 Hahnemann discovered the best test for arsenic and other poisons
        in wine by means of acidulated sulphuretted hydrogen water, having
        pointed out the unreliable nature of the "Wurtemberg Test,"
        which had been in use up to that date. In 1788 he announced his
        discovery of a new preparation of Mercury, known to this day as
        "Hahnemann's soluble Mercury," and still retained under that
        name in the German Pharmacopœia. His intimate acquaintance with drugs
        and their modes of preparation enabled him to write his </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Apothekerlexicon</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        or Pharmaceutical Dictionary, which appeared in several volumes from
        1793 to 1799, and was for many years the standard work on that subject.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not by any means
        exclusively as the discoverer of the homœopathic system that Hahnemann
        is distinguished. He was a pioneer in many other medical reforms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Robert Ellis DUDGEON (1820-1904)" src="./Sketch of Hahnemann's Career   The Search for a Principle in Medicine. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/dudgeo03.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="214" height="286">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
        example, it was he who was the first to adopt the non-restraint system
        of treating lunatics. I will quote from Dr. Dudgeon an account of an
        historic instance of this&nbsp;:-</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1792 Hahnemann
        undertook the medical care of the celebrated Hanoverian statesman
        Klockenbring, who had already been treated in the usual barbarous manner
        of the period in an asylum of the ordinary stamp, with no benefit, but
        the contrary. Hahnemann treated this dangerous lunatic on a
        non-restraint plan, with out the use of chains or corporal punishment,
        which were in universal use at that period. His treatment was perfectly
        successful, and Klockenbring was restored to his family and friend
        perfectly cured. Hahnemann says in an account he gives of this
        case&nbsp;: - 'I never allow an insane person to be punished either by
        blows or by any other kind of corporal chastisement, because there is no
        punishment where there is no responsibility, and because these sufferers
        deserve only pity, and are always rendered worse by such rough
        treatment, and never improved.' "</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Wilhelm AMEKE (1847-1886)" src="./Sketch of Hahnemann's Career   The Search for a Principle in Medicine. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/ameke01.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="213" height="319">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After
        his cure, says Ameke, Klockenbring showed his deliver, "often with
        tears in his eyes, the marks of the blows and stripes his former keeper
        had employed to keep him in order."</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we will now go back
        again a little. After 1788 Hahnemann seems to have given practice in
        disgust. In a letter to Hufeland, the Nestor of medicine of his day (to
        whose journal - </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Hufeland's
        Journal</font></i><font face="Garamond"> - Hahnemann was a constant
        contributor), he says his withdrawal was chiefly occasioned by his
        disgust at the uncertainties of medical practise, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">owing
        to the want of any principle for the administration of drugs in disease</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        During this time he occupied himself with chemical researches and the
        translation of work in chemistry, agriculture, and medicine, from the
        English, French, and Italian.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was whilst engaged
        in translating Cullen's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond"> in 1790 that he made the
        classical observation which has proved to be to the science of drug
        study what the falling apple observed by the boy Newton has been to
        physical science. As his mind was always occupied with the search for
        some guiding principle for the selection of medicines in disease, he was
        struck with the unsatisfactory nature of Cullen's explanation of the
        action Cinchona bark in the cure of ague. That it did cure many case of
        ague Hahnemann could not deny&nbsp;; and it occurred to him that if he
        took some of the drug when quite well he might obtain some clue to an
        explanation of its curative action. He took it in considerable
        quantities, and produced in himself all the symptoms of an ordinary
        attack of intermittent fever. The account of the experiment will be
        found in a footnote to page 108 of vol. II. Of his translation of
        Cullen's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        Here Hahnemann was in possession of two related facts&nbsp;: Cinchona
        bark cured ague, and it also caused, in a sensitive, healthy person,
        symptoms indistinguishable from an attack ague.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An observation of this
        kind was not likely to remain unfruitful in a fertile brain like
        Hahnemann's. In the following year 1791, he translated Monro's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond">, and in a note he again refers
        to his experiments with Cinchona. Five years later, in 1796, being then
        41 years of age, he published in </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Hufeland's
        Journal</font></i><font face="Garamond"> his essay on a </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">New
        Principle for Discovering the Curative powers of drugs</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        In this he discusses the several ways in which drugs had formerly been
        studied and used, and then describes the "similar" method, the
        rule "likes by likes" (similia similibus) being first
        formulated in this essay thus&nbsp;:-</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every powerful
        medicinal substance produces in the human body a peculiar kind of
        disease - the more powerful the medicine the more peculiar, marked and
        violent the disease. We should imitate Nature, which sometimes cures a
        chronic disease by superseding another, and employ in the disease we
        wish to cure that medicine which is able to produce another very similar
        artificial disease, and the former will be cured, - </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">similia
        similibus</font></i><font face="Garamond">."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img alt="Dr William CULLEN (1712-1790)" src="./Sketch of Hahnemann's Career   The Search for a Principle in Medicine. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/cullen02.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="222" height="280">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
        this essay he referred to his early note on Cullen, and said after
        mature experience he could say that not only </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">probably</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        but </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">quite certainly</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        bark cured ague because it had the power to produce fever. He quotes
        examples of well known drug actions to support his proposition, and
        sketched in a masterly way the characteristic features of a number
        drugs.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1805 - Hahnemann
        being now 50 years old - appeared two works of great importance&nbsp;:
        first his </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Æsculapius in
        the balance</font></i><font face="Garamond">, which takes a general
        survey of traditional medicine and pronounces on it the verdict
        "weighed in the balances and found wanting" - a verdict which
        has since received very amble endorsement. Second, in two vols. In
        Latin, his </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Fragmenta de
        viribus medicamentorum positivis sive in sano corporate observatis</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        (Fragments on the Positive Powers of Drugs, - that is to say, their
        effects observed in the healthy body). This contained the first effort
        towards the reconstruction of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond"> on a relational basis of pure
        experiment on the human body.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1806 appeared his </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Medicine
        of Experience</font></i><font face="Garamond">, in which is contained
        the first complete exposition of the homœopathic method now thoroughly
        thought out by him after sixteen years of unremitting work -
        observation, experiment, and research. This was published in </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Hufeland's
        journal</font></i><font face="Garamond"> - that is to say, in the
        leading professional journal of his time. The same year Hahnemann
        published the last work he translated - Haller's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond">, Haller being one of Hahnemann's
        forerunners in recommending the testing of drugs on the healthy body&nbsp;;
        but Haller did nothing towards carrying his recommendation into effect.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1807 Hahnemann first
        used the word "homœopathic" in the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">title</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of a work - an article also contributed to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Hufeland's
        Journal</font></i><font face="Garamond"> - on "Indications of the
        homœopathic Employment of Medicines in Ordinary Practice."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1810 may be
        said to be the birth year of homœopathy, for in that year appeared the
        first edition of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        which is an expansion of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Medicine
        of Experience</font></i><font face="Garamond">, and a complete statement
        of the Homœopathic method. The publication of Hahnemann's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        marks an epoch in the history of therapeutics. It constitutes a
        complete, practical, and philosophical statement of the art of cure. It
        sets out clearly with the statement that the business of the physician
        is not to 'treat" but - to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">cure</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        "The physician's high and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">only</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        mission is to heal the sick- to cure, as it is termed "- this is
        the first aphorism of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        Four other editions of the work followed the first&nbsp;; the fifth
        edition appearing in 1833. The year following the first appearance of
        the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        -1811, that is,-saw the first part of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medicas Pura</font></i><font face="Garamond">, the third edition of
        which appeared in 1830.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During these years of
        independent thought and action, as may easily be imagined, Hahnemann had
        no very easy time of it with his medical brethren, whose ideas he was
        upsetting, or with the apothecaries, whose trade he bade fair to
        undermine. The latter were paid according to the number of quantities of
        the drugs in the prescriptions they dispensed, and Hahnemann insisted on
        giving only one drug at a time, and not too much of that. Consequently
        he was driven from one place to another, until in 1812, he gave up all
        hope of influencing the older man in the profession, and determined to
        proceed to Leipzig and there devote himself to teaching the pupils of
        the medical department of the University. Certain conditions had to be
        fulfilled before he could obtain permission to do this&nbsp;: he had to
        write a thesis, and defend it before the Faculty of the University, and
        pay a fee of fifty thalers. In compliance, he wrote and read his thesis
        entitled "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">The
        Helleborism of the Ancients</font></i><font face="Garamond">", and
        so amazed his auditors with his mastery of his subject his mastery of
        his subject and the immense learning and research his essay displayed,
        that the Faculty congratulated him publicly and granted him his license
        to teach forth with. Any one who wishes to read the treatise (which is
        exceedingly interesting still) will find it translated in Dr. Dudgeon's
        collection of Hahnemann's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Lesser
        Writings</font></i><font face="Garamond">. At Leipzig he continued
        lecturing twice a week, giving two courses of lectures a year until
        1821. During his time he gathered about him an enthusiastic band of
        disciples, who helped him in providing medicines, and whose names are
        now immortalised in the Homœopathic </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond"> by the experiments they made on
        themselves with different drugs. In 1819 persecution was commenced by
        the apothecaries, who took action against him for preparing his own
        medicines (which they were incompetent to prepare). The persecution was
        at last successful, and Hahnemann was driven from Leipzig in 1821 to
        find an asylum with a former patient, Duke Frederick Ferdinand of
        Anhalt, who made him his private physician, with liberty to engage in
        general practice at his capital town of Coethen.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time
        Hahnemann's fame as a practitioner had spread far and wide. The result
        was that invalids flocked to the little town of Coethen in search of his
        aid. The majority of these were affected with ailments of long standing,
        and thus it came about that Hahnemann had abundant opportunity of
        observing the symptoms and course of chronic diseases, and in amplifying
        and perfecting the homœopathic means of curing them. In Coethen there
        was comparatively little in the way of acute illness to distract him
        from this special line of work. It was during this period that
        Hahnemann's first work on </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Chronic
        Diseases</font></i><font face="Garamond"> was written and the first
        edition was published. In 1828 the first three volumes appeared, nine
        years after his arrival Coethen. The fourth volume was published 1830,
        and the fifth not till after the Coethen period, when Hahnemann had
        removed to Paris.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was not in
        Coethen that the true nature of chronic diseases had become plain to
        Hahnemann. Three years before he was driven from Leipzig the problem had
        presented itself to him&nbsp;; and the same over mastering consciousness
        of the existence of Natural Law impelled him to solve this difficulty as
        he had already solved the problem of the homœopathic relationship of
        drugs and diseases.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the "Essay on
        the Nature of Chronic Diseases," which forms the introductory part
        of his work on </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">The
        Chronic Diseases</font></i><font face="Garamond">, Hahnemann tells the
        story of its inception. "Ever since the years 1816 and 1817,"
        he writes, "I had been employed, day and night, to discover the
        reason why the homœopathic remedies which we then knew, did not effect
        a cure of the above-named chronic diseases. I tried to obtain a more
        correct, and, if possible, a completely correct idea of the true nature
        of those thousands of chronic ailments which remained uncured in spite
        of the incontrovertible truth of the homœopathic doctrine, when, behold&nbsp;!
        the Giver of all good permitted me, about that time, to solve the
        sublime problem for the benefit of mankind, after unceasing meditation,
        indefatigable research, careful observations, and the most accurate
        experiments."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a later chapter I
        deal somewhat fully with Hahnemann's doctrine of the nature of the
        chronic diseases&nbsp;; but I wish to point out here that in Coethen he
        found ample opportunities for practically testing his observations, for
        the proving of new remedies, and for perfecting the homœopathic
        armamentarium.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On March 31,1830,
        Hahnemann had the misfortune to lose his first wife, he being then near
        the completion of his seventy-fifth year. She had been the stay and
        companion of his stormy life, and had borne him eleven children, two
        sons and nine daughters.</p>

        five years after this event there came to Coethen among the number of
        those who sought the aid of the modern Æsculapius, the brilliant and
        talented Melanie d'Hervilly Gohier, As all the world knows, the
        acquaintance ended in the second marriage of Hahnemann, he then being in
        his eightieth year, and his bride being thirty five. But it was anything
        but an ill-assorted match, for all that. The second Madame Hahnemann
        perceived that her husband might fill a much large sphere of usefulness
        if he left Coethen and made his home in Paris. Thither she induced him
        to travel, and through her influence with the Government of the time she
        obtained for Hahnemann to a licence practise in the French capital. A
        student of science, an artist, and something of an anatomist as well,
        under her husband's tuition she rapidly developed no little skill in the
        practice of medicine and homœopathy. She became practically his
        assistant, as it was impossible for Hahnemann to attend to all who came
        to see him. Madame Hahnemann acted as his protector, and would not allow
        more to have access to him than he could attend to. For eight years the
        Hahnemann's led in Paris a life of great activity and unclouded
        happiness, the centre of a brilliant circle. Hahnemann's presence in
        Paris gave a great impetus to the study and practice of homœopathy, and
        the influence of his work in that city remains to this day. On Sunday,
        July 2,1843, he breathed his last. He was buried in the cemetery of
        Montmartre.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The year 1900 was
        marked by two events of great importance in connection with Hahnemann.
        After prolonged negotiations with the executors of the late Madame
        Hahnemann, permission was obtained to remove Hahnemann's body from its
        obscure position in Montmartre to a site purchased in the cemetery of
        Père Lachaise. There a monument of Scotch granite from Peterhead,
        raised by his admires from all parts of the world, and surmounted by his
        bust in bronze, was unveiled on July 21,1900, in the presence of the
        members of the International Homœopathic Congress then in session in
        Paris.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other event was the
        unveiling of the Hahnemann monument in Washington, erected at a cost of
        £70,000 by Hahnemann's followers in the United States of America. This
        monument, which is one of the finest pieces of sculptural art in the
        States, has a commanding position in the famous Scott Circle at
        Washington, and was unveiled June 21,1900, by President McKinley.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst on the subject
        of Hahnemann's statues, I may mention that Leipzig, which refused to
        Hahnemann a home in his life time accepted his statue a few years after
        his death (1851), when his friends desired to erect one in his memory.</p>
