        the course of conversation at a public dinner the subject of homœopathy
        cropped up, and my neighbour, a layman of intelligence, frankly stated
        the objections he had to the system, looked at from the outside. He
        owned that he had no personal acquaintances with homœopathy, and had
        not studied it&nbsp;; but it seemed to him that a man who did not pin
        himself to a system was more free to use any one and every means of
        benefiting a patient than one who did. Further, he thought that
        medicines which were of such an innocent nature that they could be
        safely prescribed in domestic practice, must have very little power of
        doing any good at all. I will take these two objections and discuss them
        in their order.</p>

        </em>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Garamond">This
        is a very natural view for any one not acquainted with the system to
        take. Really the very opposite is the case. Homœopathy does not fetter
        its adherents&nbsp;: it sets them free. It gives those who follow it a
        point of view from which they can discern clearly all remedial means
        that are brought forward, and judge them at their proper worth. By its
        double-sided method of studying drugs it can estimate their power and
        use them with a precision unknown to allopathy. Further, it can take
        advantage and make good use of the mistakes and over-dosing of the
        allopaths, which invariably occur with drugs newly brought out. For
        example, when chloral was first launched upon the medical world, it was
        declared to be perfectly harmless, and was given in large doses to
        numbers of patients. In some instances serve attacks of nettle-rash
        followed its use. This at once showed to homœopaths its power over skin
        disease, and it has been used by them in certain cases of nettle-rash
        ever since. Again, when salicylic acid and its salts were first given in
        cases of rheumatism, it produced in many patients who were over-dosed
        with it, deafness, noises in the ears, and vertigo. The hint was at once
        taken by homœopathists, and salicylate of soda in its homœopathic from
        has cured many patients suffering from a disease which presents this
        distressing set of symptoms, and is called after the man who first
        described it, "Meniere's disease. " I may mention also the
        drug </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Thyroidin</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        lately brought forward as a remedy for a disease called myxœdema. This
        drug (prepared from the thyroid gland of the sheep) has produced
        alarming symptoms in many patients, and in the hands of homœopaths has
        been used successfully in cases presenting similar symptoms. Homœopaths
        are free to use anything, - just as free as allopaths&nbsp;; only they
        have this advantages&nbsp;: knowing the doublesideness of drug action -
        that a drug can cure conditions like those it can produce in the healthy
        - they have a much more intimate knowledge of any drug that is brought
        forward than an allopath have. The latter has to blunder on in the dark,
        and learn from his mistakes as much as he can&nbsp;; but his mistakes
        can never teach him so much as they teach a homœopath.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, really, there is
        no comparison between the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">system</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of homœopathy and the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">no-system</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of allopathy. There are reason, light, and orderly progress in the one&nbsp;;
        there is nothing but chaotic fragments in the other. Homœopathy no more
        trammels its adherents than the laws of Nature trammel the Mechanician.</font></p><font face="Garamond">

          2. Homœopathy is too harmless to be of any use.

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff"><img border="0" src="./Some Objections Answered. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/remedes2.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="179" height="300">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Garamond">It
        is quite true that homœopathy is of no use for positioning vermin or
        for killing patients. If patients must die, it prefers that they shall
        die a natural death. It is also true that the homœopathic preparations
        of deadly poisons may be used with perfect safety in household practice.
        But it does not follow that because a preparation cannot kill, therefore
        it can not cure.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may here mention
        incidentally another objection that has been raised&nbsp;: - If homœopathy
        is true," it is said, "a drug must cure in the same dose as
        that in which it has caused the symptoms for which it is given."
        But the objector in this case leaves out of account the difference in
        the sensitiveness of the human organism under the different conditions
        of health and disease. Homœopathy simple demands that there shall be a
        correspondence between the disease symptoms and the drug symptoms. The
        rest is a matter of experience, and experience shows that in a normal
        healthy state the organism requires a larger dose of a drug to disturb
        it than it does to restore it when similarly disturbed by disease. The
        difference in the sensitiveness of an organ in health and disease may be
        seen any time. Take an inflamed eye and compare that with a normal eye
        in its reaction to light. A normal eye can bear a very strong light
        which to an inflamed eye would cause exquisite pain.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This fact supplies the
        answer to the objection to homœopathic medicines, on the score of their
        harmlessness. Remarking, by the way, that it would be well for the world
        if all drugs were equally harmless, I may add that the sensitiveness of
        the diseased human organism to the homœopathically indicated drug is
        intensified beyond conception. It is impossible to get the dose too
        small if attenuated in the graduated manner directed by Hahnemann. And
        even in certain individuals when not diseased there is a peculiar
        sensitiveness to certain drugs infinitely transcending the sensitiveness
        of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Drosera</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        to phosphate of ammonia, which gave Darwin such a fright. Some persons
        can not be in attic of a house whilst a few grains of Ipecacuanha are
        being powered in the basement without being powerfully affected thereby.
        In the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Homœopathic
        World</font></i><font face="Garamond"> of July, 1885, I quoted the
        report of a case from the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">British
        Medical Journal</font></i><font face="Garamond"> of February 7, of the
        same year, in which a medical men tells how he nearly killed a patient
        by simply applying a linseed poultice, though the patient protested that
        every time such a poultice had been applied she had an intense attack of
        asthma. The doctor pooh-poohed her statement, insisted on the poultices
        being applied to her leg (which was ulcerated), with the result that
        three hours later he was "summoned to see her, as her sister
        thought she was dying." And he continues&nbsp;: "I found her
        livid, and struggling for breath, and certainly in as bad an attack of
        asthma as I ever saw." To an allopath an observation of this kind
        is a curiosity and nothing more to a homœopath it is full of useful
        significance.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is exceptional to
        find a patient as sensitive as this remedy not homœopathically related
        to the case. But in disease, the patient becomes excessively sensitive
        to the remedy which has caused corresponding symptoms, that is to say,
        to the remedy which is homœopathic to his condition. Experience taught
        Hahnemann that a very much smaller amount of the corresponding drug was
        needed to cure then that required to produce the symptoms. Experience
        has confirmed the fact in the practise of thousands of his followers&nbsp;;
        and it now remains established beyond the possibility of disproof.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now pass on to
        answer other objections we sometimes hear.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
        </font><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff"><em>

          3. Homœopathy has no Tonics

        </em>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Garamond">On
        the contrary&nbsp;; every properly chosen homœopathic remedy is a tonic
        to the case treated. Again and again I have been asked by patients,
        "Was not tonic you gave me&nbsp;? my appetite has been so much
        better since I took it," when it was merely the appropriate homœopathic
        remedy. By "tonic," people generally understand some thing
        which increase the appetite and the feeling of strength. The appropriate
        remedy will do both&nbsp;; but this implies that the patient is in a
        state of debility. There are no such things as "tonics" in an
        absolute sense.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quinine is only
        "tonic" when given for debility&nbsp;; when taken in health it
        is one of the most debilitating drugs known. The same may be said of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Arsenic,
        Iron, Phosphorus</font></i><font face="Garamond">, and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Strychnine</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        They are only "tonic" to special kinds of debility, like those
        they are capable of creating. There is thus an inconceivable amount of
        harm done by indiscriminate indulgence in "tonic". It is a
        relic of the old barbarous treatment of names of diseases by names of
        drugs, against which Hahnemann protested. A patient is feeling
        "want of a tone&nbsp;;" what could be simpler to than to take
        a "tonic"&nbsp;? In nine cases out of ten the result is slow
        poisoning. In homœopathy we differentiate the different kinds of
        debility and prescribe the remedy which corresponds, in dose which is
        quite large enough to remove the debility without depositing a mineral
        or vegetable poison in the patient's body to breed future trouble. In
        large number of cases of debility there is one of the chronic miasms at
        the bottom of it. Relieve the system of that by the appropriate
        homœopathic remedy, and the feeling of wellness and natural appetite at
        once return without the help of strong drugs.</font></p><font face="Garamond">

        </em>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Garamond">This
        is often alleged against homœopathy as a grave defect. Homœopaths hold
        themselves free to make use of the physiological effects of any drug if
        they think the occasion calls for it, only they do not delude themselves
        with the idea that they are curing a patient of constipation by simply
        ordering a purge. Homœopaths have a much higher opinion of the unaided
        powers of nature than allopaths, lay or medical entertain. Some of the
        latter think that no natural functions can be properly carried out
        unless assisted by some drug- no meal can be digested without the aid of
        some digestive, or else some mineral water. The perpetual resort to
        aperients on the part of such vast numbers is another relic of
        barbarism, and a survival of the Faculty's teachings in the days when
        the whole of medical practice was summed up in bleeding, purging, and
        administering lavements. A young medical man, fresh from one of the
        London schools, recently told me that there was always a sigh of relief
        from the physician when examining a patient in the wards if he found
        that he had constipation, for then he knew what to describe - a
        purgative.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing that is lost
        sight of by allopaths is that constipation is a constitutional disease.
        A purgative does not cure it, but only gives temporary relief, and
        aggravates the actual condition. Homœopathy cures constipation without
        any purging. The drugs most used by the allopaths to check diarrhœa- </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium,
        Sulphur, Nux vomica, lead, Alum</font></i><font face="Garamond">, and
        many other so-called astringents-have cured in their homœopathic form
        the most inveterate cases of constipation without any disturbance
        whatever. Homœopathy has thus very best of aperients&nbsp;; and though
        it does not possess and does not want active purgatives, homœopathists
        are free to use drugs in that way if in any case they think it worth
        while as a temporary expedient. The need for that is so rare, however,
        in the practise of many homœopathists, as to be scarcely worth taking
        into account.</font></p><font face="Garamond">

        most valid argument against homœopathy was given me by a doctor in the
        navy who related a case. The ship this doctor was appointed to was
        stationed in the Red Sea during one of the Egyptian wars, and acted as
        hospital ship to the fighting force on shore. During this time many
        cases of dysentery were received on board, and as my friend found no
        satisfactory treatment for it under allopathy, and as he knew something
        about homœopathy, he determined to treat his cases according to
        Hahnemann's method. The cases all presented symptoms like those produced
        by </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Mercurius corrosivus</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        and this he gave in minute doses with the result that his patients got
        well in a very short time.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One officer-and it is
        his case that I particularly allude to-was brought on board exceedingly
        ill with dysentery&nbsp;; but to every one's astonishment he recovered
        under the treatment by </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Mercurius
        corrosivus</font></i><font face="Garamond"> so rapidly that he became
        perfectly well and ready to return to duty in a very short time. The day
        after he rejoined his regiment, the next battle of the campaign was
        fought, and he was the first man to be killed on the British side&nbsp;!
        Under allopathy he could not possibly have got well in time.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
