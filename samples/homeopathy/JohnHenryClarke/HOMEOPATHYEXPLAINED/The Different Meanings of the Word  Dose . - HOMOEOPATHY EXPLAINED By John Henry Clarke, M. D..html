        arrived at a conclusion as to what homœopathic medicines are, it is now
        essential that we should clear our minds as to what is a homœopathic
        dose, because the two schools of medicine attach very different meanings
        to the word. When an allopath used the word "dose," he means
        so many drops of measure or so many grains by weight-enough to produce
        the direct positive, or physiological effect he desires, and not enough
        to endanger the patient. To go back to the example of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        the "dose" recommended to stay the action of the bowels in a
        case of diarrhœa is from one to three grains. So much for the meaning
        of the word "dose" when used by an allopath. In common speech
        a homœopathic dose of anything means an infinitesimal dose. But that is
        not exactly the meaning attached to the word by the professional
        homœopath. If a homœopathic doctor who had prescribed </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        for a patient suffering from constipation were asked, "What does
        did you give it in&nbsp;?" he would not think of weights or
        measures at all-as the allopath would. He would reply to the query that
        he gave the mother tincture (of which the sign is </font><i><font face="Garamond">&#952;</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        or <i>Ø</i>), or the 3rd, the 6th, the 12th, or the 30th, as the case
        might have been. So we see a homœopathic "dose" means </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">the
        particular preparation of the remedy used</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        in the first place. In the second place it means simply the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">quantity
        of that preparation</font></i><font face="Garamond"> or </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">the
        form of that preparation</font></i><font face="Garamond">. For example,
        say </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        30 was given&nbsp;: it may have been given in one or two drops in the
        tincture, one or more pilules, one or more globules&nbsp;; or the drops
        may have been given pure on the tongue, or diluted in water, or mixed
        with sugar of milk. To an allopath the word "dose" naturally
        calls them all up in his mind.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img border="0" src="./The Different Meanings of the Word  Dose . - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/remedies4.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="209" height="350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
        will be seen that "quantity" has very little to do with the
        idea of "dose" in the homœopathist's mind, and it has
        everything to do with it in the allopath's. The homœopath who has
        prescribed for him </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        30 might take it every hour of the day and all his life long - he could
        never live long enough to imbibe what would represent a single grain of
        the original substance. In homœopathy "dose" means
        "impact of drug-force" rather than quantity.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And this brings us to
        another question which the homœopathic use of the word involves. The
        doctor who, as we have supposed, prescribed </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        30 for the case of constipation, might have been further asked,
        "Did you give a single dose, or did you repeat&nbsp;?" And
        until that query had been answered we should not have known exactly how
        the remedy had been given. So that the word "dose" in homœopathy
        implies not only drug-impact, the form in which the drug-impact is
        communicated, but the further question whether it is a single impact or
        a repeated one.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is necessary to make
        all these points clear if misunderstandings are to be avoided. Half the
        difficulties in the scientific world arise from different observers
        attaching different meanings to terms in common use.</p>
