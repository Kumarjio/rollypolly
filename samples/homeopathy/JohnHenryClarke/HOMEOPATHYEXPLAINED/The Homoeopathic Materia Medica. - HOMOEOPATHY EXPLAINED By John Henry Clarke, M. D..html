        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Georges Henri Dieudonné JAHR (1800-1875)" src="./The Homoeopathic Materia Medica. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/jahr01.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="254" height="343">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having
        explained "homœopathic Medicines" and "homœopathic
        Doses" it will be well now to say something about the homœopathic
        Materia Medica. Here again, it is a pity that the use of old terms
        cannot now be avoided. "Materia medica" means medical
        materials, that is to say, drugs. A work on "Materia Medica"
        is a work which tells about drugs. The allopathic "Materia
        Medica" describes the drugs used in the ordinary schools, their
        physical properties and tests. So far it is in line with the
        Homœopathic Materia Medica&nbsp;: but now comes the difference. The
        allopathic Materia Medica goes on to tell us of a drug that it is
        "narcotic, stimulant, sedative, antispasmodic,
        anæsthetic"&nbsp;; or "irritant, cathartic, diuretic,"
        or whatever it may be, and to tell the maladies it is used in and the
        quantities to be administered.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now Hahnemann pointed
        out that these terms, "stimulant," "sedative,"
        "antispasmodic," etc., were more or less question-begging
        terms, and conveyed no real information. He, therefore, proceeded to
        construct his Materia Medica, nor of adjectives, but of facts. Therefore
        it is that in opening a homœopathic Materia Medica we are confronted
        with a list of symptoms, arranged in definite order under the heading of
        each remedy described. These symptoms are the effects
        -"positive" effects, Hahnemann called them- experienced by
        Hahnemann himself and the other "provers," who tested them on
        their own healthy persons. Hahnemann called his Materia Medica a
        "pure" Materia Medica, since it was made up of the
        unadulterated effects of the remedy in question, free from the taint of
        question-begging adjectives. In order to use a drug with definite
        effect, it was necessary, as he showed, to be able to find out just what
        the drug had </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">done</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        The homœopathic Materia Medica consists of the record of these definite
        effects of drugs, observed either in provings or in poisonings.</font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Garamond"><img alt="Dr Timothy Field ALLEN (1837-1902)" src="./The Homoeopathic Materia Medica. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/allent03.jpg" border="0" width="242" height="320">&nbsp;
        <img alt="Dr Constantin HERING" src="./The Homoeopathic Materia Medica. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hering01.jpg" width="209" height="306"></font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since Hahnemann's day
        thousands of observers have been at work adding to the provings he made,
        and it has been necessary to arrange and rearrange the matter which has
        accumulated. First of the Materia Medica compilers after Hahnemann was
        George Heinrich Gottlieb Jahr. Next came Timothy field Allen, whose </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Encyclopædia
        of Pure Materia Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond">, in ten volumes,
        completed in 1879, is a permanent endowment of the homœopathic school.
        Contemporary with Allen, and earlier in the field, though his work was
        later in appearing, was Constantine Hering, whose name I place second
        only to that of Hahnemann himself in the annals of Homœopathy. Hering
        has left also ten volumes, which he has named </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">The
        Guiding Symptoms of the Materia Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        Only three of these appeared in his lifetime&nbsp;; the rest were ably
        and faithfully edited by his literary executors.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own contribution to
        this work of arrangement consists of the three volumes of my </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Dictionary
        of Practical Materia Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond"> completed
        in 1902, in which I have sought to give a somewhat new setting to the
        material gathered by my predecessors. The bald list of symptoms hitherto
        presented in homœopathic materia medicas wanted, it seemed to me a
        practical introduction of a more extended nature than had been
        heretofore attempted. Moreover, it seemed desirable to bring the entire
        number of remedies hitherto used into one uniform arrangement, so that
        they could be got at any time. This my work has effected. It has also,
        as I think, made the Homœopathic Materia Medica a more readable entity,
        and a more possible study than it had previously been. Hahnemann
        introduced many of his remedies with prefatory remarks of the greatest
        practical value, but it was no part of his plan to do this
        systematically. I have endeavoured to present in my introductions the
        clinical experiences which have accumulated since Hahnemann's time.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Symptom-lists which
        constitute the real body of the Homœopathic Materia Medica, are
        arranged, for the sake of reference under the different anatomical
        regions of the body. Thus it possible to find out under any remedy the
        exact symptoms it has produced in the head, eyes, ears, stomach, limbs
        etc.&nbsp;; so that when any case of disease arises, presenting symptoms
        in any of these regions, the medical man is able to compare his case
        with the remedies which seem to him most closely to correspond.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But for the full use of
        homœopathic Materia Medica, another kind of work is required, namely,
        the Repertory. The Repertory is an index or concordance in which all
        remedies having caused any particular symptom may be found. So that the
        prescriber who had case for which he knows no corresponding remedy may
        find one by consulting the Repertory, which will tell him which remedies
        have produced the symptoms which his case presents.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img alt="Dr James Tyler KENT (1849-1916)" src="./The Homoeopathic Materia Medica. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/kentjt08.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="226" height="282">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I
        say "the" Repertory, but there are really many repertories,
        and the building of repertories is one of the most arduous tasks that
        fall to the lot of the homœopathic writer. The most complete of
        symptom-repertories at the present date is Dr. Kent's. My own </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Clinical
        Repertory</font></i><font face="Garamond"> only deals with certain
        sections of my </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Dictionary
        of Materia Medica</font></i><font face="Garamond">, particularly
        indexing the clinical section, with which I have prefixed the account I
        have given of each of the remedies. Clinical repertories have a distinct
        place in homœopathic work&nbsp;; but the principal repertories must
        always be those which index the actual symptoms. The Materia Medica
        gives all the symptoms produced by each remedy under the heading of each
        remedy. Repertories, which are the counterpart of the Materia Medica,
        give list of symptoms, the name of all the remedies which have produced
        any given symptom being appended to it.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
