        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From what has already
        been said, many of the advantages of the new system over the old
        "no-system" will have become apparent to all. But there is one
        pervading advantage, and that is, the hopefulness of homœopathy as
        compared with allopathy. Homœopathy is a system of "cure,"
        whereas allopathy professes to do nothing more that "treat" of
        palliate. Homœopathy actually restores sick persons to health&nbsp;;
        and if they are past cure it affords the most perfect palliation that
        can be found. The hopefulness of homœopathy is an outcome of the idea
        Hahnemann formed of the nature of disease, as not being so much a gross
        material alteration of the structures and functions as a disorder of the
        vital force. Looking at disease in this light, homœopathists are not
        dismayed in the presence of tumours and changes of solid structures, as
        are the members of the old school. Homœopathists know from experience
        that a very large proportion of tumours can be acted upon by medicines,
        and that the vital process which has produced them can be reversed.
        Whilst the allopath knows no better way of dealing with morbid growths
        than by cutting them off (which, whilst it cuts off the growth, leaves
        the disease behind in the organism), homœopathists seek to get rid of
        the growth by curing the patient of the diseases state of which the
        growth is but a manifestation. In the same way homœopathists approach
        many other diseases which in allopathy are relegated to the surgeon,
        such as fistulæ of various kinds, diseases of bones, and hæmorrhoidal
        tumours. This is what I venture to call "conservative
        medicine." In days gone by the remedy for much serious affection of
        the limbs was amputation. Later improvements in surgical methods have
        shown that it is possible to save many limbs which were formerly
        condemned. This is what is called conservative surgery. But there is
        room for much improvement yet. Many operations which are now performed
        would be spared to the patient if only the conservative powers of homœopathic
        medicine were widely known.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true the ways of
        homœopathy are very gentle and unobtrusive, whilst surgical methods are
        attended with much pomp and circumstance-and expense. To cut off a
        breast for tumour, and leave a patient mutilated for life, is only the
        work of half an hour&nbsp;; to cure the patient of her diseased state,
        and leave her sound and healthy, may be the work of months or years.
        Many patients, who fancy the tumour is the whole of their disease,
        prefer the shorter plan, as they think it&nbsp;; in the majority of
        cases it is the shorter plan, for it materially shortens the patient's
        life. Homœopathy, rightly understood and practised, saves the operating
        surgeon a vast amount of work.</p>

D._files/remedes5.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="255" height="288">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font face="Garamond">There
        is a motto which has come down to us from the medical world of antiquity
        which, until homœopathy came, was more honoured in the breach than in
        the observance. The motto runs&nbsp;: "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Primum
        non nocere</font></i><font face="Garamond">"&nbsp;; and may be
        translated&nbsp;: "Whatever you do, don't damage your patient in
        your attempt to help him." If this motto had always been respected,
        the patient-world would never have had to undergo the wholesale
        bleedings and mercurialisings of the past&nbsp;; nor should we now
        encounter patients made deaf by quinine of salicylates, or damaged in
        some way or other by the fashionable drugs of the day. The action of homœopathic
        remedies is essentially gentle. There is no compelling of the organ to
        act in certain ways at all costs. The dynamised homœopathic remedy is
        freed from all crude, poisonous drug effects, and if it fails to help a
        patient it will not leave a residue of a crude drug in the blood.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The working of a homœopathic
        remedy is likely the working of nature itself-it is often imperceptible.
        The patient finds himself cured, and does not know how it took place. As
        Hahnemann described the effects of drugs on the healthy as
        "positive effects," the action of homœopathic remedies on the
        sick may be described as "negative effects." They do not force
        the organism, but they relieve the organism from the influence which is
        hindering the return to health, and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">induce</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        the vital force to resume its normal healthful reaction and vibrations.
        The gentle action of homœopathic remedies is, therefore, the true
        fulfilment of the ancient motto, "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Primum
        non noncere</font></i><font face="Garamond">."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
