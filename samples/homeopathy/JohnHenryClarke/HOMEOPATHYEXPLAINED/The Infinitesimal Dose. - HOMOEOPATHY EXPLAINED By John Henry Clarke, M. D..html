        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="./The Infinitesimal Dose. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/faraday.jpg" alt="Michael Faraday (1791-1867)" align="right" hspace="5" width="168" height="360">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
        an early chapter I mentioned that the infinitesimal dose has become in
        the popular mind the most characteristic feature of homœopathy, though
        the word "Homœopathy" itself in no way includes
        "infinitesimal" in its meaning. Its use arose in this way.
        When Hahnemann began to employ drugs with the precision his method
        required, he found that the ordinary doses acted much too powerfully,
        and caused great aggravation of symptoms before the cure took place. He
        then by degrees reduced his doses until he could get the curative effect
        without aggravating. In some instances he found that the attenuating
        process actually developed and increased the curative powers of the
        medicine. The method he adopted was dilute tinctures in the proportion
        of 1 to 99 of rectified spirit, and to grind insoluble substances with
        sugar of milk in the same proportions. For the higher attenuations the
        process was repeated, the same proportions being observed at each step.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The importance of the
        invention of this method of preparing drugs is very great, scarcely
        second, in my opinion, to that of the discovery of the law of similars
        itself. It is highly probable that but for the question of the
        infinitesimal dose, homœopathy would have been recognised by the
        profession at large long ago. But homœopathy (though it may be
        practised by those who never use anything but material doses) never can
        be dissociated from a knowledge of the power of the infinitesimal, and
        never could have been developed anything like the perfection and power
        in which Hahnemann left it, apart from the use of infinitesimals. Hence
        the popular association of the two ideas of homœopathy and
        infinitesimal is fundamentally true, though it may be etymologically
        faulty.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will be seen that in
        Hahnemann's centesimal scale, each step of the process divides the
        original quantity by 100, and hence each higher number represents a
        higher degree of attenuation. But the attenuation is so graduated that
        no matter to what high figure it is carried, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">something</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of the original substances must remain, though it may be far beyond the
        power of chemistry to detect its presence.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homœopaths have also
        used a decimal scale of attenuation. This makes each remove a divisor of
        ten. This is noted by the letter "x," 1X being 1/10th, 2X
        being 1/100th, 3X being 1/1000th and so on. Graduated attenuation is the
        essence of the method, and the result is development of power.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researches of
        Faraday, Tyndall, Helmholtz, Crookes and, later, of the Curies and other
        investigators of the phenomena of radio activity, have made it easier to
        conceive of infinitesimal quantities and their powers, and the
        infinitesimal of homœopathy should not therefore prove such stumbling
        blocks to its friends and foes as they have done heretofore. When we
        find Helmholtz saying that at the period when our planetary system
        consisted of a sphere of nebulous matter reaching to the path of the
        outermost planet, it would require "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">several
        millions of cubic miles of such matter to weigh a single grain</font></i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;;"
        and when Faraday tells us that " </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">each
        atom extends, so to say, throughout the whole of the solar system</font></i><font face="Garamond">,"
        it is plain that the everyday conceptions of matter and its
        possibilities will have to be revolutionised There is nothing more
        worthy of investigations by masters of physical science than the facts
        connected with the action of homœopathic infinitesimals. The human body
        is a much more sensitive reagent than anything known to natural
        philosophy, and in conceiving and demonstrating the powers of
        infinitesimal quantities Hahnemann was as much ahead of his time as he
        was in demonstrating the existence of the law of similars.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The quotations I have
        just made are taken from a pamphlet entitled </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">The
        Science of Homœopathy</font></i><font face="Garamond">, by Mr. Buist
        Picken, in which the author seeks to apply the known facts of the
        phenomena in the world of physics to explain the fact of Homœopathic
        cures. To this pamphlet (which the late Prof. Tyndall characterised as
        "marked by extreme ingenuity') I contributed a short introduction,
        summarising the argument, and it may be interesting to quote a passage
        therefrom. It will serve at once to show the line in which a scientific
        explanation of the apparent paradox of "like" curing
        "like" may be found, and of the other paradox of a smaller
        quantity of the right remedy being actually more powerfully curative
        than a larger one would be.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my summary of
        the argument&nbsp;:-</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img border="0" src="./The Infinitesimal Dose. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/koch.jpg" alt="Robert Koch (1843-1910)" align="right" hspace="5" width="248" height="350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The
        forces of the human organism are identical with the forces of nature,
        and obey the same law. Health and disease are dynamic or spiritual in
        nature, and originate in molecular and atomic motions. The law of motion
        applies to the phenomena of health and disease, and the action of
        remedies is identical with the phenomena of 'interference' recognised in
        the natural sciences. As equal waves of water proceeding from different
        directions intersect each other ('interfere'), and either increase (as
        summit corresponds to summit), or annual (as summit corresponds to
        furrow), the motion of the molecules of water, so a medicine (whose
        power is dynamic) acts in disease. When the molecular disturbance of the
        organism corresponds to the molecular motion of the medicine given, the
        intensity of the disturbance is either aggravated or annulled, according
        as the action is in the same or the opposite direction. The action of
        the curative agent is like in appearance, but contrary in
        direction." This is the main thesis of Mr. Picken's article, but
        there are several other points brought out which well deserve serious
        attention. For instance, the author shows that each substance possesses
        the property of absorbing any motion which corresponds to its own
        molecular motion (illustrating the like-to-like formula). He brings
        forward the fact that (in Prof. Tyndall's words) "the waves which
        are most effectual in shaking asunder the atoms of compound molecules
        are frequently those of least mechanical power. Billows, to use a strong
        expression, are incompetent to produce effects which are readily
        produced by ripples" - as showing a possibility of elucidation a
        law of dosage on the grounds of physical science. He contends that, as
        Boscovich says, atoms are to be regarded as "centres of
        force&nbsp;;" or, according to Faraday, that "force
        constitutes matter&nbsp;;" - that there is no "space"
        other than some quality of matter between the particles of vapours,
        liquids, and solids alike&nbsp;; - that, for example, "water is not
        two particles of oxygen and hydrogen side by side, but the two spheres
        of power mutually penetrated, and the centres even coinciding&nbsp;;
        " or, as he puts it in another place, "Gravitation is a
        property of matter dependent on a certain force, and it is this force
        which constitutes matter. In this view, matter is not merely mutually
        penetrable&nbsp;; but each atom extends, so to say, throughout the whole
        of the solar system, yet always retaining its own centre of force."
        "What do you know of the atom," asks Faraday, "apart from
        its force&nbsp;? You imagine a nucleus which may be called a, and
        Surround it by forces which may be called </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">m</font></i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;;
        to my mind the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">a</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        or nucleus vanishes, and the substance consists in the power of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">m</font></i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;:
        "- which provides the highest scientific authority for the
        suggestion that it may be impossible to reach the limit of the
        attenuation to which Homœopathic medicines may be carried.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The conception of the
        action of infinitesimal provides a serviceable working basis&nbsp;; but
        it need not be regarded as either essential or final. It is an attempt
        to provide an explanation of the facts, but the facts are in no way
        dependent on its correctness.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img border="0" src="./The Infinitesimal Dose. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/pasteur.jpg" alt="Mr Pasteur et la Rage - Le Grelot - 1885" align="left" hspace="5" width="200" height="298">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many
        old-school authorities have adopted Homœopathic remedies into their
        text books but the effect on general practice has not been great,
        principally for the reason that they have not had the courage to adopt
        Homœopathic dosage. They reduced their own doses very far-as far as
        one-tenth or one-hundredth of a grain, or a drop of some remedies - but
        they have not gone far enough. Pasteur and Koch, who have been working
        on Homœopathic lines, have spoiled their work for the same reason. If
        Pasteur had simply taken, the Homœopathic preparation of hydrophobic
        virus, which has been in use since 1833, and which was prepared without
        any resort to cruelty, he would have gained no kudos, it is true&nbsp;;
        but he might have advanced science, and saved himself from the reproach
        of having killed numbers of persons with laboratory hydrophobia. Koch,
        again, if he had taken the tuberculin of the homœopaths [See Dr.
        Burnett's </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">New Cure of
        Consumption</font></i><font face="Garamond">], and adopted the
        Homœopathic dosage, might have spared himself the trouble of
        experimenting on guinea-pigs, and have saved Virchow the trouble of
        making a number of post-mortem examinations on the bodies of human
        beings who died before their time in consequence of his tuberculin
        treatment. Koch reduced his dosage as for as he dared -down to
        milligrammes - but these doses proved powerful enough to kill, and to
        scare most practitioners from ever using the drug again. Homœopaths,
        however, use it with perfect safety in their own dosage, guided by the
        effects it has produced on persons who took it in the trails that were
        made with it at first, and by the symptoms of Homœopathic provings.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
