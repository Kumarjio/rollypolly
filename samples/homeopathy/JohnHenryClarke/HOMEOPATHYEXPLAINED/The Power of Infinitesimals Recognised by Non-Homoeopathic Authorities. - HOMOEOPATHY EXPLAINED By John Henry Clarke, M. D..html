        has been desired for his assertion that metallic bodies like flint and
        copper become, after being triturated to the fourth centesimal degree,
        so far soluble as to yield up their dynamic powers to a watery solution,
        and beyond that to solution in alcohol. That such is the fact, the
        efforts of these solution on healthy and diseased human being, who have
        taken them, abundantly prove&nbsp;; and now we have plenty of evidence
        from the opposite camp to confirm Hahnemann's observations. The late
        Professor Stokvis, of Amsterdam, at the International Medical Congress,
        held at Rome in April 1894, practically acknowledged the truth of it.
        Professor Stokvis's address appeared in an English translation in the
        Lancet of April 26th of that year, and from this I will make three
        quotations, the italics being my own&nbsp;:-</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"How are we to
        understand the fact that the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">ingestion
        of infinitesimal quantities of certain substances which pass through the
        organism with out causing in it the least change can provoke such
        disordered chemical actions as to occasion death&nbsp;?</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        How are we to understand the fact that different parts of the organism
        seem to be able to distinguish these substances one from the
        other&nbsp;? We must admit special elective functions proper to the life
        of the cells. How are we to understand the facts that nothing but a
        change in the quantity of their dosage, the duration of their
        administration, and the method of their application </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">suffices
        to make of certain toxic substances stimulants or paralysants&nbsp;?</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        How are we to understand the fact that </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">insoluble
        substances</font></i><font face="Garamond"> like arsenic, copper, and
        lead can defy that well known axiom, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Corpora
        non agunt nisi soluta</font></i><font face="Garamond"> (substances do
        not act except in a state of solution), and manifest therapeutic and
        toxic action&nbsp;? We must admit the presence and agency of some
        unknown power within the living cell. How, again are we to understand
        the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">therapeutic power</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        exhibited by solutions of iodine and bromine which have </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">apparently
        been diluted to the deprivation of all chemical action</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        unless we attribute to the living cell the power of liberating the
        iodine and the bromine from such dilute solutions&nbsp;?"</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By warming pure
        chlor</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">ate</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of potassium we obtain pure oxygen, but the presence of the smallest
        quantity of chlor</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">ide</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of potassium is sufficient to change part of the oxygen into ozone. In
        giving rise to this development of ozone, the choride of potassium
        remains itself completely unaltered&nbsp;; but, what is more remarkable
        yet, this chloride of potassium itself has, like peroxide of manganese -
        which acts in an identical manner - the property of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">destroying</font></i><font face="Garamond">

D._files/nageli.jpg" alt="Karl Wilhelm von Nageli (1817-1865)" align="left" width="208" height="320">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As
        for the manifestations of therapeutic and toxic action by bodies
        considered to be insoluble, of which Nageli, in a posthumous work, has
        made so profound a study, they are also capable of the simplest
        interpretations. The insolubility of these bodies is not absolute, but
        only relative. If we throw, for example, metallic copper into water and
        wait for some days, we shall find that a certain proportion of the
        copper has dissolved - </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">i.
        e., one part to seventy-seven million parts of water. "</font></i></p><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Professor Stokvis
        can account for the power of copper to produce symptoms in the human
        body by its being soluble in 77,000,000 parts of water, where is he to
        stop&nbsp;? The only answer to this is, that there is no stopping
        anywhere. If "every atom extends throughout the whole solar
        system," there is no possibility of our finding the limits of its
        capacity for being attenuated.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Professor Stokvis
        was far within the mark in ascribing an active power to a solution of
        the strength of one in seventy-seven millions. Dr. William P. Wesselhœft,
        in a paper published in the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Journal
        of Homœopathics</font></i><font face="Garamond"> of September 1898,
        tells how Nageli demonstrated the presence of an active copper force,
        which he termed </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Oligodynamis</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        in solutions ranging from one in 100,000,000 to one in 1,000,000,000.
        Nageli showed that when once a glass vessel has been
        "infected" with "oligodynamic water" it is almost
        impossible to get rid of the force by simply diluting it. "He
        distilled one litre of water in glass retorts, suspended four clean
        copper coins in this water during four days, and found that this
        solution killed his Spirogyra plants in a very few minutes. When this
        water was poured away, the glass rinsed and washed carefully, and again
        refilled with neutral water, the Spirogyra also died in a very short
        time. If, however, the glass was washed out with diluted nitric acid,
        and refilled with fresh neutral water, the plants flourished and
        remained healthy. This proved conclusively that a </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">copper
        force</font></i><font face="Garamond"> was imparted to water from the
        walls of the glass vessel. Rinsing, washing, brushing and even boiling
        had little effect upon the glass&nbsp;; not until a mineral acid had
        been used did the glass vessel lose its oligodynamic properties. Again,
        he found that this oligodynamic water poured into a new, clean glass
        vessel transferred its poisonous properties to the walls of the glass,
        and this, in turn, was again able to medicate neutral distilled water.
        He says&nbsp;:- 'Glasses with oligodynamic after-effects (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">nachwirkung</font></i><font face="Garamond">),
        lose their power very slowly after being repeatedly refilled with
        neutral water, which is allowed into stand in them for a while, and
        somewhat more rapidly if they are boiled in neutral water.' " This
        refers to the direct action of the copper force on small vegetable
        organisms. But the human organism is infinitely more sensitive&nbsp;;
        and experience has shown that when dilution has been carried beyond the
        point of direct poisoning power, a health-restoring dynamics remains in
        undiminished force, which the homœopathic law enables us with certainly
        to direct.</font></p><font face="Garamond">

D._files/darwin.jpg" alt="Charles Darwin (1809-1882)" align="left" hspace="5" width="172" height="198">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
        this connection I may refer to Darwin's researches with the fly-catching
        plant, Drosera, or Sun-dew. Darwin found that solutions of certain salts
        of ammonia stimulated the glands of the tentacles and caused the latter
        to turn inwards. He made this solution more and more dilute, but still
        the plant was able to detect the presence of salt Darwin was almost
        frightened by his results. Writing to Dodders he says&nbsp;:-</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 1-4,000,000th
        of a grain absorbed by a gland clearly makes the tentacle which bears
        the gland becomes inflected&nbsp;; and I am fully convinced that
        1-20,000,000th of a grain of the crystallised salt (</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">i.
        e.</font></i><font face="Garamond">, containing about one-third of its
        weight of water of crystallisation) does the same. Now I am quite
        unhappy at the thought of having to publish such a statement." [See
        Dr. C. H. Blackley's Power of the Infinitesimal, published as No. 31 of
        the Tracts of the Homœopathic League Series.]</font></p><font face="Garamond">

D._files/darwin2.jpg" alt="Caricature - Charles Darwin (1809-1882)" align="right" hspace="5" width="180" height="250">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor
        Darwin&nbsp;! Where would homœopathy have been if Hahnemann had been so
        difficult about publishing proved but unpalatable facts&nbsp;? And
        Darwin, it should be remembered, was once under the care of a homœopath,
        the late Dr. Gully, the father of the present Speaker of the House of
        Commons, and derived much benefit from his treatment.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The world is moving
        rapidly, and since the above-named observations on the power of the
        infinitesimal were made, they have been eclipsed and illuminated by the
        astounding discoveries in relation to radio-activity. These were well
        summed up by Dr. Burford in his address as President of the British Homœopathic
        Congress of 1904. Dr. Burford's authority is the well known work on
        Radium by Professor Rutherford, who has shown that "these
        radio-active bodies are continually forming in their own interstices a
        product, which in the case of radium is many thousand times more active
        than radium itself&nbsp;; which, moreover, induces the same
        radio-activity in all bodies exposed for some time to it, and which, to
        the extent of 1/20000th of its original potency, remains a new and
        permanent property of the acquiring body. These processes are above and
        beyond the cognisance and scope of the most refined chemical methods.
        Here is a demonstration&nbsp;: A tube out of which a perfectly invisible
        emanation from radium, and possessing absolutely no weight, has been
        emptied, is next washed out with an acid&nbsp;; this is evaporated,
        leaving a radio-active residue more potent in some respects than radium
        itself, requiring 200 years to decay half value. Moreover, in rooms
        where radium has been exposed to the air, an invisible radio-activity,
        perfectly undetectable by the balance or the spectroscope, is produced
        on the walls of the apartment, persisting even though the radium has
        been removed for some time."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="./The Power of Infinitesimals Recognised by Non-Homoeopathic Authorities. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/burford.jpg" alt="Dr Burford" align="left" hspace="5" width="100" height="103">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now,"
        says Dr. Burford, "facts parallel to these, but where the human
        body, in certain defined states of diseases, acted with similar
        susceptibility to the electroscope in the former instance, were observed
        Hahnemann a century ago, and have been confirmed by innumerable
        observations since. That matter too attenuated to be obvious to the test
        of the balance, or analysis should yet be detected by a suitably
        sensitive instrument, that of diseased proto-plasmic condition&nbsp;;
        that initiation of new conditions may be effected in a responsive state
        by inconsiderable material agencies, and bearing absolutely no relation
        in point of quantity to the effects produced&nbsp;; that transmission of
        specific qualities through a series of indifferent media may be
        effected, leaving the ultimate product still potent to act&nbsp;; that
        media thus used for transmission of specific qualities through a series
        of indifferent media may be effected or leaving the ultimate product
        still potent to act&nbsp;; that media thus used for transmission retain
        permanently their new character&nbsp;; and that a specific and definite
        parallelism controls the interaction of remedy and organism - these
        facts, I say, have been known to homœopaths since Hahnemann, and may be
        verified by any competent observer who cares to take the trouble."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Burford does well
        to point out that the phenomena of radium illustrate how it is that
        "indifferent media" like water, spirit, or sugar of milk, once
        having been infected, as it were, with the power of a remedy can
        transmit that drug-power to the patient who takes it. Radium can
        transmit its own power to indifferent media that come in contact with
        its emanation, can endow these with its own properties without itself
        appreciably losing either power or substance. Thus have the observations
        of physicists demonstrated the truth of Hahnemann's teaching from
        another side. Homœopathic attenuations have been described as
        "bottle washings." Well, Professor Rutherford practically
        tells us that once a bottle has held radium or its intangible,
        unweighable emanation, no amount of bottle-washing can get it out. The
        bottle may be filled and emptied a million times and the power of radium
        will be still present. Homœopathy who have seen the power of remedies,
        which have been attenuated in the same way, manifested in their
        patients, find nothing starting in this. But it is well that it should
        be put clearly before the public. On the professional mind I do not
        anticipate that it will have any effect at all. The ray has not yet been
        invented which can pierce that.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann's conception
        of the "dynamic," spirit-like, vital force animating the
        material organism as being the primary seat of all disorders which
        appear outwardly in the symptoms of disease, makes it easy for his
        followers to apprehend the potency of medicines in the
        "dynamised" form.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img height="238" alt="Dr Paul Francis CURIE (1799-1853)" src="./The Power of Infinitesimals Recognised by Non-Homoeopathic Authorities. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/curiep02.jpg" width="182" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before
        quitting this part of my subject it may be interesting to point out that
        M. Pierre Curie, the joint discoverer of radium comes of a good homœopathic
        stock. His father, with whom he now lives, is a retired homœopathic
        practitioner. His grandfather was the celebrated Paul Francis Curie,
        who, apparently on Hahnemann's nomination, was induced by Mr. William
        Leaf to settle in England for the purpose of introducing homœopathy to
        the British public and to British medical men. Dr. Curie administered
        the first homœopathic dispensary in London under medical auspices&nbsp;;
        and, later, when the Hahnemann Hospital was established, he was
        appointed one of the physicians. There he delivered his well-known
        lectures. He died in London, and was buried in Norwood Cemetery. A
        cousin of M. Pierre Curie - Dr. Depoully - is a respected homœopathic
        practitioner of Paris at the present time.</p>
