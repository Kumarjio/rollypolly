D._files/clarkandrew.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" alt="Sir Andrew Clark (1826-1893)" width="220" height="333">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        late Sir Andrew Clark was one of those who boldly proclaimed the reign
        of medical anarchy. In a lecture published shortly after his death, Sir
        Andrew said, in reference to a disease about which he was lecturing,
        "There are no fixed principles for the treatment of the
        disease&nbsp;;" and he immediately added, "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Medicine
        is the Most Unprincipled of Sciences</font></i><font face="Garamond">."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A statement of this
        kind, though true enough of the medicine he knew and practised, is such
        a grave libel on Hahnemann and his work that it calls for strenuous
        repudiation. Less than a hundred years ago it might have been said truly
        enough&nbsp;; but ever since the consciousness of a </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">want</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of principle in medicine was impressed with crushing force upon the mind
        of Hahnemann, and impelled him to the gigantic labours by which he
        brought order out of chaos, the reproach of unprincipledness lies only
        with that section of the profession which has steadily refused to accept
        the gift he has offered to the world.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long it will take
        to bring about the change none can tell&nbsp;; but sooner or later the
        school of Sir Andrew Clark will have to open its eyes to the fact that
        medicine is not the unprincipled, anarchic thing they delight in
        proclaiming it to be. Again and again in his earlier writings, Hahnemann
        bewailed the "absence of any principle for discovering the curative
        powers and medicines. " That in an ordered universe some law - some
        principle - must exist, he could not. How he set about the search which
        ended in his discovery of the law of similars, on which he has built a
        real Science and Art of Cure, will be duly set forth later in my sketch
        of Hahnemann's career. But I will append to the remarks of Sir Andrew
        Clark another utterance by one of his own school, recorded in Dr.
        Granier's Conferences on Homœopathy. Sir Andrew Clark's predecessors,
        whilst giving a graphic description of the anarchic state of traditional
        medicine, has the candour to admit that homœopathy stands on an
        entirely different footing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the course of a
        debate on "Revulsion," which took place in the Academy of
        Medicine of Paris about the year 1853, Dr. Marchal of Calvi contributed
        a paper in which, whilst taking care to say "he did not constitute
        himself a defender of homœopathy," he thus described the want of
        principle in his own school, and the possession of principle or doctrine
        by the homœopathic.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In
        medicine," says Marchal, "there is not, nor has there been for
        some time, either </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">principle,
        faith</font></i><font face="Garamond">, or </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">law</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        We build a tower of Babel, or rather we are not so far advanced of
        people pass backwards and forwards&nbsp;; some carry bricks, others
        pebbles, others grains of sand&nbsp;; but no one dreams of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">cement</font></i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;:
        the foundations of the edifice are not yet laid, and as the general plan
        of the work, it is not even sketched. In other words, medical literature
        swarms with facts, of which the most are periodically produced with most
        tiresome monotony&nbsp;; these are called </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">observations</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">clinical facts</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        a number of labourers consider and reconsider particular questions of
        pathology or therapeutics - that is called </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">original
        labour</font></i><font face="Garamond">. The mass of such labour and
        facts is enormous&nbsp;; no reader can wade through them - </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">but
        no one has any general doctrine</font></i><font face="Garamond">. </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">The
        most general doctrine that exists is the doctrine of homœopathy. This
        is strange and lamentable, a disgrace to medicine, but - such is the
        fact</font></i><font face="Garamond">."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disgrace to
        old-school medicine in 1853 is very much greater when it is unblushingly
        proclaimed by one of its leader in 1893, and this time without any
        reverse in favour of the only </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">system</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        which has the principle of Cure for its foundations - the system of homœopathy.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond"><img border="0" src="./The Principle of Cure by Medicines Revealed by Hahnemann. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/remedes10.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="208" height="324">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allopathy
        or orthodox medicine has, how ever, this much to be said for it. Though
        it has no rule, no "doxy," no system, it has one fairly
        definite aim, namely, to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">palliate</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        It has developed with a great deal of success many measures for
        relieving pain and for getting rid of symptoms. That this is often
        matter of very great importance and advantage, as in the use of
        anæsthetics, will not be denied. But it is not without its dangers
        also. A writer in the daily press has recently put this point very
        forcibly in the following passage&nbsp;:-</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Where modern
        pharmacy works its wonders is in the treatment of symptoms and here in
        is its danger for an impatient and unthinking public. </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Who
        can tell how much of the nervous and physical breakdown of modern life
        may not be due to the abundant means</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        which the chemist has provided for </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">extinguishing
        the danger signals of nature</font></i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;?"
        [Daily Graphic, November 1, 1904.]</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this
        question is, that very much mischief is most certainly due to this
        cause&nbsp;; but homœopathy is a science which is able to make use of
        symptoms without obscuring them&nbsp;; to take them for its guide and
        remove them by curing the patient. Whereas allopathy seeks first of all
        to extinguish the signals of danger, homœopathy by means of the signals
        is able to reach and annihilate the danger itself.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Homœopathy, by
        revealing the principle of cure, sheds a new light on all other methods
        of using drugs. The homœopath can avail himself of any of their uses
        which may seem to him to his patient's advantage. Only, he does not
        delude himself with the idea that palliating symptoms is equivalent to
        curing patients.</p>
