Examples. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/stluke.jpg" alt="St Luke" align="left" hspace="5" width="195" height="270">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It
        may be well here to make it plain that the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">word</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        "Homœopathy" in no way includes "infinitesimally
        small" in its signification. It is of Greek origin, and means
        literally "like suffering." Those who like to have Scripture
        authority for all things may be interested to know that, in its
        adjective form, it occurs twice in the New Testament, and is translated
        in both instances "of like passions" (Acts xiv. I5&nbsp;;
        James v. 17). Curiously enough, St. Luke, the physician among the
        Evangelists, is one of the two writers who used the word. So far as I am
        aware, there is no "Scripture for allopathy."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How the notion of
        infinitely little became attached to the word "Homœopathy" is
        not difficult to trace&nbsp;; and the importance of Hahnemann's
        discovery of the power of infinitesimals will be dealt with later
        on&nbsp;; but Hahnemann chose "Homœopathy" as embodying in a
        single word the "like to like" idea. </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Similia
        similibus curantur</font></i><font face="Garamond"> - likes are cured by
        likes - expresses the same thing, in Latin. This, and this only, is the
        etymological signification of the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">word</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        The </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">idea</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        Hahnemann did not pretend to have originated&nbsp;; in fact, he very
        laboriously collected from previous writers in all ages a mass of
        evidence to show that others before himself had recognised a relation
        between the diseasing action of drugs on the healthy and their curative
        action on the sick. What Hahnemann did that others had not done before,
        was to study drugs systematically by testing them on the healthy.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other way of
        studying drugs is the one which has existed from earliest times - that
        of trying them on the sick and seeing what will happen. And, I may say,
        a great deal of very valuable information has been gained in this
        way&nbsp;; but until Hahnemann studied medicines by systematically
        testing them on the healthy, this information was more or less
        indefinite. Further, the old system had generated a sort of vicious
        circle in medical thought. A drug "X" being found by
        experience to allay spasms in a case, is called an
        "antispasmodic," and the word "antispasmodic" is
        imagined to explain its virtues. Henceforward it is given in case of
        "spasms" because it is an antispasmodic. But in reality the
        dubbing of a drug 'antispasmodic' tells us no more about its actual
        powers than Moliere's "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Quia
        est in eo virtus dormitiva</font></i><font face="Garamond">" tells
        us of the soporific properties of opium. By his experiments Hahnemann
        supplemented the old knowledge in this way&nbsp;: he showed that the
        drugs which have the power of relaxing spasms in the sick have also the
        power of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">causing</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        spasms in the healthy&nbsp;; and he also showed that each
        spasm-producing drug has some peculiarity of its own which will be a
        guide to its selection in any case of disease. There are no such things
        as "diseases" in the abstract to treat, only diseased
        persons&nbsp;; and each case must be individualised and treated on its
        own merits, and not according to the name of the disease by some drug
        that has been named the "anti" to it.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="./The Word  Homoeopathy.  Advantages of the Homoeopathic Method of Studying Drugs. Examples. - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/remedes11.jpg" width="392" height="271"></p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To take a concrete
        example, let us look at two drugs -</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        Each of these drugs, when taken by the healthy, produces intense
        rheumatic pains in the joints, ligaments, and muscles. But Hahnemann
        noticed in himself and fellow-experimenters this marked difference-that
        whereas the rheumatic pains of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        caused the experimenter to keep as still as possible since every
        movement increased them, the pains of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">rhus</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        on the other hand, made him extremely restless, motion giving temporary
        relief. This gave Hahnemann the key to their employment in disease, - </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        relieving cases in which the pains are made worse by motion, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        those in which motion relieves. It would have been of no services to
        have dubbed them both "anti-rheumatics," so he dispensed with
        such useless and misleading designations, and contented himself with
        recording their positive effects.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A new science
        necessitates a new terminology, and it may be well to explain here one
        of Hahnemann's technical terms. When Hahnemann experimented on healthy
        persons with a drug, he called it </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">proving</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        the drug. He used, of course, the German word "Prüfung" -
        testing. In mathematics we "prove" our results by doing our
        sum the reverse way. So Hahnemann "proved" the powers of drugs
        to cure the sick by observing the symptoms they caused when given to the
        healthy. One who took a drug for the purpose of observing its effects he
        called a "prover." The recorded effects of such an experiment
        he called "a proving."</font></p><font face="Garamond">
