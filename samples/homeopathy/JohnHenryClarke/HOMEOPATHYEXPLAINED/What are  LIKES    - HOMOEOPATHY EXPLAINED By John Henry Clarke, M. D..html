        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="./What are  LIKES    - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/edison.jpg" alt="Thomas Alva Edison (1847-1931)" align="left" hspace="5" width="230" height="310">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        Homœopathic Law says that "Likes cure likes." Therefore it
        becomes necessary to make it clear just wherein the likeness between
        case and remedy lies. The cases already quoted from Hahnemann's practice
        have given readers an idea of the points of resemblance which the
        prescriber has to look for, but it will be useful to look at the matter
        more in detail.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long ago it was
        announced in the daily press that an assistant of Edison's had lost his
        life through cancer set up by X-ray burns. This fact made some
        impression on the public mind, since at the present moment the treatment
        for cancer most in vogue in the profession (if the case is beyond the
        reach of the surgeon's knife) is by these same X-rays. "Is not this
        homœopathy&nbsp;?" asked several inquirers&nbsp;; " X-rays
        have caused cancer, and they are also used to cure it." Once wise
        allopathic medical man replied to the query that " he could not see
        any resemblance between X-rays and cancer." Very likely he could
        not&nbsp;! But then Hahnemann never said that the likeness was to be
        sought between the physical characters of the remedy and the appearance
        of the disease from which a patient may be suffering. And it must be
        remembered that it is Hahnemann's definition of "likes" which
        counts, and nobody else's. The "likes" of homœopathy is
        resemblances between drug-</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">effects</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        and disease-</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">effects</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        The effect of X-rays on some persons is to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">cause</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        cancer&nbsp;; therefore, says Hahnemann, under favourable conditions,
        and in suitable persons, X-rays must prove a </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">cure</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        of cancer. That X-rays will not cure all cases of cancer is
        certain&nbsp;; the suitable cases must be found out by future
        observation of both the causative and curative effects of the rays
        themselves.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
        "likeness," then, which homœopathy looks for is resemblance
        in effects. There are some drugs which produce such complete pictures of
        natural diseases that cases of poisoning have been mistaken for them.
        The annals of poisoning are full of instances of this kind&nbsp;: the
        medical practitioners in attendance have given certificates of death
        from natural disease, when later investigation has proved that the death
        was caused by poisoning. An instance of this kind occurred not long ago
        in America, when poisoning by </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Cyanide
        of Mercury</font></i><font face="Garamond"> was certified as death from
        diphtheria. Again and again cases of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        poisoning have been mistaken for scarlatina. When the resemblance
        between a drug disease and a natural disease is so close as this, it can
        be inferred with absolute certainty that the drug which manifests the
        "likeness" will be a remedy of wide usefulness in the
        treatment of cases of the disease. Accordingly </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Mercurius
        cyanatus</font></i><font face="Garamond"> is a remedy with homœopaths
        of proven usefulness in diphtheria&nbsp;; and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        not only modifies the course and symptoms of scarlatina, but it also
        acts as a prophylactic against infection. If </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        in the 3rd centesimal potency were given to the healthy members of a
        household when scarlatina breaks out in it, the epidemic will not
        spread. Were this fact generally known among school proprietors, and
        enormous amount of trouble, anxiety, and loss might be saved to them.
        This is one small point in the immense importance of a knowledge of homœopathy
        to the community at large.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it is necessary to
        guard against the idea that because certain drugs produce a more or less
        perfect facsimile of certain natural diseases, that every disease must
        have its natural counterpart and cure. The instances in which a single
        drug produces such a perfect picture are rare&nbsp;; and when they do
        occur, it must be understood that many cases of the disease will require
        other remedies for their cure. Homœopathy has no cut and dried remedies
        for cut and dried disease.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherein, then, are we
        to look for the likeness&nbsp;? </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">It
        lies in the character of the symptoms produced by the drugs,
        corresponding with the character of the symptoms present in every case
        of disease</font></i><font face="Garamond">.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./What are  LIKES    - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/hahnem92.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="205" height="272">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann
        quickly discovered that symptoms observed in providings did not all
        posses equal value. He noticed that when any peculiar or out-of-the-way
        effect came out in a proving, this had especial value in prescribing
        when the same symptom was met with in a case of disease.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This peculiarity need
        not be in the actual symptom itself, it may be in the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">conditions</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        under which it manifests itself&nbsp;; or it may be in some </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">concomitant</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        which is found associated with it. It is in being able to discern and
        utilise these points the most of the art of homœopathy lies, and it is
        on this that success in treatment largely depends.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give one or two
        illustrations. A patient who suffered severely from headache complained
        that one for her sensations was "as if woollen were wrapped round
        the head </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">inside the
        skull</font></i><font face="Garamond">." Now that is a most
        peculiar sensation, and to cure the case it would be necessary to find a
        symptom somewhat like it accredited to some remedy. In my search, by the
        aid of repertories, I found this&nbsp;: "Sensation as if a cold
        cloth were wrapped round the brain." This was produced by the salt
        of the American spring named </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Sanicula</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        I gave it to my patient in the 1000th potency, and it rapidly removed
        the entire train of symptoms, which also corresponded to other effects
        of the remedy. In this case the sensation of there being something
        wrapped round the brain was the peculiar feature in which drug and
        disease were "like." And although the sensation of the
        wrapping material was different, the likeness was close enough to effect
        a cure.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other cases the
        point of correspondence that it is essential to match lies in the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">conditions</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        under which they symptoms appear, or are either better or worse. An
        octogenarian patient of mine, of very fine physique, a devotee of the
        morning cold bath, was troubled with a rheumatic pain in the right arm
        and elbow, which annoyed him very much, as it interfered with a
        favourite occupation, namely, driving a spirited pair of horses. Now the
        drugs which produce pains in the arms are legion. It was necessary,
        therefore, in this case to ascertain if there was anything peculiar in
        the time or circumstances under which the pain occurred. I elicited that
        the pain woke him in the night, and the only way in which he could get
        relief was by getting </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">into
        his cold bath</font></i><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;; after this he
        could return to bed and sleep.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now here was a marked
        peculiarity-relief from cold bathing. Most rheumatic conditions are
        worse from contact with water of any king, and especially cold water.
        Among the drugs which cause rheumatic pains which are relieved by cold
        baths there is one which stands out pre-eminent, and this is </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Ledum
        palustre</font></i><font face="Garamond">. </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Ledum
        palustre</font></i><font face="Garamond"> 30 was given and quickly cured
        the patient. (It may interest some of my readers and enable them to tack
        this characteristic condition to their memories, if I mention that the
        plant </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">flourishes in cold
        water</font></i><font face="Garamond">-that the marshes are its home.) I
        instance this case to show the usefulness in homœopathy of noting
        peculiar conditions, all repertories to the Materia Medica must, to be
        complete, include in their indices a list of CONDITIONS under which
        symptoms are better or worse, or appear or disappear.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another class of
        conditions which are of great importance to watch in prescribing a
        Conditions of Time. It is well known that some complaints are worse at
        certain hours of the day or night, and very often this condition is of
        as much importance from the prescriber's point of view as the symptom
        itself. A very common symptom in connection with many diseases is a
        "sinking," "empty" sensation, occurring at times
        when the patient should not ordinarily be 'hungry. Now many remedies
        have caused this sensation, and among them is </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">sulphur</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        But the time when the Sulphur sensation is most marked is from 11 a. m,
        to noon. Other medicines have the same peculiarity but not so markedly
        at this hour&nbsp;; when a "sinking" sensation is complained
        of at about 11 o'clock, </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        will be the most likely remedy to relieve the whole condition.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A very characteristic
        time of aggravation has been noticed in connection with Lycopodium, and
        this is from 4 p. m. to 6 p. m. or to 8 p. m. When this particular time
        of aggravation appears in any complaint, the likeness to the
        time-aggravation of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        will give a very strong point, indeed, in favour of that remedy being
        the right one&nbsp;; and if other symptoms correspond it must be given.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions of motion or
        rest, of heat or cold are other points of importance in the
        "likeness" between remedies and cases, which the homœopath
        has to take into careful account in marking his prescriptions.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another point of
        "likeness" lies in accompanying conditions, or
        "concomitants," as they are called. Some patients manifest
        certain morbid symptoms as a regular accompaniment of other complaints.
        For instance, a patient has neuralgia, and every time the pain comes on
        it is accompanied by an attack of sickness and vomiting. Now of all the
        remedies which cause sickness, Ipecacuanha is one of the first which
        will be thought of. We all know </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        wine, and most of us have experienced its effect at one period or other
        of our lives. The nauseating property of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        dominates, in senses, all its other effects. If it causes pain, the </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">pain
        is accompanied by nausea or vomiting</font></i><font face="Garamond">.
        If it causes fever, the chill </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">is
        accompanied by nausea or vomiting</font></i><font face="Garamond">. Thus
        it comes about that any kind of illness which sets up as a concomitant
        effect nausea or vomiting may find in </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        its "likeness" or counterpart, and hence its remedy. In a
        similar way the sleep-causing power in </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        dominates its effects and whenever excessive drowsiness accompanies
        other complaints it will very probably be found that </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        will prove the remedy most like to the case.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These are a few of the
        points of "likeness" with the homœopath must look for if he
        is to make successful prescriptions. This is the "likeness"
        which Hahnemann referred to when he formulated his law that "Likes
        cure Likes." To the unprofessional observer it might seem a more
        desirable thing to find pictures of entire diseases, and thus find a
        remedy for each&nbsp;; but in practice that would not work so well.
        Hahnemann has by the art he revealed liberated by materia medica and the
        prescriber. Any remedy is thus available for use in a case of any
        disease, and the prescriber is free to select his remedy throughout the
        entire range.</p>
