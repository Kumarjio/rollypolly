        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having sketched the
        origin of homœopathy and described many of its salient features, it
        seems to me that it might be well to devote a few chapters more
        particularly to certain practical details. For, as before remarked,
        there is no excuse for any one to either believe or disbelieve in
        homœopathy&nbsp;: the proof lies within the reach of any person of
        intelligence, if he likes to take the trouble to put the principle to
        the test.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before one can make
        the trial, it is necessary to know something of the agents that are to
        be made use of and tested. This brings us to the query that I have put
        at the head of this chapter- "What are Homœopathic Medicines&nbsp;?"
        Possibly my readers will say, "</font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Aconite,
        Bryonia, Belladonna, Chamomilla, Hepar sulphuris, Mercurius, Nux Vomica</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        - these are homœopathic remedies" may be defined for ordinary
        purposes as "Medicines used by homœopaths"&nbsp;; and every
        one of the remedies named above comes under this definition. But a
        number of these remedies are also used by allopaths&nbsp;; and,
        therefore, by the same process of reasoning it would be correct to
        describe these as allopathic remedies also.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Strictly speaking, a
        medicine is neither allopathic nor homœopathic </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">in
        itself</font></i><font face="Garamond">, but only in its use-the same
        remedy is either one or the other according as it is prescribed in a
        case of disease. For example, it is just as true to say that </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        is an allopathic medicine as it is to say that is a homœopathic
        medicine. One of the well-known effects of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        (when taken, for instance, to deaden the sufferings of neuralgia) is
        that, among other effects, it causes constipation&nbsp;; when,
        therefore, it is given to </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">cure</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        a patient of constipation it is a homœopathic remedy. On the other
        hand, when it is given to a patient suffering from diarrhœa, to check
        the diarrhœa, it is an allopathic remedy, or, rather, to be perfectly
        accurate, an antipathic remedy.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a sense in
        which some remedies are peculiar to homœopathy, having been introduced
        to medicine through the homœopathic providings, and having been used
        almost exclusively by homœopaths. </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla,
        Sepia, Silica</font></i><font face="Garamond">, and </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        may be named as examples of these. But homœopathy claims the whole
        realm of drug action as its rightful property, awaiting its service for
        homœopathic use. It is only necessary that the positive effects or a
        drug shall be known, for homœopaths to be able to make their own
        peculiar use of it. The constipation-causing action of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        is a positive effect, which a homœopath may make use of for </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">curing</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        cases of constipation. This is the homœopathic or </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">negative</font></i><font face="Garamond">
        effect, as it has been called.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img border="0" src="./What are Homoeopathic Medicines   - HOMOEOPATHY EXPLAINED By John Henry Clarke, M. D._files/remedies2.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="206" height="350">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But
        we have not even yet exhausted the reply to our query - What are homœopathic
        medicines&nbsp;? We have arrived at this answer - "Homœopathic
        medicines are medicines which can be used homœopathically." But
        then comes this further consideration-Are there not special homœopathic
        chemists&nbsp;? And if the question whether a medicine is homœopathic
        or not is only one of use, why cannot any chemists supply the same
        remedies for both schools&nbsp;?</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The answer to this very
        proper query is, that remedies need to be differently prepared when used
        in different ways. Going back to our example of </font><i><font face="Garamond" color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i><font face="Garamond">,
        the homœopath who wished to cure a case of constipation would not give
        it in the same way, or in the same form, as an allopath would, who gave
        it to relieve pain. Hahnemann soon found out that patients were
        infinitely more sensitive to the remedies which were homœopathically
        related to their cases than they were to other remedies. Therefore he
        was compelled to reduce the quantities very much below the ordinary
        dosage current in his day. He gave single drops or half drops of the
        original tinctures, where the dosage in the books was set down as
        teaspoonfuls. Then he found that even these apparently minute doses were
        too great in many cases, and thus he was led to invent this method of
        attenuating remedies, which I have described in another chapter, and to
        discover the powers of infinitesimal quantities.</font></p><font face="Garamond">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hence arises a new
        definition for the term "Homœopathic medicines" -Homœopathic
        medicines are medicines that have been specially prepared for
        homœopathic use. Their preparation needs special skill, and herein lies
        the necessity for a separate class or trained chemists to supply the
        wants of homœopathic doctors.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The full reply to our
        query, therefore, must be-Homœopathic medicines are medicines which,
        having been tested on the healthy body, can be used homœopathically,
        and which have been specially prepared for homœopathic use.</p>
