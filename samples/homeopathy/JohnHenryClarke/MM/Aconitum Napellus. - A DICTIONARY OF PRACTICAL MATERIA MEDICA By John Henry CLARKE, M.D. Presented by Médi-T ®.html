        "grows in the damp and covered parts of almost every mountainous country in north or
        middle of Europe, especially in the Jura, Switzerland, Germany, and Sweden." Teste
        mentions that it has the reputation of being much more poisonous to carnivorous animals than
        to the herbivora. This he partly endorses, and it has recently been apparently confirmed by
        a vain attempt to poison an elephant with <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconitine</font></i> in
        this country. A carrot was scraped out and enough <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconitine</font></i>
        to poison 2,000 men was put in. The elephant ate it readily, but nothing at all happened,
        and three hours later a large dose of prussic-acid had to be administered, which proved
        fatal in a short time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Before Hahnemann's time <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> had a
        reputation as a sudorific, and in cases of rheumatism, sciatica, and tumours, but it was not
        till Hahnemann proved it that its properties were really, understood. Aconite is more
        closely associated with the rise and progress of homœopathy than any other member of the
        materia medica. If <i><font color="#0000ff">Cinchona</font></i> was the "Newton's
        apple" of the homœopathic discovery, <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> was
        the remedy by means of which Hahnemann was able to meet most of the conditions which in his
        day were treated by blood-letting. It was <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> more
        than any other remedy which paved the way for the disappearance of blood-letting from
        general medical practice. One of the deadliest and most rapidly acting of poisons, through
        Hahnemann's discoveries has been turned into the best friend of the nursery. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> in potencies above the 3rd is a perfectly safe medicine
        for any age. Sensitive patients complain of its depressing action when repeated, and I have
        known instances in which the characteristic prostration of mind and body has occurred after <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> had been given in the potencies. But such cases are
        exceptions, and are not attended with danger when they do occur. The great majority of
        patients to whom <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> is given in the potencies
        experience nothing of the kind.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The rapidity of action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        determines its appropriateness for conditions in which the symptoms set in with great
        intensity, such as Asiatic cholera, certain fevers, and acute inflammations. To this list
        may be added attacks of sudden blindness. But it must not be supposed that the sphere of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> is limited to acute cases. When the symptoms correspond
        it will cure cases of great chronicity<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>for example, cases of indurated
        glands.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Hughes has acutely remarked that the condition to which <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> is homœopathic is one of <i><font color="#0000ff">tension</font></i>;
        and this word gives the best idea of the action and sphere of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>.
        There is emotional and mental tension, as shown in fright or fear and its consequences,
        anxiety, and fear of death; tension of the systemic vessels, as in the effects of a chill,
        Asiatic cholera, and hæmorrhages; muscular tension, as in tetanus; tension of involuntary
        muscles, as in heart spasms, and tension of the semi-involuntary muscular apparatus of
        respiration, as in asthma; and finally tension of the special senses in heightened sensation
        and heightened sensitiveness to pain; in a feeling of numbness in parts, as if bound
        tightly, and also a sensation of being tightly bound in the limbs and in other parts. Hence
        it is that <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> in its therapeutic action corresponds
        to the effects of a number of conditions which excite a state of tension. Plethora may be
        classed under this head. Plethoric persons of a lively character, bilious and nervous
        constitutions, high colour, brown or black hair, are specially suited to <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. Active, sanguineous congestions of all kinds, especially
        those following chill. Guernsey puts it in another way: "The pure and fully developed
        blood globule, in its most perfect type, when diseased, has a great affinity for <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. When the blood globules are disorganised it is seldom
        indicated. We think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. in sudden inflammation,
        especially if caused by cold, <i><font color="#0000ff">dry air</font></i>, suppressing
        exhalations of the body." Teste relates a remarkable case of an Englishman who had been
        obliged to take a long sleigh journey in North Russia in midwinter, who suffered thereafter
        for two years from violent paroxysms of palpitation and acute stitching pains in the heart
        region, threatening cerebral apoplexy. Aneurism had been diagnosed by leading physicians in
        England and on the Continent. Teste localised the affection to neurosis or spasm of the
        pectoralis major muscle, and proved his diagnosis by promptly curing it with <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. The keen, cutting winds of the mountains amongst which the
        plant flourishes give the signature of this remedial action.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are not many drugs which have causation so strongly marked among
        their characteristics. Chill, fright, injury, or surgical operation<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>the
        effects of these will be met in large majority of cases by <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.,
        the timely administration of which will ward off serious results.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The reaction from the primary effect of chill gives another
        characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>that of
        fever. With the <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. fever there are: Restlessness and
        tossing about, and the tension state is evidenced still in the anxiety with which it is
        accompanied, sometimes amounting to fear of death. The mental exaltation sometimes goes so
        far as to the predicting of the day and hour of death. Clairvoyance. Extreme sensitiveness
        to light and sound and all sensations including pain. When the sickness is borne with
        calmness and patience <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. is not likely to be
        required. It was the feverish restlessness of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.
        provings that led Hahnemann to infer its homœopathicity to so many fever states; and it is
        the presence of this restlessness, anxiety, fear, and exalted sensibility which are its
        leading indications in cases of all kinds.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Some characteristics of <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. are the
        following: Active hæmorrhages in stout, plethoric people. Passes almost pure blood by
        stool. In hæmoptysis the blood comes up with great ease by hemming and coughing, bright red
        in large quantities, from cold, dry winds, with great fear, anxiety, and palpitation. Every
        inspiration increases the cough. After the cough tingling sensation in chest. Unquenchable
        thirst: everything tastes bitter, except water (<i><font color="#0000ff">Chi</font></i>.
        everything, <i><font color="#0000ff">including</font></i> water). In croup the child grasps
        the throat with every coughing fit. Coldness, numbness, and tingling characterise the
        paralyses and neuroses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. Facial paralysis from
        exposure to cold, dry winds. The fear and apprehension of <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.
        is shown in dread of crossing streets. There is intolerance of music. Some curious symptoms
        are: Imagines some part of body is deformed. Imagine they do all their thinking from the
        stomach. Predicts the hour of death (clairvoyance).</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. is one of the great <i><font color="#0000ff">pain</font></i>
        remedies, vying with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cham</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i>
        in the intensity of the pain it causes. Pains are intolerable, driving to desperation. The
        pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. are tearing, cutting; are attended with
        restlessness; accompanied by numbness, tingling, or formication. <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.
        cannot bear the pain, cannot bear to be touched, cannot bear to be covered. The toothache of
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. is one-sided, with red cheek on same side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Guernsey gives the following excellent directions: "If a child is
        suffering from a watery diarrhœa, is crying and complaining very much, biting his fists and
        is sleepless, <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. will usually settle this trouble in
        a short time. The disturbed condition of the mind will cease and quiet sleep will follow.
        The mother will now remark: "Doctor, he is all right, except his bowels, and they are
        as bad as ever." Now, do not give another remedy, but wait and see if <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. will not complete the cure by itself." Again: Scanty,
        red, and hot urine, arising from taking cold, especially in children. The child screams and
        appears to be in great pain because it cannot urinate. <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.
        will ease the pain, quiet the child, and the urine will flow some time after. In adults,
        incontinence of urine will sometimes be relieved by <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a great and sudden sinking of strength; fainting on attempting
        to get up; with anxiety, restlessness, numbness, tingling, formication.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. has a very wide sphere of usefulness in affections of
        the eye. Inflammation, of many kinds, from cold, injury, dust, surgical operations,
        scrofulous inflammation with enlarged glands, all come within its range. Some remarkable
        cases of sudden blindness have been cured by it. Hirsch of Prague records two such cases,
        one in a man of thirty, who went to bed well, having walked home in rough and stormy weather
        after spending the evening in a hot room. <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. 3 was
        given, and the following night he perspired freely, and in the morning his sight was
        thoroughly restored. Hirsch himself suddenly lost his sight whilst bathing in hot weather.
        He took <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. 3 in water as he had given it to his
        patient. In two hours he began to perspire, and after a six-hours' sleep awoke well. Lippe
        has recorded the case of a lady whom he found much distressed, anxious, fearing paralysis.
        In her usual, health she had taken a full dinner, and when reading afterwards, the letters
        danced before her eyes, and the print became blurred; then face and nose became numb; pulse
        small, 120 a minute. One dose <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. c.m. (Fincke) was
        given. The numbness disappeared in half an hour; Pulse 72; the sight was perfect when she
        closed either eye, but everything looked indistinct when she kept both open. This symptom
        disappeared next morning; a slight lightness of the head remaining that day.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The time of the aggravation of <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.
        symptoms is chiefly night and about midnight. <i><font color="#0000ff">Heat</font></i>, as
        well as <i><font color="#0000ff">cold</font></i>, is injurious to the <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. patient; sunstroke is among the conditions which call for
        it; and <i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. will cure many headaches caused by
        exposure to the sun, and also sun-erythema. Headaches are generally <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        in open air, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in warm room; toothache and cough <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in open air. <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> From

        from drinking (any kind of liquid). <i><font color="#0000ff">Rest</font></i> <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> the symptoms generally, but during the night the pains are
        intolerable, limbs feel tired and rigors are worse. Lying relieves headache and vertigo, and

        and stitches in chest; lying on side <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> stitches in
        chest and cough: the cheek lain on sweats. Rising from a seat <b><font color="#0000ff">=</font></b>
