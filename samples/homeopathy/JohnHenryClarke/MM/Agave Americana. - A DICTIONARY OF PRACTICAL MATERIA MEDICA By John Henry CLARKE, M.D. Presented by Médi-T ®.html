        is an unproved remedy. The juice of it fermented is the Mexican intoxicating beverage called
        "Pulque." The plant has a local reputation as a remedy for hydrophobia. A striking
        case is quoted by the <i><font color="#0000ff">H. Recorder</font></i> from <i><font color="#0000ff">El Siglo Medico</font></i>. A boy developed the classical symptoms of
        hydrophobia four and a half months after being bitten: Quarrelsomeness, excitement, fright,
        inability to swallow, small frequent pulse, great anxiety. Finally swallowing was
        impossible, restraint had to be used to prevent him biting his nurses in the hospital, when,
        as a last resource, a piece of <i><font color="#0000ff">Agave</font></i> was offered to the
        boy by the doctor in attendance, cut from a hedge of the plant with which the hospital
        grounds were fenced. To the astonishment of all, the boy reached for it and ate it greedily,
        almost without chewing. By evening a decrease in the violence of the nervous attacks was
        manifest, though they remained as frequent as before. The improvement was slow but
        continued. On the fourth day he took some nourishment, but also continued chewing <i><font color="#0000ff">Agave</font></i> and swallowing the juice. On the fifth day he recovered
        consciousness by still demanded <i><font color="#0000ff">Agave</font></i>. On the eighth day
        he said he did not want any more as "it tasted too bitter and caused a burning in the
        mouth." He had no further symptoms of the disease. According to Hansen <i><font color="#0000ff">Agave</font></i> is indicated in scurvy, stomacace, and painful erections in
        gonorrhœa.</p>
