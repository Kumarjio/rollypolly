        is one of the oldest and most famous drugs. It is in worldwide use as a purgative at the
        present day, and forms a leading ingredient in a large number of patent medicines for
        regulating the bowels and menstrual functions. The habitual use of these medicines leads to
        all kinds of pelvic ailments, and the fact that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        antidotes <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i> accounts for the success of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sul</font></i>. as a medicine to commence with in many chronic cases where
        purgatives have been used. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i> resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">All. s</font></i>. somewhat closely. It causes congestion of various parts,
        especially abdomen, pelvic organs, and head. A periodicity enters into many of its
        complaints. There is a periodic headache which alternates with lumbago. As winter approaches
        each year itch manifests itself. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i> has the antipsoric
        property of throwing out internal complaints to the skin. Among the leading mental symptoms
        are: Bad humour, especially in cloudy weather. Dissatisfied and angry with himself <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> when constipated. Aversion to labour. Lassitude alternating
        with great mental activity. Among the other head symptoms are: Darting pains in left temple <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> every step. Carroll Dunham cured a heavy frontal
        incapacitating headache in an old man occurring in winter and alternating with a diarrhœa
        which occurred in summer when he was free from headache. A peculiar dull, heavy, pressing
        pain in forehead, but which indisposes to, or incapacitates for, all exertion, especially
        intellectual. Heaviness in the eyes as with <i><font color="#0000ff">All. s</font></i>.
        Pressure in vertex and forehead as from a weight. Compelled to make the eyes small during
        pain in forehead. There are yellow rings moving before eyes. As there are illusions of
        sight, so there are cracklings in the ears. One symptom is very peculiar: just after getting
        into bed, sudden explosion and clashing in left ear, as from breaking of glass; the clink of
        the glass was heard at the bottom of the head and extended thence toward the right ear. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i> exerts its most marked influence on the abdominal and pelvic
        organs. It causes uneasiness and pains in liver region. Fulness, heaviness, heat and
        inflammation. The whole abdomen is painfully sensitive to touch. Rumbling. Feeling as of a
        plug wedged in between pelvis and coccyx. Sudden and continued desire to go to stool. Desire
        for stool after each meal (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ars., Chin., Lyc., Pod., Trombid.; while</font></i>
        eating, <i><font color="#0000ff">Fer.</font></i>). Rumbling and cramp in abdomen before and
        during stool. The hard stool falls out without being noticed, urging to stool whilst passing
        water; every time on passing water feeling as if stool would pass. A hard stool may be
        passed involuntarily. A child, constipated from birth, screams all the time he is being held
        to stool, cannot pass it, even after enema; yet when not trying passes solid pieces in bed
        without knowing. Cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Alo</font></i>. 200 (Nash). Involuntary
        soft stool while passing wind. With the diarrhœa, flatulency, pinching in abdomen, pain in
        back and rectum and chilliness. Flatus offensive, burning, copious; much flatus with small
        stool. Burning in anus with passing of flatus. Stools like mush, bright yellow, grey, hot,
        undigested. Mucus and blood in fæces. Profuse with jelly-like lumps. Watery stools <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> standing or walking. Watery stool containing lumps
        "like frog-spawn." Bilious yellow fæcal, bright yellow diarrhœa, great rumbling
        in bowels and escape of much wind, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> morning;
        evening; in damp weather; from overheating; after cold taken in damp room; after chagrin.
        Diarrhœa driving one out of bed very early in morning (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sul</font></i>).
        Diarrhœa with sense of insecurity (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phos</font></i>.) Faintness
        after stool; with cold sweat. Griping may (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nux v</font></i>.) or
        may not (<i><font color="#0000ff">Merc</font></i>.) cease after stool. Heaviness, heat,
        pressing, burning in rectum. Itching, burning in rectum. Itching, burning, pulsating as from
        fissures at anus. After stool: cutting feeling as if more would come protruding piles. Hæmorrhoids:
        protrude like a bunch of grapes constant bearing-down in rectum bleeding; sore; tender, hot;
        <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by cold water. Carroll Dunham has cured
        incontinence of urine in an old man with enlarged prostate with the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
        diarrhœa. Increased sexual desire in males, with erections. Penis shrunk and testicles
        cold. In females pain in hypogastrium as if menses coming on. Labour-like pains drawing into
        legs. Menses too early and too profuse. During menstruation: headache <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by application of cold water; earache; pain in small of
        back; pressing down in rectum. Fulness in pelvis. Leucorrhœa of bloody mucus preceded by
        colic. Pain in small of back, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> sitting or awaking at
        night, <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> moving about. Lumbago alternating with
        headache. There is <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in afternoon, especially of
        symptoms of mucous membranes. Many symptoms, again, appear in the evening <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> yawning, or masticating. There is a diarrhœa <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in the early morning (like <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph</font></i>).
        Diarrhœa <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> immediately after eating; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> walking (<i><font color="#0000ff">Æsc., Thuj.</font></i>),
        or standing (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sul</font></i>.). Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Phos</font></i>.,
        it has feeling of insecurity on passing wind or before stool. Symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> from heat; in hot, damp weather; <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        from cold applications; in cold weather. <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> From
        passing flatus. <i><font color="#0000ff">It is suited to</font></i>: old people; to women of
