        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Characteristics.<i>&#9472;</i></font></b>Like its relative <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumen, Alumina</font></i> produces irritation of mucous membranes with
        dryness or extreme secretion and paralysis of involuntary muscles, as those of the rectum
        and of the nervous and muscular systems generally. <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i>
        paralyses the bowels in the same way as lead, to which it is an antidote. Even small and
        soft stools are passed with great difficulty. Pregnant women and children are liable to this
        kind of constipation. A very prominent characteristic is that a person must <i><font color="#0000ff">strain at stool</font></i> in order to <i><font color="#0000ff">urinate</font></i>.
        Teste groups <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Copaiva</font></i>. He considers it the chronic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> as <i><font color="#0000ff">Silic</font></i>. is of <i><font color="#0000ff">Puls</font></i>. Paralysis of the internal rectus muscle of the eye, causing
        squint. Also ptosis. Drawing, pains appear in the limbs; a sensation of constriction in
        several organs. Several painful symptoms show themselves after the midday meal, and continue
        till evening, when they disappear or are replaced by others which begin only then. On the
        other hand the pains which appear in the morning or in the evening are abated after eating.
        Trembling, convulsive movements of the limbs and head; spasms, with tears and laughter
        alternately. There is exaltation of the whole nervous system. Trembling of the whole body
        with desire to lie down, which, however, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> the
        fatigue. Great general fatigue, even after a short walk, but chiefly after speaking.
        Frequent stretching while sitting. The nates go to sleep while sitting. Drags legs
        (especially left). Many of the symptoms of locomotor ataxy are reproduced by <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i>, and it is one of the most useful remedies in that
        disease. Bœnninghausen cured a case with <i><font color="#0000ff">Aluminium</font></i>.
        Sluggishness of action is characteristic of this medicine; urine is slow in passing; great
        straining to pass even a soft stool; can only evacuate bowels when standing; has to strain
        as if abdomen and rectum were paralysed. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Caust</font></i>. has
        defecation only when standing; but the straining is less.) Sensations are slow in being
        transmitted to the centres. In the mental sphere there is confusion. "When he says
        anything he feels as if another person had said it, and when he sees anything, as if another
        person had seen it, or as if he could transfer himself into another, and only then could
        see." A feeling of hurry follows, things do not move fast enough. Impulses. Suicidal
        tendency, a sudden impulse from seeing blood on a knife. Sad; apprehensive; wants to
        getaway; fears going crazy. Mental symptoms mostly come on in the morning on waking. Vertigo
        on closing eyes. Catarrh is a very general feature. Catarrh with dryness of mucous
        membranes. The throat looks parched and glazed. The nose is stopped, feels dry, and the
        point of it is cracked. <i><font color="#0000ff">Alm</font></i>. has the fish-bone sensation
        in the throat on swallowing. There is profuse leucorrhœa running down to the heels,
        sometimes excoriating. As with the mucous membrane so with the skin: itching eruptions <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> from warmth of bed. Eruptions of all kinds, indurations,
        ulcers. Granular eyelids. Hairs fall out all over body. The skin of the face feels as if
        covered with dried white of egg, or as if a cobweb was on it. Fissures. <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> has some curious symptoms in the digestive sphere. There
        is a craving for dry rice and dry food. It has <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> from
        starch, especially the starch of potatoes. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> From
        salt, wine, vinegar, spirits. Burning pains in the back are very characteristic, and
        especially a sensation as if a hot iron were forced through the lower vertebræ.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are pulsations in various parts. The pains go upward. Upper left;
        lower right affected (opposite of Lyc.).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> on alternate
        days; periodically. Guernsey describes a characteristic periodicity thus: "Patient gets
        along nicely for a time, then, from no apparent cause, gets worse for a time, then better,
        and soon a relapse may be worse than the original illness, another relapse not so bad, and
        so on with longer intervals between." In afternoons; at new or full moon; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in the morning on waking. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        After coitus. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> In cold air, out of doors; in dry
        weather. They are <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by cold washing; by moistening
        the part; by warm food or drink; by warmth generally.</p>
