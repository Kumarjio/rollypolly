        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Characteristics.<i>&#9472;</i></font></b><i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>
        has many features in common with its botanical relatives, the different species of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>, especially in its action on the skin, muscles, and joints,
        but it has also very distinct features of its own. A very characteristic sensation is a
        pressing or penetrating pain as from a <i><font color="#0000ff">plug</font></i>, which may
        occur in any locality in connection with neuralgias and ear affection, piles, &amp;c., and
        whenever present <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i> will probably be the remedy.
        Sensation of a hoop or band around the body or about any part is a leading symptom. It has
        been used with success in diseases of the spinal cord with this sensation and the feeling of
        a plug in the spine, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> by any motion which causes a
        pain as if the plug were sticking still further in. Paralysed feeling in knees. Sensation as
        if knees were bandaged.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The nut is heart-shaped (hence its name), and perhaps this may be taken
        as the "sign" of its courage-imparting properties. It has at any rate won for
        itself a reputation in "examination funk" and allied conditions. Brain-fag. Loss
        of memory is very marked. Deafness with loss of memory. Headache <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        by mental exertion; <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by eating. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacard</font></i>. patient has many mental aberrations; is clairaudient,
        hearing voices of persons far away, or dead; voices behind her. Seems to have two wills. Is
        as if in a dream. A curious symptom is a great propensity to swear and blaspheme in persons
        not usually addicted thereto. Irritability. There is also a tendency to suicide by shooting
        (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. crud</font></i>.). Fixed ideas of various kinds: that mind
        and body are separated; that he is double; that a demon sits on his neck telling him most
        offensive things; that he sees everybody's face in a glass except his own. The senses are
        either too weak or too acute, and there ire sense illusions: a light has a halo; optical
        illusions in dark colours; illusions of hearing; illusions of smell: burning tinder,
        pigeon's dung. I cured with it a man who had a smell of burning wood in his nose, remaining
        after influenza. There is a headache proceeding from before backward. Stiffness in nape of
        neck. Stiff-neck <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> beginning to move. Whooping-cough
        with gaping and drowsiness after the cough. Morning sickness of pregnancy <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by eating, but returns soon after. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacard</font></i>. indigestion contrasts with that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux</font></i> in a striking way. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux</font></i>
        the pain is worst for two or three hours after a meal, <i><font color="#0000ff">during</font></i>
        stomach-digestion, and is <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> when that is over;
        whereas with <i><font color="#0000ff">Anac</font></i>. it is just then (when digestion is
        complete) that the pain is worst, and it lasts until the next meal, which again <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> for a time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">E. S. Breyfogle narrates a striking case (an involuntary proving
        illustrating the nerve and skin effects of the remedy. Acting on Bayes' indications,
        "funk before examination," "nerve-exhaustion from over-study,"
        "nervous prostration from seminal emissions," or sexual excess, Breyfogle had used
        the remedy with much success. To a patient, for excessive nervousness, he gave the 1st
        dilution in discs. He took two discs every four hours till eight were taken. Then a sore
        mouth suddenly developed, mucous membrane inflamed, burning, and acutely sensitive. Vesicles
        appeared on roof of mouth, and a dirty membrane peeled off easily. Gums were next affected.
        Mouth dry, taste offensive: at the same time a papular eruption on wrists and ankles, later
        on inside-arms and legs, chest, neck, back, especially defined in bends of knees and elbows,
        and worst of all about anus. Scratching <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> but was
        compelled to scratch all the same. Water as <i><font color="#0000ff">hot</font></i> as could
        be borne <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> instantly. Simultaneously the nervousness
        disappeared. "I haven't had a nerve since. It has made a profound impression on my
        nervous system." Later came a sudden sense of complete prostration: knees gave way; had
        to keep a flask of whisky by him to relieve it. Later: cold chills ran over body at least
        exposure, even putting arms out of bed; feared he was going to be ill, slept with hot
        bottles on chest all night. As eruption in mouth disappeared salivary flow increased; it ran
        from his mouth on pillow during sleep. "Feels as if a particle of food were in
        œsophagus; swallows constantly to get rid of it."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is not the same <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> by rest
        and <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by motion as with <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>,
        but many symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> by commencing motion
        (stiff-neck). Headache is <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> lying down. Piano-playing
        caused heaviness and fulness of the whole body. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus, Anac</font></i>.
        has chilliness, liability to take cold, sensitiveness to draughts, and <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> from warmth. The symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        morning, and again evening to midnight. 4 p.m.: heat daily. The cough of <i><font color="#0000ff">Anac</font></i>. is <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by eating.
        Symptoms generally <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by eating; recur two hours
        after.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is intermittence in the symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Anac</font></i>.
        "The attacks ceased for one or two days, and then continued again for a couple of
        days." Guided by this indication alone, Custis cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Anac</font></i>.
        200 a case of sleeplessness in a pregnant woman: "Spells of sleeplessness lasting for
        several nights." <i><font color="#0000ff">Anac</font></i>. is suited to affections of
        the palms of the hands. There are warts even on the palms.</p>
