        tart</font></i>. resembles closely <i><font color="#0000ff">Antim. crud</font></i>. and the
        other Antimonies in its action, though the modalities differ. <i><font color="#0000ff">Antim.
        tart</font></i>. was the favourite emetic of olden times, and consequently it is one of our
        best remedies in states of nausea. The nausea is as intense as that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipec</font></i>., but less persistent, and is <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        by vomiting. Nash has found it the nearest thing to a specific in cholera morbus, the
        indications being "nausea, vomiting, loose stools, prostration, cold sweat, stupor, or
        drowsiness." In chest affections of all kinds it is indicated where there is great
        accumulation of mucus with <i><font color="#0000ff">coarse rattling</font></i> and inability
        to raise it. Drowsiness and even coma may accompany cases of all kinds in which <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. t</font></i>. is called for. The face is pale or cyanotic and the
        breathing stertorous. There is heat about heart and warmth rising up from it. A sensation of
        coldness in the blood-vessels. A correspondent of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Chemist and
        Druggist</font></i> (May 21, 1892) related the case of an apprentice who had been employed
        for a week making up "cough-balls" and diuretic balls for horses, both containing
        powdered antimony. He had been cautioned not to inhale the powder, but his employer believes
        he did. At the end of the week he was seized with an illness, due, his employer thinks, and
        no doubt correctly, to the antimony. The symptoms are very characteristic. First, there was
        nausea, lassitude, and a desire for sleep. He was sent to bed, and during the night his
        fellow apprentice said he got up and struggled to relieve himself of an imaginary load on
        the chest. On being put to bed again, a profuse perspiration broke out, and also a peculiar
        rash on his face and chest; after that he vomited freely and felt better. Temperature 104,
        pulse 120. A fever-mixture of liq. ammon. acet. and Sp. æther. nit. was given. A doctor who
        was called in found undoubted symptoms of pneumonia of left lung, but confessed he had never
        seen the rash before and would not venture an opinion regarding it. For two days the
        temperature kept at 104, then both temperature and the pulse became normal, the rash
        disappeared, and with it the pneumonic cough; in six days the boy was perfectly well.
        "A child coughs when angry" is characteristic. Heath cured a case of
        whooping-cough in a child who was very fretful before the cough. The mother said that if the
        child got angry she immediately had a fit of coughing. "Cough at 4 a.m." is
        another indication which I have found true. Further leading indications for this remedy are:
        attacks of fainting, internal trembling. It causes relaxation of sphincters and muscles,
        with nausea or without. Os uteri dry, tender, undilatable, with distress, moaning, and
        restlessness with every pain (<i><font color="#0000ff">Aco</font></i>.), feeling of
        sickness. Convulsive twitching. Convulsions. Great heaviness in all the limbs and great
        debility. Rheumatic pains (fever), with perspiration, which does not relieve. Inflammation
        of internal organs. Gastric and bilious complaints. Constant nausea<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>nausea
        felt in chest (<i><font color="#0000ff">Puls</font></i>.). Sensation of weight or heaviness
        in many parts; head, occiput, coccyx, limbs. Pulsations in all the blood-vessels. The child
        wants to be carried and cries if any one touches it. Peevishness, whining, and crying.
        Inquietude, apprehension, agitation. Dulness and bewilderment of head as if benumbed.
        Chronic trembling of head; of head and hands (as in paralysis agitans). The tongue has a
        thick, white, pasty coat with red papillæ showing through. Intense nausea and vomiting with
        great effort; with perspiration on forehead. Fulness and sensation of stones in abdomen
        especially when sitting bent forward. The skin is notably affected. The typical eruption is
        like that of small-pox, the symptoms of which disease are so closely reproduced in the
        proving that it has been used instead of vaccine for inoculation purposes, and prophylactic
        power has been claimed for it. (Compare <i><font color="#0000ff">Variolinum</font></i>.) The
        terrible backache of small-pox is paralleled by the back-pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant.
        t.</font></i>, which I have found to correspond to more cases of lumbago than any other
        remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. t</font></i>. is also a "sycotic," and I
        have verified a symptom given in Hering, "warts at the back of the glans penis." <i><font color="#0000ff">Antim. tart</font></i>. has <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> by
        warmth, but not the excessive sensitiveness to heat and sun of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant.
        c</font></i>., and some of the rheumatic symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        by warmth. Warm drink <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> cough, also lying in bed,
        especially becoming warm there. There is also <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> from
        cold and damp, but not the ill effects of cold washing found in <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant.
        crud</font></i>. Also cold washing <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> the rheumatic
        toothache of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. t</font></i>. Both have <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        from touch and even from being looked at. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. t</font></i>. has <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> on sitting down; when seated; and on rising from a seat; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> sitting bent forward; <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        sitting erect. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> Lying on side affected. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> Motion, on every effort to move. A characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. t</font></i>. in lung affections is "lies with head back."
        There is not the <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> from rest which is apparent in
        many symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. c</font></i>. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant.
        t</font></i>. headache is <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> by rest; also earache and
        respiration. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> At night is more marked with <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. t</font></i>. than <i><font color="#0000ff">Ant. c</font></i>. Cough is
