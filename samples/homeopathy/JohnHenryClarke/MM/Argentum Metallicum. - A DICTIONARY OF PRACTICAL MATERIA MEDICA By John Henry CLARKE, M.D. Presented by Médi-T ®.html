        affects all the cartilages, and hence all joints and bones, with tearing and bruised pains,
        tenderness and weakness; painful, so-called "hysterical" joint, articular
        rheumatism without swelling; pain in rib cartilages and especially the left. Exostosis on
        skull. The muscular system is also affected with cramps in limbs; calves feel too short on
        going downstairs; stiffness; numbness; electric-like shocks in joints and limbs; painless
        twitchings. The heart is specially affected; frequent, spasmodic, though painless twitchings
        in whole heart muscle, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> lying on back; fears
        apoplexy. Sensation as if heart stood still followed by trembling, then irregular violent
        throbbing. Palpitation, at night; during pregnancy. Systemic convulsions. Epileptic attacks
        followed by delirious rage, jumping about, striking those near. In society disinclined to
        talk; discouraged. (Reaction from this: great inclination to talk, mind very clear.) Vertigo
        on entering a room after a walk. Vertigo on looking at running water. As if drunk. Frontal
        headache of business men. Headache increasing gradually and ceasing suddenly, at acme as if
        a nerve being torn, usually l. side. Viscidity of saliva and mucous expectoration, which is
        easy. From the mucous membranes generally there is secretion like boiled starch; or there
        may be thin and at the same time a thick yellow or greenish discharge. Great hunger even
        after a full meal. Extreme dryness of mouth, tongue sticks to palate. (This symptom with the
        polyuria points to diabetes, in which <i><font color="#0000ff">Arg</font></i>. is
        particularly indicated if there is swelling of the ankles.) Spasmodic enuresis nocturna.
        Effects of onanism: impotence; atrophy of penis; bruised pains in testicles. Pains in left
        ovary; feels enormously swollen; with this, prolapse of uterus (scirrhus). Metrorrhagia,
        large lumps with violent pains, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> by every motion. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arg. met</font></i>. acts more on the left side than the right; left ovary
        is affected: "Prolapsus uteri with pains in left ovary." It corresponds to
        deep-seated insidious disease. In the mental sphere it affects the intellect more than the
        affections. Headache of business men. Left-sided headache as if in brain substance. Headache
        and dyspepsia induced by mental agitation, nursing the sick, mental exertion. Suited to thin
        patients with hollow eyes, pale skin, tendency to tubercle, caries, cancer, deep ulcers,
        imbecility. The more deeply seated the troubles are the more likely are they to be painless.
        Tenderness is prominent in <i><font color="#0000ff">Arg. met</font></i>. Tearing pressure
        and pains in the bones. Articular rheumatism without swelling. Parts feel bruised when
        pressed on. Hoarseness of singers and speakers, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        speaking or singing. Laughing causes cough. Restless sleep; electric shock through body
        wakens her. Symptoms <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in sleep; nausea in dreams;
        seminal emissions. On waking, limbs powerless. Paralytic weakness. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        By touch; pressure riding in carriage; lying on back; sitting; stooping. At noon at night
        (profuse urine). Uncovering (chills before midnight). Entering warm room. Sun.</p>
