        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Characteristics.<i>&#9472;</i></font></b>Growing on the mountains, <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> may be said to possess a native affinity to the effects of
        falls. As its German name, Fallkraut, attests, its value as a vulnerary has been known from
        remote times. It may be said to be the traumatic <i><font color="#0000ff">par excellence</font></i>.
        Trauma in all its varieties and effects, recent and remote, is met by <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> as by no other single drug, and the provings bring out the
        appropriateness of the remedy in the symptoms it causes. Tumours in many parts, following
        injury, have been cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, including scirrhous
        tumours of the breast. Nervous affections as chorea after falls. It is suited to plethoric
        red-faced persons; "<i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> is particularly adapted
        to sanguine, plethoric persons, with lively complexions and disposed to cerebral congestion.
        It acts but feebly on persons who are positively debilitated, with impoverished blood and
        soft flesh. This may be the reason why it is eaten with impunity by herbivorous animals as
        Linneus remarks" (Teste). It is suited to persons who are extremely sensitive to
        mechanical injuries, and who feel the effects of them long after; persons easily made
        train-sick or sea-sick. Patients complain that the bed is hard no matter how soft it may be.
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Arn</font></i>. corresponds to the effects of violent cough or
        sneezing; the child cries before cough comes on (or with the cough) in whooping-cough.
        Chronic bronchitis when patients have bruised, weak aching in the chest, or great
        sensitiveness of the chest on exertion, or walking. Allied to wounds are hæmorrhages, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> causes and cures hæmorrhages of many kinds: dilatation
        and rupture of small blood-vessels. Vomiting, coughing, purging, accompanied by streaks of
        blood in ejecta; extravasation of blood into the conjunctiva as in whooping-cough.
        Hæmorrhages into the tissues of internal organs or the skin. An odd symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> is "coldness of the nose." A case of facial
        (left) neuralgia, face swollen, dark red, very painful to touch, was cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">radix</font></i>), the guiding
        symptom being "cold nose." Patient had bitter taste; was very excitable, and <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> at night. Ussher notes that the local use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> produced an extraordinary growth of hair on a limb. This
        suggested the use of an oil mixed with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arn</font></i>. 1x in a case
        of baldness, which was followed with marked success. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arn</font></i>.
        affects the left upper extremity and the right chest. There is a putridity in connection
        with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> excretions, as with <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptis</font></i>.,
        which it resembles in typhoid conditions: putrid breath; fetid sweat. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> there is apt to be incessant passing of stool and urine in
        these states. Nash gives the following as "leaders": "Stupor, with
        involuntary discharge of fæces and urine." "Fears being touched or struck by
        those coming near him." Putrid smell from mouth." "Bruised, sore feeling in
        uterine region; cannot walk erect." "While answering falls into a deep stupor
        before finishing." "Head alone, or face alone, hot; rest of body cool."
        "Many small boils, painful, one after another, extremely sore."
        "Suddenness" is a feature of Arn. pains and action. P. P. Wells relates a cure of
        double pleuro-pneumonia in a child with sudden stabbing pains on both sides of the chest
        almost preventing breathing. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> <i><font color="#0000ff">instantly</font></i> caused a violent aggravation, the next instant relief
        was perfect, and the child fell asleep breathing naturally. I once ran a piece of wire into
        the tip of one of my fingers, causing paralysing pain. I applied <i><font color="#0000ff">Arn</font></i>.
        1x at once, and the pain was better instantly<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>seeming to be wiped out
        from the point of injury up the arm. There is <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in
        damp, cold weather with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, which is included by
        Grauvogl among the remedies suited to the hydrogenoid constitution (comp. <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryt. c</font></i>.). Motion and exertion <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>.
        (Bruised, aching sensation in chest on walking.) <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        Lying down, and lying with head low; but <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> lying on
