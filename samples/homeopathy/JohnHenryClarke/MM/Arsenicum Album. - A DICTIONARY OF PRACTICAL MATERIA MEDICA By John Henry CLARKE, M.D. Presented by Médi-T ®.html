        is the horse's remedy; as <i><font color="#0000ff">Puls</font></i>. is
        the sheep's, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Antim. crud</font></i>. the
        pig's. The reprehensible fashion of "doctoring" horses with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
        is merely an abuse of a therapeutic fact. The horse is an animal on
        whose power of endurance and "wind" enormous demands are made,
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is the remedy for the
        effects of feats of prolonged endurance. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
        habit of the Styrian mountaineers has arisen from the discovery of its
        power of strengthening the muscles both of the limbs and of the
        breathing apparatus. But in another way the horse typifies the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
        temperament. The mental symptoms of my drug, when pronounced, carry
        precedence of all others. The horse is an exceedingly nervous animal,
        constantly moving about, restless to a degree, and very prone to take
        fright<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>quite a picture of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
        temperament. According to Teste <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>.
        acts much more powerfully on vegetable-eating animals than on carnivora
        (opp. <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux v</font></i>.); and it is suited to
        the effect's of excess of vegetable diet, melons, strawberries, and
        fruits in general, especially watery fruits.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The arsenic-eaters of the Tyrol can take as much as
        six grains of white arsenic, or the sulphide, every two days. They
        maintain that it imparts a sense of invigoration and enables them to
        carry enormous loads up perpendicular mountains. According to one
        account it is resorted to by populations who live on vegetable food
        almost exclusively. "It strengthens the muscles," an old
        indulger in the habit is reported to have said, "helps to digest
        our coarse bread and potatoes, and allows us to breathe freely and
        easily. Meat-eaters have no need for such a thing, but with us it is a
        necessity." It is difficult to say how far this is a directly
        "tonic," effect, and how far curative of the dyscrasia
        generated by the conditions of life. The fine skin and glossy hair of
        the young women among the arsenic-eating populations is remarkable, and
        is comparable to the fine coats of arsenic-fed horses. On the other
        hand, "staring coat" in animals, and "dry, rough, scaly,
        unhealthy-looking skin" in human beings are keynote indications for
        the remedy. In this connection may be mentioned the effects on the crew
        of the ship <i><font color="#0000ff">Zion</font></i>, which carried
        arsenic as a portion of its cargo. This was exposed somewhat to the
        sun's rays, and the crew noticed a peculiar smell. Soon they all began
        to notice themselves growing stout, and on reaching Philadelphia from
        England they had all gained much, one to the extent of two stones in
        weight.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Restlessness is one of the grand characteristics of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>.
        Even the stupor of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is
        interrupted by fits of restlessness with anxious moaning. Patients are
        anxious, full of the fear of death, restlessness compelling them to
        frequently change their position. Hence the applicability of the drug in
        many nervous affections, notably chorea. Jerks and starts on falling
        asleep. Irritability, desperately angry; almost furious. Despair,
        hopelessness, unutterable misery. The irritability and sadness of
        malarial cachexias; of the cachexias of quinine, mercury, and syphilis.
        Low types of disease; typhoid states. Inflammations of great intensity
        with tendency to destruction of tissue. Burning, lancinating pains. <i><font color="#0000ff">Burning</font></i>
        is another of the leading characteristics of Arsenic. No other remedy
        has it in more pronounced degree. The peculiarity of the
        "burnings" of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ars</font></i>. is that
        they are <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by heat (herein
        comparing with <i><font color="#0000ff">Capsic</font></i>.). The burning
        in the throat is <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by eating or
        drinking hot things. On the other hand cold food and cold drinks <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        stomach irritations; hence <i><font color="#0000ff">Ars</font></i>. is
        of signal use for effects of eating ices and drinking ice-water. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>.
        affects the entire alimentary tract. The lips are so dry and parched and
        cracked that the patient often licks them to moisten them. The mouth is
        aphthous, ulcerated, or gangrenous. The stomach is so irritable that the
        least food or drink causes distress or vomiting, or stool or both
        together. Abdominal pains are intense, causing the patient to turn and
        twist. Hæmorrhoids are exceedingly painful as if burning needles
        plunged in. States of lowered vitality. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Prostration</font></i>
        of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>. is remarkable. With it
        there is the desire to move or be moved constantly. The patient is
        exhausted from the slightest exertion. Exhaustion is not felt while
        lying still, but as soon as he moves he is surprised to find himself so
        weak. The prostration seems out of proportion to the rest of his
        illness. Must lie down. Exhaustion from hill-climbing, breathless,
        sleepless. Thirst for little and often (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ant.
        t., Lyc</font></i>.), wants it very cold and immediately rejects it (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phos</font></i>.
        as soon as it becomes warm). Before and after the cough of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
        there is an attack of asthma (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phos</font></i>.)
        Arsen. has a great place in acute coryza and hay-fever. The fluent
        coryza is corrosive, reddening the upper lip, and has more burning than
        either <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc</font></i>. or <i><font color="#0000ff">Cepa</font></i>.
        Also it is <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> out of doors, and <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        in warmth, which distinguishes it from <i><font color="#0000ff">Cepa</font></i>
        especially. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is predominantly
        right-sided. The neuralgias affect the right side most; the right lung
        ("acute, sharp, fixed or darting pain in apex and through upper
        third of right lung") is more affected than the left; also the
        right side of the abdomen, hence typhlitis. Many dropsical conditions
        are controlled by <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>. Especially
        has it done brilliant work in cases of hydrothorax. It has been called
        the "liquid trochar," on account of the expeditions way in
        which it will remove a watery effusion. The patient cannot lie down;
        must sit up to breathe; anxious; restless; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        about 1 a.m.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is suited to the full plethoric habit. Puffiness
        in one of its characteristics; and from this to dropsy. All mucous
        membranes are irritated. The skin is cold and clammy. Scurfy eruptions.
        Bran-coloured scales on head coming down to forehead. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
        has cured epithelioma of the lips and closely corresponds to the
        cancerous diathesis. Many cures of cancer have been reported under its
        use, both in the crude and in potencies. When the subjective symptoms of
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>. are present, it will cure in
        the potencies. When the homœopathicity is more crude the lower
        potencies will be required: in this case the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>.
        appears to act directly on the cancerous tissue and cancerous elements
        in the system.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is a hæmorrhagic: it acts on both
        blood and blood-vessels. Varices burn like fire. Anæmia, chlorosis,
        pyæmia all come within the scope of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>,
        which corresponds also to states resulting from losses of blood, as
        venesection, metrorrhagia, hæmoptysis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The Conditions, especially of time and temperature,
        are all-important with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>.
        Unless these correspond in the patient, failure will be more frequent
        than success. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is one of the
        greatest of periodics. I once treated some members of a family who all
        had attacks of fever of short duration, recurring regularly every six
        weeks, from living in rooms papered with arsenical papers. Its periods
        are: every day; every third or fourth day; every fortnight; every six
        weeks; every year. There is pronounced night aggravation, the pains are
        unsupportable with restlessness. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        Midnight and after (<i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>. is rather
        before midnight); <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> 3 a.m. There
        is <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> from cold and damp; <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        warmth. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>. loves warmth like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
        v., Psor., Hepar, Silic., Mag. mur</font></i>. and other hydrogenoids,
        and herein is differentiated from <i><font color="#0000ff">Sul., Ant.

        <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsen</font></i>. hugs the fire and likes warm

        of Acon., but is an anxiety and a feeling that it is useless to take
        medicine as they will surely die (more like Agnus). Bry. drinks much and
