        corresponds to scrofulous conditions in children and old age; dwarfish children and childish
        old people. Old people who are fat. Those liable to take cold easily; sore throat from cold;
        glandular affections. Many cases of aneurism have been cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i>,
        mostly in lower attenuations. It corresponds to the atheromatous condition. A paralytic
        condition runs throughout the pathogenesis. There is paralysis of mind and body. Mistrust;
        want of self-confidence; aversion to strangers (the child does not want to play). It has
        cured a case of fetid foot-sweat with spells of despondency, seeking solitude, sobbing and
        crying. Deficient memory (children cannot remember and learn). Sensation as if brain loose.
        Vertigo: with nausea; from stooping; when lifting arms up; in old people. Pressure and
        sticking in brain, at vertex on waking. It has cured baldness in young people; tinea, wens.
        The scalp is very sensitive to touch. Enlarged glands in occiput and neck. On the face there
        are rough, dry and herpetic eruptions. Dark redness. Tension of whole face as if white of
        egg had dried on it; as if a cobweb (<i><font color="#0000ff">B. acet</font></i>.) over
        face, temples, and scalp. Painful swelling of parotid and of submaxillary glands. The sense
        of smell is very acute. There is an illusion of smell as of pine smoke. Nose-bleed before
        menses. The tongue is paralysed. Salivation; saliva runs out during sleep. The digestion is
        weak; after eating, pressing in stomach; and pain in hard, swollen abdomen. Sensation of
        soreness of stomach; while eating it feels as if the food had to force its way through some
        raw place. It has proved curative in the habitual colic of children who do not thrive;
        enlarged mesenteric glands; hungry, but refuse food, swallowing painful. The anus is sore
        and humid. Piles protrude with urination as well as stool. Constipation, with hard, knotty
        stools; hæmorrhoids, burning and soreness. The paralytic condition appears in the sexual
        organs. Impotence. Soreness and moistening between scrotum and thighs. Enlarged prostate.
        There is also a paralytic condition of the respiratory organs. There is a feeling in the
        larynx as if inspiring smoke or pitch. Hoarseness and loss of voice from cough, mucus in
        larynx and trachea. Suffocating catarrh and paralysis of lungs in old people. Sensation as
        if lungs full of smoke. There is a spasmodic cough, like whooping-cough, from roughness and
        tickling in throat and pit of stomach. Cough <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        evening till midnight; after getting feet cold; exercise; lying left side; cold air;
        thinking of it. Palpitation with soreness of heart, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        lying on left side; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> thinking of it. Violent long
        lasting palpitation; felt in head. Palpitation <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> on
        exertion. Slightest exertion makes him feel tired and sleepy. These heart symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bar. c</font></i>. are met with in many cases of aneurism and atheroma, and
        no remedy has a better record here. I cured an advanced case of thoracic aneurism with the
        3x. <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryt. c</font></i>. has cured tumours of several kinds.
        Induration in the breasts. Sarcoma in neck with burning. Fatty tumours, especially about the
        neck. Swelling and induration of glands. A marked symptom is, pulsation in the back.
        Stiffness and tension in small of back, in evening, especially while sitting, allowing
        neither to rise nor to bend backwards. Painfulness of arms and swelling of axillary glands.
        Cold feet. Fetid perspiration of feet. Corns with burning and stinging. Burning and drawing
        pains are frequent in lower limbs. A case has been recorded in which <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryt</font></i>. removed in an old man a pain, coming suddenly, in hollow
        of knee and running down back of leg like a thin stream of hot fluid or molten metal,
        running down under the skin. Tearing in limbs with chilliness. Tension and shortening of
        muscles. Intolerable irritation all over like prickings and tingling, waking him at night.
        Itching, sore and humid skins.<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>Warts.<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>Burning pains
        are found in many parts. General soreness and sensitiveness. Small wounds ulcerate and get
        very sore.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chilliness predominates. It has cold, clammy feet as notably as <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> Cold air; cold
        washing; damp weather; warm food; in sun (headache); near warm stove (headache). <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> From raising arms, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        from mental emotion. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> Thinking of complaints. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> In company; <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> alone. <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> From cold food. Left side much affected. Offensive sweat of
        one side (mostly left). <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> Lying on painful side; on
        left side. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> After eating. After eating, so weak
