        acts primarily on the brain, and Teste very acutely explains the diversity of its action on
        men and animals by suggesting that it acts with an intensity proportionate to the brain
        development. On goats and rabbits it has no poisonous action whatever. On carnivorous
        animals it acts with moderate intensity. On man it acts with highest intensity. But on
        idiots, as Hufeland mentions, it has no more action than it has on some of the carnivora. An
        enormous number of the symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>. are developed
        in and from the head and sensorium. Conformably with this, the pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>. run downwards, <i><font color="#0000ff">i.e</font></i>.,
        away from the head. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silic</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Gels</font></i>.
        have a pain running <i><font color="#0000ff">up</font></i> the back). To understand aright
        the action and uses of this great medicine it is necessary to bear in mind some leading
        features which characterise its action in all parts of the organism. But before alluding to
        these I will briefly refer to its correspondence to scarlatina. Cases of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> poisoning have frequently been mistaken for cases of
        scarlatina. But it is the smooth form only, these presenting a smooth, even, red surface
        that come under its controlling action and prophylaxis. When such an epidemic is about, any
        one who may be exposed to infection may obtain almost certain immunity by taking <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> two or three times a day.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The several points to be remembered about <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
        are that it is a medicine which has great general sensitiveness and also sensitiveness of
        the special senses<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>sensitive to light; to slightest noise; to motion or
        jar as when someone touches the bed. This is one feature which renders <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>. so appropriate in hydrophobia. It is a <i><font color="#0000ff">chilly</font></i> medicine; sensitive to changes from warm to cold, to
        draught of air, to damp weather, to chilling from having the head uncovered, or <i><font color="#0000ff">having the hair cut</font></i>; better from being wrapped up warmly in a
        room. Under this drug there is a remarkable quickness of sensation, or of motion; the eyes
        snap and move quickly. The pains <i><font color="#0000ff">come and go suddenly</font></i> no
        matter how long they may last. They are in great variety, but throbbing, burning, and
        stabbing are very characteristic: "<i><font color="#0000ff">stabbing</font></i> from
        one temple to the other."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The great intensity and variety of the head pains has caused <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>. to be regarded as the headache medicine <i><font color="#0000ff">par excellence</font></i>. Congestion of blood to the head. Vertigo, mostly
        at night on turning over in bed, or when getting up in the morning, also when walking and on
        every change of position. Headache with flushed face and brilliant eyes, dilated pupils.
        Feeling in brain like swashing of water. Throbbing, pulsating headache, with beating
        arteries and violent palpitation of the heart. It has cured a very severe headache in a
        nervous man occurring whenever he was exposed to tobacco smoke. In the mental sphere are
        mania; rage; disposition to bite, scratch and tear things. Fantastic illusions when closing
        eyes. Dull and sleepy; half asleep and half awake. Spasms and twitchings are very marked.
        Many disorders of vision. <i><font color="#0000ff">Heat, redness</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> are three great characteristic notes of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>., and are constantly cropping out in the pathogenesis. The
        face is purple, red, and hot, or yellow. Redness and pallor alternate. The mouth is
        exceedingly dry without thirst. Stinging in œsophagus, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        swallowing or talking. Œsophagus feels contracted. Sensation of a hand clutching
        intestines. Stool in lumps like chalk. Spasmodic contraction of anus; obstinate
        constipation. Bleeding piles; back pains as if breaking. The menstrual flow is hot; of light
        colour; or bad smell. Cough short, dry, tickling, similar to cough of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rumex</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phos</font></i>.
        Whooping-cough; with crying or pains before the attack; flushed face; nose-bleed and bloody
        expectoration; sparks before eyes; stitches in spleen; involuntary stool and urine.
        Paralysis of lungs and heart (vagus nerve). Violent palpitation of heart. Stitches in chest.
        Swelling of breast with bright red streaks radiating from centre of inflammation. Rheumatism
        <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> by motion. Sweat on covered parts only.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A striking picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellad</font></i>. is
        sometimes seen in cases of worm-fever. A case (æt. 3, pale, feeble child) reported by Lutze
        had the following symptoms: Awakened, or at least sits up at night in bed screaming, cannot
        be pacified; wets bed at night; passes worms now and then; cheeks and ear-tips brilliant
        scarlet, other parts of face, especially round mouth, white as snow; eyes brilliant,
        staring; pupils dilated. Skin dry and hot like fire. On being spoken to coaxingly flew into
        a violent rage. <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> 200 had ameliorated. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>. cm. and m. cured permanently.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>. is a great children's remedy, not less important than <i><font color="#0000ff">Cham</font></i>. Complaints come suddenly; hot, red face, semi-stupor, every
        little while starting or jumping in sleep as if it might go into convulsions. A very general
        characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>. is <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        on lying down. It refers to headache and all kinds of inflammatory affections. Some
        characteristic symptoms are: "Tenderness of abdomen, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        by least jar." "Pressing downward as if contents of abdomen would issue through
        vulva, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> mornings; often associated with pain in back
        as if it would break." Starting, twitching, or jumping in sleep. Moaning in sleep.
        "Sleepy, but cannot sleep." The characteristic skin of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>.
        is: "Uniform, smooth, shining, scarlet redness, so hot that it imparts a burning
        sensation to the hand of one who feels it." "Sweat on covered parts only" is
        also a marked symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A number of cases of poisoning have been reported from application of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> plasters to the skin, classical symptoms of the drug
        being produced and no little danger to life. One practitioner was warned by his patient that
        she could not tolerate a <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> plaster, but he,
        thinking there must have been a mistake, and that cantharides must have been in the plaster
        she had formerly used, had one made up under his own eyes and applied it himself. In less
        than one hour there was an unbearable pain and when the plaster was removed the surface was
        found to be blistered.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A case of poisoning reported in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Medical
        Press</font></i> (September 9, 1891) brings out the profound and long-lasting effects of the
        drug. Three children, aged 7, 5, and 3 1/2, ate a number of the berries. Three days after, a
        doctor saw them. The condition of the eldest was as follows: pupils dilated to maximum and
        insensitive to light; pulse frequent; breathing feeble and hurried; skin dry, bright red;
        temperature lowered; extremities and face cold; urination and defecation suspended. <i><font color="#0000ff">Co-ordination was lost</font></i>; the patient staggered as if drunk and
        acted like a mad person. When asked his name he would shout as loud as he could, <i><font color="#0000ff">falling backwards</font></i> with his hands in the air, his legs slightly
        bent as if about to sit down on a low stool, and then tumble on the floor. When raised from
        the ground and seeing his friends again he began to talk without ceasing, laughing, and
        singing local melodies in a boisterous manner. <i><font color="#0000ff">Suddenly</font></i>
        his whole demeanour would change in to a melancholic depression of agony; he would look
        blank and wild on all around. He would instantly jump up, run at the wall, and endeavour to
        spring on the highest articles in the room with the strength of a wild animal, and it was
        with difficulty that his movements could be controlled.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The youngest of the three lay depressed, in a soporific condition, eyes
        closed, skin cold, limbs powerless. Pupillary reaction, tendon and muscular reflex were
        almost gone, whilst the sense of heat and cold still remained. On shouting loud in his ear,
        he slowly tried to open his eyes in wonder; when shaken and put on his feet he <i><font color="#0000ff">made two or three steps backward</font></i> as his elder brother and fell
        senseless on the floor. The second eldest lay in a deep sleep, face cyanotic; skin of
        extremities and part of body dry and cold; breathing feeble, pulse scarcely perceptible.
        Loudest crying, or shaking could not rouse him; feeling and reaction lost. Washing out the
        stomach was effected in the eldest, but no evidence of the berries was obtained in that way.
        A long injection tube was inserted into the rectum and irrigation with hot and cold water
        alternately was carried out, with the object of exciting peristalsis. This was successful.
        Besides a great quantity of black-brown masticated fruit with skins and seeds, broken
        berries were found to the number of 28 in the case of the eldest, 39 in the second, and 37
        in the youngest. Pilocarpin and morphia were injected in the case of the eldest, and camphor
        subcutaneously in the other two. The skin was rubbed, warm applications administered and
        rectal injections of milk, egg and brandy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Nothing was heard of the children till "June of the present
        year" (1891), [the date of the poisoning is not stated, but it was probably the
        previous autumn] when the children were brought to the doctor by their father. They all
        looked pale and feeble; the pupils contracted slowly, and all were sensitive to light. The
        eldest was irritable and desponding. In the other two hearing and speech were almost gone.
        The almost. absolute deafness in these cases is noteworthy in connection with Dr. Cooper's
        cure of a very chronic case of deafness with single drop doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>

        face; right teeth; right hypochondrium right chest; right upper extremity; right lower
        extremity; mouth and fauces left side. It is suited to plethoric persons with red face; and
        to conditions where there is local plethora, that is, inflammatory states with pain,
        throbbing, shiny redness as in acute gout. Symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
