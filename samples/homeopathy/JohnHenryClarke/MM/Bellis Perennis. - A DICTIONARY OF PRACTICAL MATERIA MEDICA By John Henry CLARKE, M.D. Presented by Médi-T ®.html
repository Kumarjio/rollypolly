        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Characteristics.<i>&#9472;</i></font></b>The old name of
        "Wound-wort," or "Bruise-wort," shows one of the main spheres of the
        action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellis</font></i>, and allies it in action with its
        fellow Compositæ, <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Calendula</font></i>.
        The daisy is a flower which is repeatedly trodden upon and always comes up smiling
        afterwards; and being the "day's eye" may be the sign of its too early waking
        propensities. Dr. Burnett is the chief authority for its homœopathic uses. "It acts
        very much like <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, even to the production of
        erysipelas." He has cured with its aid several cases of tumours originating in a blow.
        "Stasis" and "fag" are the principal notes of its action. Exudations and
        swellings of many kinds. Fagged womb. Varicose veins. The giddinesses of elderly people
        (cerebral stasis). It has marked action on female sexual organs, especially on engorged
        uterus and breasts. It relieves troubles of pregnancy: inability to walk; varicose veins.
        Fag from masturbation. Overworked old labourers and workmen; head sufferings of elderly
        working gardeners; commercial travellers; railway spine. Burnett has generally given it in
        the Ø tincture. It is a pre-eminently left-side medicine; causes stitches in spleen. It has
        produced acne; boils; rheumatic pains; giddiness. Headache from occiput to sinciput;
        contracted feeling in front brain. A pain in inner side of right arm as if a boil were
        developing. A leading indication is found in its causation: Ill-effects of sudden wet chill
        to heated stomach or body surface. This may be taken as a keynote: "effects of cold or
        iced drinks when heated"; dyspepsia, amenorrhœa, skin affections (including a striking
        case of psoriasis), rheumatism from this cause. Near and remote effects of blows, falls,
        accidents (trauma). It causes a tired feeling with desire to lie down. As a remedy for
        debility following acute attacks of gout Burnett gives it a very high place, classing it
        with <i><font color="#0000ff">Vanadium</font></i>, of which it is a complement in
        degenerative states, as brain softening and atheroma of arteries. It has been observed to
        cause dilatation of the pupil when used locally. It is well not to give it near bed time, as
        it is apt to cause sleeplessness, waking at 3 a.m. and conversely "waking up too early
        in the morning and cannot get to sleep again" is a leading indication for its use.</p>
