        has some very peculiar symptoms which will serve as keynotes to many cases. Chief among them
        are: (<i><font color="#0000ff">1</font></i>) Sensitiveness to sudden noises, as a distant
        shot, which causes violent starting. (It has cured "shot-shyness" in sporting
        dogs.) (<i><font color="#0000ff">2</font></i>) Intolerance of downward motions a child
        screams when nurse puts it into cot, or when she rocks it symptoms are worse going
        downstairs; sea-sickness (when the downward motion is felt most: "Every time the ship
        goes down, everything in me comes up"). Restlessness with ebullitions, especially after
        talking, with nausea. Laughter alternating with weeping. Cobweb sensations; sore mouth;
        infant pale, earthy, flesh flabby; screams out in sleep, wakes frightened and clings to
        nurse; excessively nervous, a slight noise arouses. Starts with pain. Muco-cutaneous
        surfaces are sore; in the eyelids there is ingrowing of lashes. Otorrhœa and inflammation
        of auricle: "starts with the pains." Nostrils ulcerated; soreness, pain and
        swelling of tip of nose. Aphthæ; mouth of child feels hot to mother's nipple; child lets go
        nipple and cries with pain and vexation, or else refuses breast altogether. Diarrhœa with
        pain or soft yellow stools accompanying aphthæ. Child screams before urinating (from
        inflammation of mucous membrane). Leucorrhœa clear, copious, albuminous, unnaturally hot.
        Painful nursing; pain after nursing; <i><font color="#0000ff">empty</font></i> feeling in
        breasts; they ache because they are empty, <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by
        pressure: this is characteristic. Dysmenorrhœa (may be membranous), pain excessive during
        flow. Leucorrhœa preceding and following menses, albuminous, acrid. Herpetic eruptions;
        pleuritic symptoms (upper right chest) and cough, with expectoration of a mushy, mouldy
        odour. A notable symptom is: Before the easy stool in afternoon, fretful, ill-humoured,
        indolent, and discontented; after it, lively, contented, and cheerful. Another mental
        symptom is: Idles through the afternoon does not really get to work; changes from one
        business to another from one room to another. It is suited to the period of dentition; to
        persons with light hair; lax skins and muscles; wrinkled skin consequences of getting cold
        in cold and wet weather; riding eating fruit. Symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        in warm weather, <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> after menstruation. Parts usually
        red turn white. Many <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> symptoms appear in the
        proving. Stitching pains predominate.</p>
