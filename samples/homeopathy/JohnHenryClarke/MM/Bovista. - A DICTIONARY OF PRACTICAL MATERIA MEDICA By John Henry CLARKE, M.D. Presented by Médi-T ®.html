        which, according to report, is eaten in, Italy before it is ripe, becomes filled, while
        ripening, with a blackish dust that breaks the husk which contains it, with a slight
        noise." Corresponding to this signature, "bloatedness," puffy condition of
        body surface," and a sense of "enlargement," flatulent distension and noisy
        passage of flatus, are leading features of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i>
        pathogenesis. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i> has cured cases of ovarian cyst;
        and also warts and corns, with shooting pains. There are ebullitions with great thirst. The
        corners of the mouth are broken out. Numb, pithy feeling in mouth. There is stuttering and
        stammering speech. Awkwardness, misapplies words in speaking and writing. Relaxation of
        entire capillary system; hæmorrhagic diathesis; hæmorrhage from menstrual irregularities;
        from traumatism. Menstrual flow occurring only or chiefly at night. Hæmorrhage between the
        periods. The puffy, expanding properties of the remedy are shown in a puffy condition of the
        body surface; instruments (<i><font color="#0000ff">e.g</font></i>., scissors) indent the
        fingers in an unusual degree. The heart feels enormously large. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i>
        has colic like <i><font color="#0000ff">Coloc</font></i>., causing the patient to bend
        double, but it differs from <i><font color="#0000ff">Coloc</font></i>. in that the colic is <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> by eating and is sometimes accompanied by voiding of red
        urine. M. L. Sircar has recorded a striking cure of such a case with <i><font color="#0000ff">Bov</font></i>. 3x, the pain being griping-twisting, intermittent, starting
        below umbilicus and diffusing itself towards epigastrium; some constipation; urine scanty
        and reddish. Nothing gave relief except eating. "Itching at top of coccyx" is
        another characteristic symptom. A case of cyst in broad ligament was cured, presenting these
        symptoms:<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>Metrorrhagia, flow at night or early morning, easily provoked
        from slight over-exertion during menses; can bear nothing tight round body; menses preceded
        and followed by diarrhœa; acrid corrosive leucorrhœa, flowing at night only, follows
        menses.<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>"We may always think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i>
        when we see a very "tettery" person, one who has tetters here and there, all over
        the body. These tetters may be either moist or dry" (Guernsey). Teste observed psoric
        eruptions appear on the hands and feet of a patient to whom he gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Bov</font></i>.
        for headache. He cured with it a "red, crusty eruption on thighs and bends of knees of
        eighteen years' duration. It disappeared for weeks, reappearing in hot weather and at the
        full moon. W. S. Gee cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovist</font></i>. 4, after the
        failure of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>, the following case. A widow, 55, had an
        eruption, which she thought to be erysipelas, on right foot. Some years before she had had
        an eruption on left foot, which discharged much water, and was "cured" by the use
        of a salve. A few months later the left knee became affected and the limb was amputated
        above the joint. The present eruption was fiery red, covered with yellowish-brown scales,
        thick as an old-fashioned wafer. There were also rheumatic pains in the leg. After <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> had been given without benefit, Dr. Gee elicited these
        additional symptoms: "Occasional spells of short breathing, especially from working
        with the hands. Sleep disturbed by burning and itching, and also by anxious, frightful
        dreams; headache when waking from sleep. Frequent desire to urinate, even immediately after
        urinating." These symptoms being found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovist</font></i>.
        in addition to "moist vesicular eruptions, with formation of thick crusts," the
        latter put in heavy type by Lilienthal, this medicine was given with steady improvement and
        eventual cure. Great weakness of the joints. Sensitive to touch, cannot bear clothing.
        Sensitive to draught, chilliness predominates. Early morning sweat <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        on chest. Many symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> in early morning; the
        diarrhœa occurs then. Sweat of axilla smells like onions. Symptoms generally are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> morning; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> cold food;
        <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> hot food. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b>
        Hot weather; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> at full moon. Effects of
        over-exertion. Bending double <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> colic; straightening
        up <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b> shooting pains between shoulders. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i> antidotes effects of charcoal fumes. Easily intoxicated; <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> from wine. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> From
