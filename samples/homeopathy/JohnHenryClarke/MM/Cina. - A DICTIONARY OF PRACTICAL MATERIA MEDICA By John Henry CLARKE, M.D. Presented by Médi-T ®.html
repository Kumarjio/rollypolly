        is the source of the alkaloid <i><font color="#0000ff">Santoninum</font></i>. It is
        pre-eminently a worm medicine, as it causes all the symptoms which characterise
        helminthiasis both mental, nervous, and bodily. It corresponds more to the effects of
        lumbrici than to those of other worms. There is irritation of the nose, causing constant
        desire to rub, prick, or press into it. In children there is extreme ill-humour and
        naughtiness. Nothing pleases them for any length of time; gritting teeth during sleep;
        wetting the bed (when accompanied by picking nose, great hunger, restless sleep); tossing
        all about the bed in sleep; crying out as if in delirium Sherbino has found "getting on
        hands and knees in sleep" a strong indication for it. But <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i>
        is much more than a mere worm-medicine. Many symptoms appear to be reflex from abdominal
        irritation. A characteristic feature is: Extreme sensitiveness of mind and body: offended by
        the slightest thing; peevish and obstinate; aversion to be caressed. Over-sensitiveness of
        surface: cannot endure to be approached, touched, or pressed upon; touch induces or
        aggravates spasms. Child cannot bear to have head combed or brushed. Aversion to light.
        Strabismus; with sickly look and dark circles round eyes; yellow vision. Asthenopia,
        defective accommodation; yellow vision. Ravenous hunger; sinking immediately after a meal.
        Difficult swallowing of liquids; clucking noise from throat to stomach. Nocturnal enuresis;
        urine white, turbid, at times fetid. Larynx extremely sensitive, touching it causes
        suffocative spasm. Cough excited by sensation of feather down in throat. Reflex cough;
        caused by writing or reading (to oneself). In fever there is thirst with chill; face pale
        and cold; hands warm; nausea or vomiting of bile or ingesta. Charles Mohr (<i><font color="#0000ff">H. M</font></i>., January, 1898) commends it for: anæmic persons suffering
        from indigestion and non-assimilation of food; or after acute illness when they have
        headache, vertigo, and neuralgia. In the cachectic who have pains in the belly and deranged
        abdominal functions, and suffer nervously. For asthenopia from onanism, when reading by
        artificial light is next to impossible; eyes feel veiled, need constant wiping. Spasmodic
        strabismus from abdominal irritation. Spasmodic asthma after food that disagrees,
        "sensation as if sternum lies too close to back, embarrasses breathing and causes
        anxiety and sweat." Prosopalgia of supra- and infra-orbital region and zygoma chiefly,
        pains pressing, screwing, with hyperæsthesia. Gastralgia, enteralgia, and fevers when the
        leading symptoms are present. Nash (<i><font color="#0000ff">Leaders in Typhoid Fever</font></i>)
        mentions two cases of typhoid in which Cina proved curative, the indications being
        "Intense <i><font color="#0000ff">circumscribed redness of the cheeks</font></i>, and
        frequent and <i><font color="#0000ff">violent rubbing of the nose</font></i>." S. C.
        Ghose has recorded (<i><font color="#0000ff">H. W</font></i>., September, 1899) a striking
        cure by <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> 6 and 200 of a case of infantile remittent
        fever, in which the classical symptoms of the drug were present; the fever came on very
        irregularly. The symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> are <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> night; before midnight child wakes up frightened. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> From open air; cold air; cold water. <b><font color="#0000ff">&lt;</font></b> Yawning. Child lies on belly, or on hands and knees, during
        sleep. Guernsey says <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> is suited to complaints which
        are concomitant to yawning, which come on whenever one yawns.</p>
