        precatorius</font></i> is a climbing plant, a native of India, but has been introduced to
        the Western tropics, and its use as an eye remedy was discovered by the natives of Brazil,
        who gave it the name <i><font color="#0000ff">Jequirity</font></i>. It has "small
        nearly globose seeds, which are of a brilliant scarlet colour, with a black scar indicating
        where they were attached to the pods" (<i><font color="#0000ff">Treas. of Bot</font></i>.).
        These are used for necklaces; and as a standard of weight under the name of Raté. The roots
        are used in the same manner as liquorice roots. The method of its employment in eye
        affections is as follows: Thirty-two grains of the powdered seeds are allowed to soak for
        twenty-four hours in a thousand grammes of water. The patient (with granular ophthalmia)
        bathes his eyes with the filtered product thrice daily for three days, at the end of which
        time he has become the subject of a severe conjunctivitis, which may be either purulent or
        more allied to the diphtheritic form. By the fifteenth day the inflammation ceases and the
        granulations are found to be much diminished in size or even destroyed (<i><font color="#0000ff">B. J. H</font></i>., xli. 280). The intensity of the inflammation may be
        regulated by the strength of the solution. Sometimes the inflammation does not confine
        itself to the eyes but affects the lids with an intense inflammation which spreads to the
        face, neck, and chest. Sattler propounded a theory that there was a specific bacillus in the
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Jequirity</font></i> infusion, but Klein (<i><font color="#0000ff">H.
        W</font></i>., xix. 220) and later Benson (<i><font color="#0000ff">H. W</font></i>., xix.
        286) conclusively disproved this by showing that the effect was produced equally well with
        powdered seeds, infusion freshly made and infusion in all stages of bacterial decomposition.
        In the old school <i><font color="#0000ff">Jeq</font></i>. has been used instead of
        blenorrhagic infection for the cure of granular lids. Whilst allopaths adopt this crude bit
        of Homœopathy from the Brazilian natives there is no reason why homœopaths should not use <i><font color="#0000ff">Jeq</font></i>. in the attenuations. A further use has been made of it by
        Shoemaker of Philadelphia (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lancet</font></i>, August 2, 1884-<i><font color="#0000ff">H. W</font></i>., xx. 427) in affections of the skin showing great cell
        proliferation, lupoid conditions, epithelioma, sloughing ulcers. The preparation he used was
        made as follows: Two hundred grains of the beans are decorticated by being slightly bruised
        and crushed in a mortar, the red hulls being carefully picked from the cotyledons; the
        latter are put in a bottle and covered with distilled water. They are thus macerated
        twenty-four hours, then transferred to a mortar and thoroughly triturated to a smooth paste.
        Sufficient water is then added to make the whole weigh 800 grains. Prepared in this way it
        is like an emulsion and is applied to the surface to be treated with a large camel-hair
        pencil or mop. The application of this emulsion to ulcerated surfaces is almost painless,
        but soon (often within an hour) there is much irritation and inflammation, the edges become
        red and infiltrated, surrounding tissues œdematous and shining. In the course of from six
        to twelve hours a desiccated cuirass-like crust has formed which cracks in twenty-four hours
        more, and the discharge escapes freely. This goes on for five or six days, the quantity of
        discharge diminishing. The crust then separates or is removed by water dressing and
        discloses healthy granulations. If any unhealthy granulations are left the application is
        repeated. Shoemaker says of the result of this treatment, that it exercises a destructive
        tendency on unhealthy granulated conditions followed by a constructive change, promoting
        under the protective cover of the exudation which it causes, a rapid development of healthy
        tissue. But it must be used with caution, for "it may give rise to erysipelatous
        inflammation, and if used on weak and irritable patients, to great constitutional
        disturbances." Shoemaker gives a series of striking cures with the remedy, but the
        constitutional effects are of more importance to homœopaths. They are: headache, pain in
        the limbs, fever, high pulse. In a case of ulcerative lupus of both sides of the nose which
        was cured by five applications, the first was <i><font color="#0000ff">followed by:</font></i>
        an enormous amount of inflammation, accompanied by malaise, febrile exacerbation (103° F.),
        which lasted till the crust began to dry.<b><i>&#9472;</i></b><i><font color="#0000ff">Abrus
        Precatorius</font></i> was the plant employed by Professor Nowack to determine
        meteorological and telluric forecasts owing to the extreme sensitiveness of its leaves to
        atmospheric disturbances.</p>
