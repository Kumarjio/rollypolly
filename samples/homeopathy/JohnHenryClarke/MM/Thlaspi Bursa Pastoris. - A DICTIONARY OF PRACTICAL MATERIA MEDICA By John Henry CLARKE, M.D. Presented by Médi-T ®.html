        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Characteristics.<i>&#9472;</i></font></b>"Shepherd's purse,"
        says Gerarde, "stayeth bleeding in any part of the body, whether the juice or the
        decoction thereof be drunk, or whether it be used poultice-wise, or in both, or any way
        else. In a clyster it cureth the bloody flux; it healeth green and bleeding wounds; it is
        marvellous good for inflammations new beginning and for all diseases which must be checked
        back and cooled." Gerarde adds that the decoction will stop diarrhœa, blood-spitting,
        hæmaturia, and all other fluxes of blood. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. is
        the white-man's faithful friend. "A native of Europe, it has accompanied Europeans in
        all their migrations, and established itself wherever they have settled to till the
        soil" (<i><font color="#0000ff">Treas. of Bot</font></i>.). It does not refuse to grow
        in the poorest soils, but it luxuriates in the richest. Burnett noticed that it flourished
        best in the neighbourhood of dunghills, and the odour of the tincture is much suggestive
        thereof. Some have seen in the seed-vessel the signature of the shape of the uterus, and
        Burnett found in it an organ remedy of vast importance. The Ø tincture, he said, is the
        best thing to give for menses that have been checked; for uterine hæmorrhages he preferred
        the attenuations. He has observed it cause sexual excitement like <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>.
        It aided Burnett in the cure of an inveterate case of gall-stones, the origin of which he
        traced to the uterus. Dudgeon (<i><font color="#0000ff">M. H. R</font></i>., xxxii. 614)
        reports a case which reverses this. He had treated a lady for jaundice, from which she made
        a good recovery; but there came on a peculiar discharge after the catamenial flux. It was of
        brownish-green blood and was attended with obscure abdominal pains. The cervix uteri was
        swollen and soft but not ulcerated. Dudgeon failed to cure this; but Rafinesque, of Paris,
        after trying other remedies, succeeded with <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. The
        6th had immediate good effect. Rafinesque afterwards gave the Ø and then again the 6th, and
        in a few weeks the cure was complete. Dudgeon's article on <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>.
        is the most complete we have. He quotes a case of Rademacher's showing the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. on uric acid excretion. A woman whom Rademacher had
        relieved ten years before of a large quantity of urinary sand, again presented herself; her
        abdominal cavity was full of water, extremely swollen, and she was passing urine of a light
        red colour with bloody sediment. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. Ø, 30 drops
        five times a day, was given solely with the idea of stopping the hæmaturia. But the result
        was<b><i>&#9472;</i></b>a more copious discharge of urinary sand than ever before; the urine
        increased, the dropsy disappeared, and the woman was cured. Dudgeon also quotes a case of
        Kinil's: A woman had strangury three weeks after confinement, she could not retain her
        urine, which dribbled away drop by drop. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. Ø, 30
        drops five times a day, removed the strangury at once, and in a few days the urine could be
        retained and became clear without sediment. "Dysuria of old persons, when the passing
        is painful and there is at the same time spasmodic retention of it" is an indication
        given by Heer. Dudgeon's own cases are no less striking: (<i><font color="#0000ff">1</font></i>)
        A lady, 76, had rheumatic muscular pains in various parts, and the most abundant secretion
        of uric acid, which passed away with every discharge of urine. Sometimes small calculi
        formed and then there was much pain in their passage along the ureter, but generally it
        passed in the form of coarse sand, which formed a thick layer at the bottom of the utensil.
        This sand continued to pass after the cessation of the rheumatic pains, which lasted six or
        seven weeks. <i><font color="#0000ff">Puls., Pic. ac., Lyc</font></i>. had no effect. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. 1 diminished the sand to an insignificant amount. (<i><font color="#0000ff">2</font></i>) A gentlemen, 57, in addition to other dyspeptic symptoms had
        unusually large discharges of coarse uric acid, coming away in masses as large as a big
        pin's head but without pain. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. 1 stopped this. (<i><font color="#0000ff">3</font></i>) Lady, nearly 80, was suffering from the presence of a calculus
        in left ureter. She had previously passed much sand. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>.
        1 caused a great discharge of sand and a speedy relief of her pain. Dudgeon also refers to a
        case of Harper's illustrating the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>. on
        the bowels. An elderly lady had suffered for years from a copious discharge of muco-pus,
        sometimes mixed with blood, sometimes nearly all blood, which passed from the bowels after
        each evacuation. She had been under high homœopathy, oxygen treatment, and for a long time
        under Harper himself without effect, when he gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>.
        Ø in five-drop doses and cured the case in a few days. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>.
        1x I saved a lady who had been curetted several times with small success from a further
        curetting, which was advised as being essential to the cure. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thlasp</font></i>.
        stopped the hæmorrhages, restored the periods to their proper term, and the patient
        immediately began to recover her strength, which had been drained to the last degree. There
        has been no return of the trouble. <i><font color="#0000ff">Peculiar Sensations are:</font></i>
        As of needles or shocks from a battery between end of sternum and umbilicus. As if neck and
        left shoulder would break with pain. Symptoms are <b><font color="#0000ff">&gt;</font></b>
        bending over. Hæmorrhages are profuse, periodic; blood dark, clotted. The toes are affected
        along with cramping pain in stomach.</p>
