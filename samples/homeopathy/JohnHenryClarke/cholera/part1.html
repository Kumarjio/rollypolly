        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With all our
        microscopes and experiments on living animals (which possess a natural
        immunity against cholera, and are thus peculiarly unfitted for the study
        of this disease) we have got little further than this. That there is an
        infective principle there is no doubt, and that it is of an
        infinitesimal organised nature need not be disputed. Whether it is a
        comma-shaped bacillus or a straight bacillus, or a variety of bacilli,
        may safely be left to the microbiologists to fight over.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing of vital
        importance to know is, the conditions under which the infection may be
        guarded against, and how the disease may be cured when once the
        infection has "taken." Happily each of these points is pretty

        Hahnemann was doubtless right in attributing cholera to a specific
        infection, he was perhaps unnecessarily severe on the upholders of the
        "atmospheric-telluric" theory. In all epidemics there are a
        number of factors at work&nbsp;; and it is in proportion as the
        accessory conditions are favourable that the infection spreads. It would
        be bold to deny that atmospheric and electric conditions have nothing to
        do with it. Though no quarantine may be observed, one town will escape
        whilst another is smitten, and that though both may be fed by the same
        water-supply. In India, where the disease is endemic, an outbreak in
        troops may be suddenly determined by the occurrence of a thunderstorm.
        Or the disease may-take one side of a street and spare the other, the
        fortunate side being the side exposed to the sun. In the outbreak at an
        asylum of Halle in Germany, the inmates of one wing only were affected,
        that wing having been built over the site of an old pond. Professor von
        Pettenkofer's experiments on himself at Munich go to show the same
        thing. He swallowed an enormous number of bacilli, but remained free
        from cholera&nbsp;; his contention being that the condition of locality
        was one of the determining factors, and that in Munich, which had
        remained free from the disease, although in frequent communication with
        Hamburg, this condition was wanting.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For my part, I should
        define cholera as a specific fever, due to epidemic influences not well
        understood, and more allied to intermittent than to the eruptive
        fevers&nbsp;; the chill stage of the fever being so intense that it
        overshadows all its other features.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The external chill
        being accompanied by internal congestion, which generally finds relief
        in copious evacuation by the stomach in vomiting, and by the bowels in
        diarrhœa.</p>

        there is no need to wait until the nature of cholera is thoroughly
        understood before undertaking to cure it. If there is one thing certain
        in this world, it is that thousands of lives have saved by homœopathic
        treatment in cholera epidemics that would infallibly have been lost
        under allopathy. It is a matter of the first importance to public safety
        that this fact should be made thoroughly well known wherever cholera may
        reach. The fact is attested not by homœopathists merely from their
        experience in every epidemic in which it has been put to the test, but
        by allopaths themselves who have watched the treatment and its results,
        many having been converted to homœopathy in consequence of the cures
        they have witnessed. Here is an extract from a letter written by Dr
        Macloughlin, the Medical Inspector of Stepney, Poplar, St Andrews, St
        Giles, and St George's, Bloomsbury, who undertook to watch the practice
        at the London Homœopathic Hospital during the epidemic of 1854. The
        letter was addressed to Mr Hugh Cameron, one of the surgeons to the
        Hospital at that time. Dr Macloughlin said&nbsp;:-</p>

          a friend to send a subscription to your charitable fund. And I need

        homœopathic treatment in cholera needs no stronger testimony than this.

        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a matter of
        surprise to many homœopaths that during the height of the cholera
        epidemic at Hamburg last summer nothing was heard of the treatment of
        the disease by the method of Hahnemann. It was felt that some of the

        the public advantage&nbsp;; and it now turns out that such was indeed
        the case, but the work was done so quietly and unostentatiously that the

        of cholera was also very common, reminding us of the old story of the
        plague and the philosopher at Damascus. As the plague was entering the
        city he met a philosopher, and informed him that he had 3000 victims to
        carry off. As it happened, 6000 died, whereupon the sage expostulated
        with the demon of the epidemic&nbsp;: "You said you had only </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">three</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        thousand victims, and you have taken </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">six</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">."
        "Oh&nbsp;! no," was the reply, "I only killed 3000&nbsp;;
        </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">fear</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        killed the rest." Perhaps if he had wished to be quite exact he
        might have credited a few of the victims to the Damascus doctors.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is not the
        slightest doubt that fear is a potent factor in the causation of
        disease. It is the most depressing of all emotions, and greatly lessens
        the resisting-power of the organism. In the Hamburg cases Dr Hesse found
        </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        a specific when the fear of cholera was the leading element in the case.

        I published an extract from one of the medical journals in which a
        practitioner related a case of copper poisoning which was almost
        indistinguishable from a case of Asiatic cholera. This property of
        copper to produce symptoms exceedingly like those of cholera renders it
        one of the most valuable medicines in the treatment of the disease. But,
        more than that, it has also proved the very best preventive.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some of the

        researches, twenty-five years previously, which proved to him the
        immunity from cholera possessed by workers in copper, and said that
        where the question had been investigated by other observers, the same
        result had been arrived at. He also traced the preservation of Aubagne,
        between Toulon and Marseille, through every epidemic of cholera, to the
        fact that the large quantity of copper employed in the potteries
        surrounding the city produced, as it were, a rampart of copper-laden

        custom of wearing rings of copper on the toes followed by some of the
        natives of India may have some (conscious or unconscious) connection
        with its power of affording protection against this disease.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Europeans in India wear
        round the waist a double band of flannel, which they call a cholera belt&nbsp;;
        and doubtless the magnetic properties of flannel may increase the bodily
        resisting power. But these belts have been improved upon, and the
        protection rendered much more certain by the addition to the flannel of
        a plate copper, two to four inches in diameter. Such belts are to be
        procured of all homœopathic chemists&nbsp;; or they may be improvised
        by procuring pieces of thin copper plate, cutting in them slits at
        opposite borders, to which straps or tapes may be attached, which may be
        passed and fastened round the body. The cholera belt should be worn
        night and day. It may be cleansed from time to time by rubbing with a
        little vinegar. If copper in this form is objected to, the homœopathic
        preparation of </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Cuprum

        doubt about the ordinary service water. Care must be taken to avoid all
        excesses in eating and drinking, and especially eating fruit that is not
        perfectly sound and good. Clothing should be sufficient and warm.
        Especial caution should be observed in leaving off garments in warm
        weather, and in avoiding getting the feet wet. Those who take these

        recommended his patients to dust sulphur inside their stockings every
        morning when they put them on. In that particular epidemic sulphur
        corresponded to the symptoms of many of the cases, and would thus be

        of cholera come on with fearful suddenness, there are generally some
        scarcely noticed signs of the presence of its poison before the attack
        develops. The "germs" are there, but they are waiting for some
        favourable condition to give them their chance&nbsp;; chilly feelings,
        griping pains, malaise, loss of appetite, slight diarrhœa, are all
        indications that the enemy is present, and ready to burst out if the
        patient'' vitality is in any way lowered by exposure to cold or damp,
        prolonged fasting, or fatigue, or loss of sleep. If, now, </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">

        pilules, taken every quarter or half an hour till all symptoms cease,

        be tested by the hand of the patient is in a state of insensibility, a
        burn may be caused without his being able to make a sign. When
        perspiration has once been induced, great care must be taken to maintain

        rush of an epidemic, cannot always attend at once, precious time may be
        lost before he can reach the patient. This time must be utilised by the
        friends, and then he will find his work greatly simplified on his
        arrival. Under no circumstances must patients be allowed to have
        opiates, or to have salt solutions injected into their veins. The
