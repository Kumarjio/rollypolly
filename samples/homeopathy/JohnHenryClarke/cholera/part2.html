        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While in cold climates
        and winter weather the chief organs to suffer from atmospheric
        conditions are those of the chest, in hot climates and in summer the
        abdominal organs are mainly affected. Many persons naturally, when they
        take cold, instead of suffering from cold in the head or cough, have
        diarrhœa&nbsp;; and in hot weather this is the more common result.
        Diarrhœa is, in fact, a catarrh of the intestinal mucous membrane, just
        as an ordinary cold is a catarrh of the mucous membrane of the nose.
        Children are more especially liable to suffer in this way. Even without
        any appreciable chill, an intensely high temperature is of itself
        sufficient to bring about a choleraic condition. All who have had the
        experience of voyaging through the tropics with very young children are
        aware of the risks they run in the confined spaces of ship's cabins, or
        the "tween decks" allotted to emigrants. In large cities a
        leading item in the summer bill of mortality is the diarrhœa of
        infants, or "cholera infantum", as it is called&nbsp;; there
        are also a considerable number of deaths among adults from
        "choleraic diarrhœa", "sporadic cholera",
        "English cholera", or "cholerine", by all of which
        names the disorder has been called.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late years there has
        been considerable dispute as to whether there is any essential
        difference between Asiatic or epidemic cholera and the fatal diarrhœa
        which is always with us in summer time. The dispute is not settled yet.
        In all probability there is a specific difference, though all attempts
        to find a single specific germ of Asiatic cholera have hitherto failed&nbsp;;
        the so-called "cholera bacillus", the comma bacillus of Koch,
        not being found in all cases of true cholera, and a bacillus
        indistinguishable from it in microscopic characters being also found in
        English cholera.</p>

        <font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A disease answering to
        the description of cholera has been known from the time of Hippocrates,
        but there is no record of epidemics of the disease having occurred. It
        is not </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">known</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        to have spread throughout Hindustan before the year 1817, though it has
        existed there for centuries. The first invasion of Europe occurred in
        1829. It came by way of Persia and Russia, and spread over the greater
        part of America. In 1845-46 it again visited Europe, reaching America in
        1848. In 1853-54 it was exceedingly fatal in Europe, and again in 1866.
        The word cholera means "bilious", and is the term used by
        Hippocrates and his contemporaries to designate the choleraic disease
        known to them, which was probably identical with our own summer diarrhœa,
        and which they attributed to disorder of the liver.</font></p>
        <font face="Garamond" size="4">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever the actual
        relationship between Asiatic cholera and summer diarrhœa may be,
        extreme cases of the latter are indistinguishable from cases of the
        former. There is the same sudden collapse of strength, evacuation of
        great quantities of serous fluid by the stomach and bowels - vomiting
        and diarrhœa - with shrivelling of the tissues in consequence of the
        liquid drain&nbsp;; violent internal pins, cramps in abdominal muscles
        and in the limbs, with coldness and cold sweat on the forehead.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In children the onset
        of the symptoms is usually sudden, though there may be indefinite
        symptoms of illness for a day or two preceding, such as a pinched look
        about the features and dark circles round the eyes. The first actual
        symptom of the attack is generally vomiting of unaltered or cheesy milk
        soon after a meal&nbsp;; this is generally followed by the passage of
        some greenish-yellow fluid containing flakes, and often undigested
        lumps.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is thirst,
        restlessness, crying, and drawing up of the legs. The tissues become
        drained of fluid&nbsp;; if the openings in the skull have not yet closed
        they will be found depressed&nbsp;; and if the progress of the disease
        is not arrested, twitchings occur in various parts, and finally
        convulsions and death.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a picture of
        what occurs in typical cases, but there are all varieties and degrees of
        the complaint short of this extreme, just as in a cholera epidemic there
        are many persons who have bowel disorder which does not develop into
        actual cholera. The probability is that these persons are not fully
        susceptible to the disease, and consequently they only have it in a
        modified form.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the determining
        causes of an attack of summer diarrhœa a prolonged spell of hot weather
        must have the first place. Next comes a sudden change from hot to cooler
        weather, and in the same category may be put any kind of chill or
        wetting. Close, overcrowded dwellings are a prolific source of the
        disease among the poor.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Errors in diet are
        answerable for many cases. A copious draught of cold water when
        overheated may bring on an attack&nbsp;; or eating fruit, and especially
        stone fruit, when not quite ripe, or when over-ripe. Fish, when there is
        the faintest suspicion of its not being fresh, is a dangerous food, and
        of all fish mackerel is the most dangerous. Even when fresh, mackerel
        will induce an attack with many people.</p>
        <p align="center"><img border="0" src="./part2_files/cholera3.gif" width="233" height="310"></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The most potent
        dietetic cause of summer diarrhœa in infants is artificial feeding, as
        it is very difficult in hot weather to keep milk from turning sour and
        keep bottles and tubes free from the germs of putrefaction. Unless
        special pains are taken about these matters, babies may be poisoned with
        their food. The practice of giving infants all kinds of ordinary food,
        "anything that is going", as the people say, must also be
        mentioned as one of the causes of child's cholera.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The epidemic of
        influenza - of which we are, as yet, not by any means clear - has been
        responsible for many cases of diarrhœa, some of them attended with
        choleraic symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the autumn of 1891 I
        was asked to see a young unmarried lady of very delicate constitution,
        spare and very active, who in her early years, passed in Australia, had
        been very subject to diarrhœa, and in whom the tendency had returned
        during the same year, 1891. She had also had typhoid fever some years
        before, which had still further tended to weaken the bowels. The
        occasion of my seeing her was an attack of influenza with failure of
        strength, depression, headache, fever, yellow tongue, oppression and
        tenderness at epigastrium, vomiting, increase in size of liver and
        spleen, with stitches in the spleen, and violent diarrhœa of light
        watery stools, accompanied with great pain in the back.</p>
        </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">

        30 in a few hours completely changed the aspect of the case, and after a
        little further treatment she became better than she had been for months
        previously.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same medicine was
        the chief agent in changing the course of events in another and much
        more dangerous case of influenza in an elderly lady, who suffered from
        valvular disease of the heart. She had high fever, diarrhœa and
        sickness, intense breathlessness and attacks of heart failure. As she
        was living away from London at the time, an old school practitioner had
        been called in, and the medicines he gave for the heart had the effect
        of intensifying ten-fold the gastric symptoms.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At last she could
        retain nothing in her stomach - neither his medicine nor nourishment. I
        was written to about her, and sent a few doses of </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">,
        which stopped the sickness and arrested the diarrhœa. She was able to
        take nourishment again, and gradually revived. But the convalescence was
        tedious.</font></p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An acute attack of
        diarrhœa, or of Asiatic cholera, may, if improperly treated, leave
        behind it a chronic state of looseness of the bowels in those who are
        predisposed. Sometimes there is a constitutional tendency to looseness,
        and then a chronic diarrhœa may supervene without any acute attack. In
        these cases any rapid stopping of the diarrhœa by astringent remedies
        is attended with no little risk&nbsp;: the diarrhœa may be cured and
        the patient made worse. With the specific homœopathic remedies the case
        is different. Their aim is to cure the </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">patient</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;:
        the diarrhœa will then no longer exist. It not unfrequently happens
        that asthma and diarrhœa alternate, - that is a patient has asthma when
        he has not diarrhœa, and diarrhœa when he has not asthma. In such
        cases, if the homœopathic remedy for the patient is found - probably </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        or </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Carbo
        vegetabilis</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4"> - the patient will
        be cured, and he will have neither complaint. He has not two diseases,
        but only one with two different expressions&nbsp;; and the allopathic
        method of "curing" the diarrhœa with "astringents",
        and the asthma with "anti-spasmodics", only keeps the see-saw
        going. Diarrhœa may be due to defect of any part of the intestinal
        tract, or of the glands which pour their secretions into it. Liver
        disease is a frequent cause of diarrhœa.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is a case in
        point. A good many years ago a patient, a gardener, aged about 50, came
        under my care in the Homœopathic Hospital suffering from recurrent
        attacks of diarrhœa with violent abdominal pains swelling in the region
        of the gall-bladder. He had been the round of the various hospitals,
        both in the county and in London, and had been under the treatment of a
        well-known practitioner, who had painted him vigorously with iodine, but
        all without benefit to the patient. For many days he would be in great
        pain, chiefly in the region of the gall-bladder, where a swelling was to
        be felt. This generally increased in size until, the pains coming to a
        climax, he would by seized with an attack of diarrhœa, the stools being
        mainly composed of matter and blood, and the swelling would disappear
        for the time. The continued suffering and drain occasioned by this
        malady had reduced the patient to a shadow of his former self&nbsp;; and
        I confess I had not much expectation of doing him great good. However,
        after trying a number of remedies, I was led by the general symptoms to
        give him </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        in alternation with </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">,
        and under these two remedies he steadily gained ground, and eventually
        became perfectly well, and has remained well ever since. He pays me a
        visit now whenever he comes to town, just to show himself, and tell me
        how many hours a day he can work, and how many miles (from 14 to 20) he
        sometimes can walk. I have little doubt that </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        had a greater share in the cure than </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">,
        as I had given him </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        before&nbsp;; and </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        has a very marked action on the gall-bladder.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many Europeans who have
        been resident in India are subject to chronic forms of diarrhœa. One
        form, called </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">adipose
        diarrhœa</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">, attended with white
        milky evacuations, is connected with disorder of the pancreas. For this,
        </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        is the most important remedy. It may be given in potencies from the 3rd

        adults the dietary suitable for an attack of English cholera is the same
        as that for the Asiatic kind. That is to say, during the first hours
        nothing but plain water need be given. If there is much collapse it
        should be given hot but if there is not it must be taken cold. Only
        small quantities should be given at a time. When the acuteness of the
        attack is over, milk and soda-water, Whey Koumiss No. 3, or infants'
        foods may be given until the powers of digestion renew themselves.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All soups and beef-teas
        should be avoided, as they have a relaxing tendency. The addition of
        isinglass, however, helps to correct their relaxing properties, and in
        cases of great exhaustion they may be given with this added. They are
        better given cold, in the jelly form, one or two teaspoonfuls at a time.
        All hot drinks excite the action of the bowels. During consequence
        mutton broth or chicken-tea may be given, and beef-tea when the
        looseness has entirely passed away. Plain water arrowroot with a
        teaspoonful of brandy in it has binding properties&nbsp;; and </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">white
        of egg</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4"> beaten up into a froth,
        and slightly flavoured with lemon and sweetened with a little loaf
        sugar, is a most excellent form of nourishment in cases of diarrhœa.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of children
        no definite line of treatment can be laid down. If one kind of food does
        not suit a particular child, another must be tried. Carnrick's,
        Mellin's, Allen and Hanburys', Nestlé's, are all good, and may be tired
        when breast milk or cow's milk is not tolerated. A very useful
        substitute for breast milk is the Aylesbury Dairy Co.'s Artificial Human
        Milk, which I have known to agree when all other kinds have failed. But
        it must not be forgotten that a child will take no harm if it goes
        without all food for 12 hours or more, and is given only water. In many
        cases of infant cholera the frequent administration of teaspoonfuls of
        water is the very best "food" the patient can have, until the
        signs of irritation have subsided.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of no less importance
        than the question of diet is that of air. Plenty of fresh air is an
        essential requisite. An airy room that is exposed to sunlight during
        some part of the day is one of the best aids to recovery either of the
        infant or the adult. If there is great coldness, warmth must be supplied
        by means of hot bottles and hot flannels. The clothing must be warm but
        not heavy, and woollen materials are the best. Absolute rest in the
        recumbent position in necessary in all cases.</p>

        number of cases in which there is intolerance of milk. Here is a typical
        case. A short time ago I was asked to see an infant girl. 7 weeks old,
        suffering from diarrhœa. The history given me was that she had suffered
        from wind since her birth, and had been crying all the time, more or
        less, both night and day. An allopathic practitioner who had attended
        the mother on her confinement had been unable to do anything for the
        child, and the parents decided to try a change of treatment.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The child was very thin&nbsp;;
        nothing would stay in its stomach&nbsp;; milk was vomited curled almost
        as soon as taken. The navel was protruded with constant crying, and
        sore. There was irritating diarrhœa, the stools being light, and the
        water was strong and offensive. With the attack of diarrhœa there were
        convulsive movements, and drawing up of the legs. She screamed
        incessantly every night from 12 to 3 A. M. I prescribed </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Æthus.

        and that night was the first quiet night she had since her birth. There
        was no more vomiting, and very little diarrhœa. Only three screaming
        attacks in the 24 hours, and these not severe ones. Subsequently the
        screaming became rather worse&nbsp;; the child could not be pacified
        unless carried, and there was some intertrigo or "chafing",
        though the vomiting and diarrhœa had not returned. </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
