        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4"><img alt="Dr John Henry CLARKE" src="./preface_files/clarke02.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="189" height="183">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LIKE
        most generalisations, the old saying "A little knowledge is a
        dangerous thing" contains quite as much of error as it does of
        truth&nbsp;; and if anything were needed to prove it, the experiences of
        lay homœopathists in the various cholera epidemics would be amply
        sufficient. In view of a possible return of cholera, it has seemed
        desirable to reprint with amplifications an article which appeared in
        the </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Homœopathic
        World</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4"> of may last, entitled
        "What to do if Cholera comes", that the lay public may have
        within reach all the knowledge that is necessary to enable them to deal
        with any case of cholera that may occur in their midst in the absence of
        a medical man. Cholera is a disease that needs treatment at the very
        first onset, and if the treatment is not forthcoming, the patient may
        die before a doctor can be procured. It is analogous in this respect to
        cases of drowning or rupture of varicose veins&nbsp;; anybody on the
        spot who has coolness and intelligence is bound to do what can be done
        without waiting for a doctor's arrival. It is therefore of supreme
        importance that all "First Aid" graduates, and, indeed, all
        who hold responsible positions as employers or guardians of others,
        should know what homœopathy has done and can do with such a scourge as
        cholera, that they may apply it at once should the emergency arise.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4"><img alt="Alfred Crosby POPE, M.D., M.R.C.S." src="./preface_files/crosbypo.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="192" height="327">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That
        I may give a concrete instance of the value of lay homœopathy in a
        cholera epidemic I will quote a passage from Tract 42 of the
        Homœopathic League Series, adapted from an article on "The
        Cholera", by Dr. Pope, in the </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Homœopathic
        Review</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4"> of October 1892.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The epidemic
        which prevailed at the East End of London in 1866 furnished abundant
        evidence of the power of </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        to control the early symptoms of cholera.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As it is at the very
        commencement of the illness that </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        is useful, its administration is, necessarily more or less domestic&nbsp;;
        the second stage generally reached ere a medical adviser is called in,
        and then </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        is of little service. Hence it is rather to clergymen, missionaries and
        district visitors, who during an epidemic are constantly in and out of
        the houses of the poor, whether ill or well, than to medical men, that
        we have to look for evidence of its value.</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In an interesting
        and instructive account of the mission work accomplished by the late
        Rev. C. F. Lowder, of St Peter's, London Dock, during the epidemic of
        1866, when alluding to the tincture of camphor the author writes. - '
        When this was used in time, on the very first symptoms of the attack, it
        seldom failed to arrest the disease&nbsp;; of this we had numberless
        proofs, as there was no difficulty in giving it at once before the
        medical man was able to attend the case.'</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr Lewis, a gentleman
        who devoted his time to visiting among the poor in Spitalfields,
        distributed among them several thousands of small bottles of tincture of
        camphor, together with printed directions for its use. When doing so, Mr
        Lewis took the name and address of every applicant, and subsequently
        visited him. "Wherever", he writes, 'it has been resorted to
        early, it has been successful'.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Garamond" size="4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Miss Lowe, a lady
        who went to reside in a cholera-stricken district for the purpose of
        ministering to the wants of the poor, wrote&nbsp;: - 'I have to express
        the deepest gratitude to Mr Lewis for his invaluable gift of </font><i><font face="Garamond" size="4" color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i><font face="Garamond" size="4">.
        He has supplied me abundantly, and I feel that there is no remedy like
        it, when taken in time. The Bible-woman, labouring in Holywell Lane
        district under Mrs Ranyard, has also been supplied, as a free gift by Mr
        Lewis, and can testify to many wonderful instances of its power.' "</font></p><font face="Garamond" size="4">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In issuing this reprint
        it has seemed to me that I might enhance its value by adding a chapter
        on English cholera and ordinary diarrhœa, and another on dysentery.</p>
