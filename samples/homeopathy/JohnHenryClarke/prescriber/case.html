        <p align="JUSTIFY">1. A SUGGESTED FORM.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr John Henry CLARKE" src="./case_files/clarke03.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="129" height="191">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first step towards making
        a good prescription is a well-taken case. The homœopathist takes his
        cases with much more care than do others&nbsp;; for he has a double
        diagnosis to make-the diagnosis of the disease and the diagnosis of the
        remedy. The directions given by Hahnemann himself in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i> should be carefully studied, and the
        spirit of them followed. The patient should be allowed to tell his own
        story, stating just what he <i><font color="#0000ff">feels</font></i>,
        and the particular symptoms he is most anxious to be rid of.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I once had a compliment
        paid to me by a patient in Hahnemann ward when I was a resident
        physician in the hospital. It was paid indirectly and was all the more
        valuable for that. It was contained in a remark made to another patient
        and over-heard by one of the nurses. The speaker was telling his
        neighbour why he approved of my methods. It was not because I had cured
        him, for he had not been in hospital long enough for that&nbsp;; it was
        because, as he put it, "<i><font color="#0000ff">He lets you have
        your say</font></i>."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, I take it, is the
        foundation on which a true picture of a case has to be constructed in
        the doctor's mind -the patient's own uninterrupted story of that which
        he experiences. It is very far from being the whole of the picture, for
        if the doctor cannot see much more than the patient can tell him, he is
        not much of a doctor. But the patient's story provides not only the
        foundation, but also the outline which the imagination of the physician
        must fill in. It is on this power of correctly filling in the lines and
        the colours of a case that success in the art of the physician largely
        depends. When the patient has finished his story then comes the
        physician's turn. By his questions he elicits the particulars of the
        patient's past history, his family history, and the cause of his trouble
        if ascertainable, and he completes the picture by such items as he is
        able to obtain by physical examination.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having elicited the
        evidence, subjective, objective and inferential, the next question
        is-how is he to preserve the record&nbsp;? In this matter, every
        practitioner is a law to himself. Some have copious and accurate
        memories and are able to hold the picture complete in all its details in
        their own minds. I am not one of these. For me it is a necessity to get
        all the chief points on written record, so that, without burdening my
        memory, I can quickly restore the mental picture at any future time, by
        a reference to my notes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./case_files/hahnem159.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="126" height="139">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my own
        practice I have found of great service in taking cases detached printed
        forms such as I here append. The headings of the Hahnemannian Schema are
        spaced out, and under each I put the symptoms as told me by the patient,
        or as ascertained in examination. As the Schema form is the only form in
        which a comprehensive knowledge of a remedy can be retained in the
        memory, so it is most useful to get the facts and symptoms of a
        patient's case likewise into Schema form for purposes of comparison. The
        points of resemblance at once occur to the practitioner who has his
        knowledge in orderly shape. For it is of vital importance to have our
        knowledge in proper form&nbsp;; otherwise the unorganised part of it
        only hampers us in the use of the little we have made our own. And we
        cannot rightly claim to possess any knowledge that we have not
        incorporated with our mental organism.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For recording the
        subsequent progress of a case I have blank papers of the same size as
        the printed forms. I have them made of the thinnest notepaper, so that
        they occupy very little space in my pocket book. Any stationer will
        supply both the printed forms and the blank papers.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is simply for
        convenience of reference that I use this form to enter the symptoms in.
        I do not elicit them in that shape-I take them in their natural order as
        they come. The schema is the index of the case, but the body of the case
        is the picture in your own imagination. For the continuation of the case
        blank slips are used into which the initial slip fits, and these can be
        added to indefinitely. In my desk are drawers which hold these slips,
        and these are arranged in alphabetical order. The four following pages
        indicate the form I mean.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For cases taken at the
        bedside I adopt the same plan. At first I used to memorise and write the
        cases up later at home.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">- Complaint and History.
          <br>- Generalities.
          <br>- Mind.
          <br>- Head.

        </blockquote>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I found that too
        troublesome and too great a strain on my memory. I always like to save
        myself trouble, as most of my friends know, and by dotting down the
        items at the bedside in the records which I carry in my pocket case I
        save both trouble and time. Thus far the mechanical part of the process.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having got your case
        taken and entered, what are you going to do with it&nbsp;? "Cure
        it," you say. Certainly&nbsp;; but there is something more to be
        done before you can get to work on that. The case must be digested in
        your own mind. If you can put a satisfactory label on it, by all means
        do so. But that is not sufficient in itself.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every new case we take
        on is a new world we enter&nbsp;; and for the time being we must
        identify ourselves with it, if we are to alter it for the better.</p>

        <b><font size="4" color="#000080">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">2. "TOTALITY OF THE SYMPTOMS" AND THE
        INVISIBLE NATURE OF DISEASE.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the
        technicalities of Homœopathy is the phrase "Totality of the
        symptoms." There is nothing mysterious or sacred about the phrase,
        but Hahnemann rightly said that this "totality," -that is, the
        sum total of the sensations and observable changes in the organism-
        constitutes the concrete problem in every case with which we have to
        deal, no matter what name the academicals may give to it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disease, we must never
        forget, is, in Hahnemann's conception, an INVISIBLE thing. It is a
        derangement of the INVISIBLE VITAL FORCE. To use a modern simile, the
        symptoms constitute a moving picture like the figures on the screen of a
        cinema. The visible and tangible part of the human body is the screen&nbsp;;
        the appearances and sensations of the diseased vital force are the
        "symptoms" and are analogous to the moving figures&nbsp;; but
        the operators producing the appearances are hidden from the audience.
        All the same, it is by looking on the screen that you can read the story
        of the changes in the invisible life-force in a way you could not do by
        going behind the screen. "Hence the totality of the symptoms"
        constitutes the disease <i><font color="#0000ff">as our senses apprehend
        it</font></i>. The academic name we give to it is a secondary matter. As
        Hahnemann once said to a patient who asked him what his disease was, and
        what he was going to give him, -"The name of your disease is no
        concern of mine, and the name of the medicine I give is no concern of
        yours." The totality of the signs, pains and sensations is for
        practical purposes the concrete problem, and the less we trouble about
        the film and the light, the more clearly shall we be able to follow the
        story and discern our actual task.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="3"></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <b><font size="4" color="#000080">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">3. "TREATING SYMPTOMS." HAHNEMANN'S CASE.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the many absurd
        objections which Hahnemann had to meet and which his followers still
        have to meet is that Homœopathy "only treats symptoms and if it
        gets rid of them it leaves the disease untouched." The very
        opposite is the truth. Homœopathy is compelled to extinguish the
        internal, morbid action before it can cause the external symptoms to
        vanish. The Allopathic method is to get rid of the symptoms even at the
        cost off producing other and worse symptoms. The outward and visible
        signs and symptoms are the guides to the internal and invisible causes
        -that is all.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img height="322" alt="Dr Richard HUGHES" src="./case_files/hughes01.jpg" width="200" align="left" hspace="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
        are a number of ways in which the totality may be dealt with when once
        we have got it. The way Hahnemann favoured was to write out the symptoms
        in a string, affix to each the remedies which are credited in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Materia Medica</font></i> and repertories with having
        produced it, and then, having selected the one which corresponds to the
        greatest number of symptoms, giving it to the patient.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann published
        very few of his own cases, because, as he explained, he did not wish to
        give his pupils an excuse for treating cases by the names of the
        complaints, such as Nux for indigestion, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
        for rheumatism, and so on. Each case was to be treated on its own
        merits, whatever its name.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot do better than
        quote one of Hahnemann's own cases reported by himself, and this I will
        do in a few moments. It will show the double-action process which takes
        place in the homœopath's mind when taking a case.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img height="259" alt="Dr Margaret Lucy TYLER (1857-1943)" src="./case_files/tylerm02.jpg" width="180" align="right" hspace="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whilst
        what I have termed the film of the disease cinema symptom-complex by
        being unrolled before the doctor's mind's eye when taking a case, this
        picture automatically unrolls other picture-films stored up in the
        doctor's mental theatre. These are the records of the medicinal diseases
        set forth in our materia medicas. Every person who pretends to practise
        homœopathy must have his mental world stored with plenty of these.
        There is nothing but hard work and constant observation which will
        effect this, and best of all personal experiences. That was how
        Hahnemann learned his. It is essential to get into our minds the
        striking and clear-cut characteristics of a number of remedies indelibly
        engraved on our memories. As examples, I may mention the admirable
        series of "Drug Pictures" drawn by Dr. Margaret Tyler and
        published in our journals, the drug pictures of Dr. Hughes' <i><font color="#0000ff">Pharmacodynamics</font></i>, of Kent's <i><font color="#0000ff">Lectures</font></i>, and the introductory parts of the
        articles in my <i><font color="#0000ff">Materia Medica</font></i>. With
        a mind well-furnished with an extensive gallery of this kind, the
        reeling off of a patient's symptom-film will inevitably and without any
        effort, call up the materia medica pictures which correspond to them,
        and for the most part the proper remedy <a href="http://will.be/">will
        be</a> picked out almost automatically. If the mental picture-gallery is
        too scanty, or if the details of the picture are not sufficiently clear,
        there is the Repertory and the printed <i><font color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i> for reference and these must always be accessible in
        case of need.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann's picture
        gallery was bitten in, as I have explained, with his own experiences. He
        had "proved" or tested most of the instruments which he used
        on his own person, and he took doses for this purpose which were by no
        means small or highly diluted.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now I will give you his
        case which will be found recorded on p. 91 of my <i><font color="#0000ff">Homœopathy Explained</font></i>.</p>

        "gastralgia," "biliousness," or by any other name
        you are not advanced one bit on the path of cure. But what happened in
        Hahnemann's mind on the unrolling of this film&nbsp;? It immediately
        started the unrolling of several corresponding materia medica films. And
        this is how Hahnemann tells the story of them&nbsp;:</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now as regards Symptom
        1, <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus
        toxicodendron</font></i> cause shooting in the pit of the stomach on
        making a false step, but none of them <i><font color="#0000ff">only on
        movement</font></i>, as is the case here. <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        certainly causes shooting in the pit of the stomach on making a false
        step, but only as a rare alternating action, and has neither the same
        digestive derangements as occur here at 4, compared with 5 and 6, nor
        the same state of the disposition.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryonia</font></i>
        alone has among its chief alternating actions, as the whole list of its
        symptoms demonstrates, pain <i><font color="#0000ff">from movement</font></i>,
        and especially shooting pains, as also stitches beneath the sternum (in
        the pit of the stomach) on raising the arm, and on making a false step
        it causes shooting in other parts.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The negative symptom 2
        met with here answers especially to <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>&nbsp;;
        few medicines (with the exception, perhaps, of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
        vomica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i>
        in their alternating action-neith-or of which, however, is suitable for
        the other symptoms) show a complete relief to pains during rest and when
        lying&nbsp;; <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> does, however,
        in an especial manner.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptom 3 is met with
        in several medicines, and also in <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Symptom 4 is certainly
        as far as regards sickness after eating, met with in several other
        medicines (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>),
        but neither so constantly and commonly, nor with relish for food, as in <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As regards symptom 5,
        several medicines certainly cause a flow of water like water-brash, just
        as well as <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>&nbsp;; the
        others, however, do not produce symptoms similar to the remaining ones.
        Hence <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> is to be preferred to
        them in this particular.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Empty eructation (of
        wind only) after eating (symptom 6) is found in few medicines, and in
        none so constantly, so commonly and to such a degree, as in <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To 7, one of the chief
        symptoms in diseases (see <i><font color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i>,
        sec. 213) is the "state of the disposition," and as <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> causes this symptom also in an
        exactly similar manner, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> is
        for all these reasons to be preferred in this case to all other
        medicines as the homœopathic remedy."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much for the
        selection of the remedy. Here we see an admirable display of Hahnemann's
        mind at work. As he elicited the symptoms one by one, the
        "films" of all the medicines he names began to unroll
        themselves in his mind, and the <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
        film fitted much more closely to the case than Any of the others. Though
        much space is required to tell the story, the action in Hahnemann's mind
        was almost instantaneous.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now let us have the
        dosage of the remedy given and the sequel. Hahnemann says&nbsp;:-</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Now as this woman
        was very robust, and the force of the disease must consequently have
        been very considerable to prevent her, on account of the pain, doing any
        work&nbsp;; and as her vital powers, as stated, were not impaired, I
        gave her one of the strongest homœopathic doses, a full drop of the
        undiluted juice of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> root to
        be taken immediately, and bade her come to me again in forty-eight
        hours. I told my friend E., who was present, that within that time the
        woman would assuredly be quite cured&nbsp;; but he, being but half
        converted to homœopathy, expressed his doubts about it Five days
        afterwards he came again to learn the result, but the woman did not
        return then and, in fact, never came back again. I could only allay the
        impatience of my friend by telling him her name and that of the village
        where she lived, about a mile-and-a-half off, and advising him to seek
        her out and ascertain for himself how she was. This he did and her
        answer was&nbsp;: 'What was the use of my going back&nbsp;? The very
        next day I was quite well, as I am still. I am extremely obliged to the
        doctor, but the like of us have no time to leave off our work&nbsp;; and
        for three weeks previously my Illness prevented me earning
        anything.'"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here most assuredly the
        academic name of the disease was nothing to the prescriber, and the name
        of the medicine nothing to the patient. But Hahnemann found the
        substance into which Nature had packed the vibrations corresponding to
        the vibrations of the disease, and the former vanquished the latter. The
        undiluted juice of the root was given, and that must be something
        stronger than the mother tincture, as it does not appear to have had any
        alcohol mixed with it. But a cm. potency could not have acted more
        effectually.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As I have said above,
        Hahnemann's "medicine-films" had to a large extent been
        created by his own experiments on himself. It looks a very simple matter
        for anybody to swallow a drachm of the Ø (or mother tincture) of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and to experience a great many pains
        and aches in consequence. Truly this is quite easy. But to observe all
        then sensations accurately, depict them clearly in all their true
        characteristics and arrange them so that they may be available for use
        by all succeeding generations-to conceive of the possibility of doing
        this, and to execute the work, demanded genius of the very highest
        order, a supreme artist as well as a master in all that goes to make up
        medical science. That the world of general medicine does not yet know
        Hahnemann is by no means wonderful. He is still far and away beyond
        their range and reach.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case we have an
        illustration of the classical method of practising homœopathy. It
        contains the essence of all homœopathic medication. But Hahnemann
        himself discovered a way of shortening the labour. He observed that
        certain symptoms and certain combinations of symptoms, were of much
        greater value than others from a prescribing point of view. If these
        cropped up in any case and had their correspondence in symptoms
        occurring in the provings of remedies, the remedy was easily found. This
        suggestion was developed by Drs. Henry N. Guernsey and Adolph Lippe in
        America, and by David Wilson, Thomas Skinner and others in England, to
        an extent that has proved very valuable.</p>
        <p align="center"><img height="239" alt="Dr Henry Newell GUERNSEY (1817-1885)" src="./case_files/guerns02.jpg" width="150" border="0"> <img height="240" alt="Comte Adolph von zur LIPPE (1812-1888)" src="./case_files/lippea06.gif" width="173" border="0"> <img height="241" alt="Dr Thomas SKINNER (1825-1906)" src="./case_files/skinne02.jpg" width="202"></p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that when we come to
        digest a case, as I term it, in our own minds, we are always on the
        look-out for the most peculiar, and, it may be, most absurd symptoms
        which often contain the entire solution of the mystery we are trying to
        solve. If a patient says to me "There is one thing I hardly like to
        tell you, doctor," I don't rest till I get that very
        "thing" out of him-or her. A patient who consulted me recently
        had a quite amazing collection of symptoms, but it was not until she
        confided to me that her greatest trouble was the thoughts that came into
        her mind unbidden of a blasphemous order, that I was able to find the
        solution for the chief of her troubles in <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A symptom of this kind
        would be nothing more than an absurdity to an allopath, but to the homœopath
        it is the greatest value and means to the patient all the difference
        between suffering and relief, and even between life and death.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus it will be seen
        that the taking of the case is not by any means a purely mechanical
        affair, or a mere matter of counting symptoms, although the mechanical
        method is not to be discarded or neglected.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="4"></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <b><font size="4" color="#000080">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">4. INDICATIONS FROM HEREDITY AND HISTORY.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, in the process
        of "digesting" our case, there is the question of heredity,
        and of the possible presence of "chronic miasms," as Hahnemann
        termed them, the number of which have been added to since his day.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my work these play a
        very important part in case-taking, especially in chronic cases. I
        always "fish" for them, and generally find one or more than
        one. If a case has "never been the same" since an attack of
        influenza," whatever else I may give the <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculin
        of Koch</font></i> is certain to have a run. If there is consumption or
        pulmonary trouble in the history, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bacillinum</font></i>
        is generally given in one or more potencies. If cancer is thrown up in
        the history, <i><font color="#0000ff">Carcinosin</font></i>, or one of
        the numerous other nosodes of cancer may be called for to clear up the
        symptoms. And perhaps more frequently than any the "Tree of
        Life" -<i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja occidentalis</font></i>. I
        have written somewhere that the old axiom, "when in doubt give <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>," has given place for me to
        "When in doubt give <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>."
        Thuja is, of course, a sycotic and corresponds to the wart producing
        constitution.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among the questions all
        patients who come to me have to answer is "How many times have you
        been vaccinated&nbsp;? When last&nbsp;? and did it take&nbsp;?" <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> is the leading agent to clear the way
        for other remedies when there is any active vaccinal taint present, and
        nowadays the taint is pretty newly universal.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thuja</font></i> is
        also the chief antidote to the effects of Tea, which we all drink. So,
        in all chronic cases, "When in doubt give <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>,"
        if the more mechanical symptom-matching has not thrown up a clear
        indication for something else.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here I cannot do better
        than cite a case which illustrates this point in case-taking, and though
        it comes from a lay source -if a Church dignitary can be called a
        layman- it is none the worse for that. The role of Physician and Padre
        were united not many centuries ago, and when Man has recovered his lost
        knowledge of Himself, it is probable that they will be united again.
        Here at any rate is the experience, and I give it because it is better
        than anything which I have handy of my own.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My very good friend,
        Canon Roland Upcher, Rector of Stradbroke in Norfolk, sent the article
        containing it in the form of a letter to THE HOMEOPATHIC WORLD and it
        was headed "Consumption and Vaccination." Here it is&nbsp;:-</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img height="233" alt="Dr Harold Fergie WOODS (1888-1961)" src="./case_files/woodsh02.jpg" width="183" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i><font color="#0000FF">Re</font></i>
        Dr. Fergie Wood's remarks, <i><font color="#0000ff">Homœopathic World</font></i>,
        August 1924, about <i><font color="#0000ff">the probable existence and
        action of Consumption and Vaccinosis miasmata in the human system to be
        reckoned with in dealing with disease</font></i>&nbsp;: This I have
        proved as fact, on several occasions, and I wish to record one
        remarkable case, which came under my notice and cure. A woman fifty
        years of age, was taken into a certain hospital in a former parish of
        mine-suffering from great pain, in the lower abdomen with vomiting, she
        was unable to keep any food down.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two eminent surgeons
        from a certain county town met the three local practitioners in
        consultation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They unanimously
        diagnosed the case as undoubtedly cancer of the stomach. The X-ray was
        not used.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as it was in so
        difficult a position it was judged too dangerous to operate upon&nbsp;;
        and the poor woman was sent home to die. However, not without a second
        consultation at her home.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Result</font></i> -the
        first diagnosis was confirmed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The woman was in such a
        desperate condition, that she could only lie in bed and groan. She
        neither could take any food nor retain nor pass anything.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under these
        circumstances, I determined to see whether Homœopathy could do any
        good.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First Question&nbsp;:
        "Have you any history of consumption in your family&nbsp;?"</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer</font></i>&nbsp;:
        "Yes&nbsp;! My brother and sister both died of consumption."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second Question&nbsp;:
        "Have you ever been re-vaccinated&nbsp;?"</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer</font></i>&nbsp;:
        "Yes&nbsp;; about five years ago, and I have never been well
        since."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third Question&nbsp;:
        "Did you ever have a bad fall, or blow in your stomach&nbsp;?"</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer</font></i>&nbsp;:
        "Not lately"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But did you "EVER
        have a bad Fall&nbsp;?"</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer</font></i>&nbsp;:
        "Yes&nbsp;; when I was about seventeen or eighteen, I fell off a
        swing on to my stomach."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now follows the
        treatment according to Homœopathy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first place I
        had to knock down two stone walls before the indicated remedy could get
        through to the local mischief.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first wall was that
        of Consumption. Received 5 globules of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bacillinum</font></i>
        30 in single dose. Called three days afterwards, found the woman gone
        out, had walked a mile and a half down to the town.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next day she was
        greatly excited, so I called again.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, Mrs. F.,
        are you mad&nbsp;? What have you been doing, going out walking to town&nbsp;?"</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Answer</font></i>&nbsp;:
        "Well, sir, I felt, and still feel, so much better&nbsp;; I can eat
        and drink and keep it down, and I have less pain."</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wall No. 1 knocked down</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next came the Vaccinal
        wall and she received two doses, one drop of <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>
        Ø, twenty-four hours apart.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called at the end of
        the week. The woman met me at the door with "Please, sir, a
        discharge has set in&nbsp;!"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Good gracious&nbsp;!
        Where from&nbsp;?" "Please, sir, from the womb&nbsp;!"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This discharge
        continued for a week and the tumour in the abdomen, with <i><font color="#0000ff">outside</font></i> swelling nearly as big as a football,
        slowly subsided.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as the woman
        appeared so weak and prostrate with the discharge, I got frightened and
        judged it well to antidote the <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>,
        so administered <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> 30, one
        dose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Next day the discharge
        ceased and the tumour immediately began to swell up again.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Question&nbsp;? Is wall
        No. 2 knocked down&nbsp;?</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cannot tell, but anyhow
        the woman is a "<i><font color="#0000ff">Daisy</font></i>"&nbsp;:
        so I will try the Homœopathic rule and give her some "Daisy."
        Anyhow, it is God's remedy for bruises. (Why&nbsp;? Because the more the
        Daisy is cut, trampled on and bruised the better it grows.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he accordingly received
        three drops of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellis Perennis</font></i> Ø,
        and I left her with the remark, 'I think you will find that will do your
        "belly" good&nbsp;!'</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unable to visit again
        for a week. When I had to go into the woman's neighbourhood to take a
        Confirmation class, called, found the woman washing clothes in back
        kitchen.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, how are
        you, Mrs. F.&nbsp;?"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"<i><font color="#0000ff">Quite well</font></i>, thank you, sir&nbsp;!"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Quite well&nbsp;?&nbsp;!&nbsp;!
        How's that&nbsp;?"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Well, sir, three
        days after you gave me that last dose, I had a great bearing down as if
        I was going to have a baby and THAT thing all came away, 4 lb. of it,
        and I and my husband buried it in our garden&nbsp;!"</p>

        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reflection</font></i>.
        The two stone walls, having been knocked down by <i><font color="#0000ff">Bac</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellis</font></i> was able to get through and
        do its work. -Q. E. D.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This happened
        fifteen years ago and the woman is still alive and flourishing."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here again, as
        Hahnemann put it, the name of the disease was no concern of the
        prescriber, and the name of the medicine was no concern of the patient.
        But the former got the true picture of the invisible disorder of the
        vital force in his imagination, whether the academicals had given it the
        right name or not. And his knowledge of the powers of drugs to bring
        about a like disorder enabled him to counter the morbid vibrations in
        the order of their origin. The consumptive tendency the patient brought
        into the world with her. The vaccinal taint was super-imposed on that,
        and re-imposed still later. The traumatism came after the first
        vaccination and before the second.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a complicated case
        of this kind the most urgent and active of the miasms or causes is
        generally the first to be tackled.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, in addition to
        the miasms, or chronic disease poisons, there is the highly important
        question of Causation. This may prove the leading indication and if
        recent, the only one. Accidents and shocks, physical mental and
        emotional, are highly important points to be considered in remedy
        selecting. The remedy which meets these may clear up the entire case, or
        it may clear away the traumatic element and leave the course open for
        remedies than are more directly indicated by the symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let us take an example
        from <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>. One day I accidentally
        ran a piece of wire into my thumb, resulting in very acute pain, as was
        natural. I had a small vial of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>
        Ø at hand, and removing the cork, placed the injured point over the
        mouth of the vial and inverted the bottle so that the tincture came into
        immediate contact with it. The pain vanished, seeming to travel up the
        arm and away, and there was an end to the trouble.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a case of traumatism
        it is very important to get the remedy in action without delay. I have
        known <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> given <i><font color="#0000ff">instantly</font></i> in the case of falls when nothing
        was broken or dislocated, remove all trouble almost as completely as in
        the case of the punctured wound.</p>

        <b><font size="4" color="#000080">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">5. THE VALUE OF THE NAMES OF DISEASES.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regard to the
        question of "Names of Diseases," let me say this by way of
        qualifying some previous remarks. The fixing of the correct nosological
        label on each case is both important and useful when it can be done. If
        it were not so, books like The Prescriber would be unnecessary. But,
        when this is not possible, Hahnemann's method enables the homœopath to
        steer a safe course through the uncharted sea, whilst the allopath is
        left completely befogged.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been speaking so
        far of cases of disease which are running a more or less chronic course.
        In acute cases, case-taking is a somewhat different matter. That is to
        say the physician must take his points and digest them rapidly, and here
        the value of the nosological label comes in. The correct name of the
        disorder goes a long way towards pointing out the corresponding remedy.
        At any rate it reduces the selection to a group from among which the
        simile or the simillimum is most likely to be found.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the case of
        epidemics there will generally be found one or two remedies which cover
        the bulk of the cases, and when these are found much of the wear and
        tear of remedy selection will be saved by the correct nosological name.
        In other cases, when the "totality" is obtained there will
        generally stand out certain symptoms which have got to be matched if the
        simile is to be obtained. Because it is not every sensation of a patient
        which can be dignified with the name of "symptom" from <font color="#000080">the prescribing point</font> of view. Generalities are
        of very little use. Particulars are necessary, and every pain complained
        of must submit to cross-examination. "Where&nbsp;?" "When&nbsp;?"
        and "How&nbsp;?" are questions to be answered. The exact <i><font color="#0000ff">locality</font></i> of a pain or sensation is the first
        point to note. The <i><font color="#0000ff">time</font></i> of its
        occurrence is the next. Then come the conditions under which it either
        appears, or grows worse or better. And, in addition, the pains or
        sensations which occur concomitantly with it. When you have got these
        particulars about a sensation or pain, you have a real symptom that has
        character and distinction about it, which makes it possible to match
        with something equally distinctive in the repertory and materia medica.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This piece of advice
        let me give you&nbsp;: Never make a prescription without noting down
        something to indicate <i><font color="#0000ff">why</font></i> you gave
        that particular remedy. Then, when you see the patient next, you will
        have something to tell you whether your shot has gone home, or whether
        you have scored a miss. The mere report of a general expression of
        "better" or "no better" is not sufficient for this.
        Generalities are all very well for the allopath, but the homœopath is
        the servant of Nature, and truth to minute particulars is exacted of all
        her servants.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A final bit of
        practical advice is this. In searching the Materia Medica for a remedy
        in a case it frequently happens that we come across an indication for a
        remedy suitable for another case we have under treatment. When this
        happens, at once put down the name of the remedy on the record of the
        second case and it will be ready when the patient next appears. If it is
        not entered at the time of finding the chances are that it will be
        forgotten when it is wanted. The study of the Materia Medica is thus
        often doubly and even trebly fruitful.</p>
