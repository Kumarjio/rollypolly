        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr John Henry CLARKE" src="./how_files/clarke02.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="189" height="183">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE completion of my <i><font color="#0000ff">Dictionary of Practical Materia Medica</font></i> and of
        its <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i> since the
        sixth edition of The Prescriber appeared, enables me to give more full
        directions to my readers than I could before as to the best way to
        approach the study and practice of homœopathy. I have therefore decided
        to add to the former introductory portion of <i><font color="#0000ff">The
        Prescriber</font></i> a separate essay, which I think will prove useful
        alike to the student who is desirous of acquiring the homœopathic art
        and to the practitioner who has had to be content hitherto with
        fragmentary implements.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prescriber</font></i>
        was originally designed to put into convenient and accessible shape all
        the more salient indications for the use of homœopathic remedies from
        the <i><font color="#0000ff">clinical point of view</font></i>. This is
        the approach which naturally first invites those who have been drilled
        in the practice of the ordinary schools. But homœopathy can never be
        properly practised by means of a clinical Index or Repertory (such as <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> is in essence) unaided by
        other works. The homœopath must have his foundation authority always
        ready for instant reference. This authority is the Homœopathic Materia
        Medica.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is of the greatest
        importance that a clear conception should be formed at the outset as to
        what the Homœopathic Materia Medica is. It is so unlike anything known
        as Materia Medica in the old school, that it is a pity, as I have
        pointed out below, that a different name could not have been found for
        it. The homœopathic materia medica consists of a <i><font color="#0000ff">Register of Symptoms</font></i>. It is the <i><font color="#0000ff">Semiology of Drugs</font></i>. For the practice of homœopathy
        we must know the symptoms which each drug has produced, and we must have
        these so arranged that they can be found instantly for any required
        region of the body. Hahnemann arranged them, for each of the remedies he
        tested, in a definite anatomical order, and this arrangement is the
        foundation of the order in which the symptoms are given in all works on
        the subject compiled since his day. This is named technically in
        homeopathy "The Hahnemannian <i><font color="#0000ff">Schema</font></i>."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The homœopathic
        materia medica thus consists of a <i><font color="#0000ff">schematic
        arrangement of the symptoms produced by each drug</font></i>, together
        with amplifications from the observed action of remedies in practice.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt="Dr Richard HUGHES (1836-1902)" src="./how_files/hugues02.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="228" height="309">When I
        commenced the practice of homœopathy I found no little difficulty in
        the fact that the works on Materia Medica were too numerous and too
        scattered to be readily accessible. The only book which gave a
        comprehensive idea of the remedies contained in the homœopathic materia
        medica was Dr. Hughes's Pharmacodynamics&nbsp;; but this work, whilst
        giving much information about homœopathic remedies, is in no real sense
        a homœopathic materia medica at all&nbsp;: it contains no <i><font color="#0000ff">Symptom Register</font></i> of the remedies it speaks
        about, and yet, for better or worse, it has had to do duty for a materia
        medica for many practitioners&nbsp;; and as its form is like that of the
        materia medicas of the old school, it has appealed very strongly to new
        converts.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was the
        consciousness that something more was needed that impelled me to
        undertake the compilation of my <i><font color="#0000ff">Dictionary of
        Practical Materia Medica</font></i>, which after sixteen years of labour
        saw the light. In this work I have given, as Hahnemann has done, the
        Symptom Register (or Schema) of each drug, which is the foundation of
        the work. In addition, I have given an introductory essay on each drug
        which enables the reader to apprehend its main characteristics. At the
        head of each remedy, under the heading, "CLINICAL," I have
        given a list of the principal diseases in which it has been used in
        practice. At this point I have linked the work to <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>. Among the names of diseases
        given under this heading in the Dictionary, I have printed in italics
        those under which, in <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>,
        the indications for this remedy will be found.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the introductory
        article prefixed to the Symptom Register, or Schema, of each remedy, I
        have been able to condense the history of the work it has accomplished.
        In this way the Dictionary illustrates and illuminates the Schema and
        makes the study of the individual symptoms much more easy and
        interesting than it otherwise might be. Thus it comes about that the <i><font color="#0000ff">Dictionary</font></i> comprises a whole library of
        clinical experiences which could only be reached otherwise by the
        expenditure of much time, labour, and research. Moreover, a great deal
        of it could not be found at all&nbsp;; since it was gathered by myself
        in conversations from the great clinicians whom it was my privilege to
        know.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has been a source of
        very great satisfaction to me that the work was immediately recognised
        on its appearance, by those best able to judge, as filling a place that
        had long remained unoccupied. On the other hand, the force of old habit
        is so strong that many who had contentedly settled down within the
        limits of older works have not seen the necessity of enlarging their
        borders and accepting the liberty which is within their reach. This is
        one reason why at this juncture I think it essential to draw attention
        to the way in which the study and practice of homœopathy may and should
        be approached.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many ways in
        which the practice of homœopathy may be approached&nbsp;; some find one
        way more suited to their genius, some another. But I am writing now
        primarily for those who use <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>,
        and will therefore take the approach by way of a Clinical Repertory.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will suppose that my
        reader is one who has become convinced of the truth of Hahnemann's law,
        and of the efficacy of his method, and who wishes to avail himself of
        the power it puts into the hands of one who can use it&nbsp;; and I will
        suppose, further, that <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>
        has been put into his hands a, a ready instrument by means of which he
        can put its precepts to the test. With this book at his elbow he will be
        able to find, in a case of any disease, the remedies that are most
        generally appropriate, with their differential indications. In most
        cases he will be able to find a remedy which fits with tolerable
        closeness of similarity the case it question, and will thus be enabled
        to prescribe. But it will sometimes happen that the differential
        symptoms named in <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> are
        not sufficient to enable a choice to be made with due certainty. In that
        case if reference is made to the Materia Medica, the actual symptoms of
        the different remedies can be studied in full, and compared with each
        other.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this point it is
        necessary to mention the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory to
        the Dictionary of Materia Medica</font></i>. This is a
        "Clinical" Repertory and much more besides, as I shall explain
        later. But it is different from <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>
        in two respects&nbsp;: it names far more remedies under each heading,
        and it gives no differential indications. In the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i>, under each rubric, the
        remedies mentioned in <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>
        will be found printed in italics, and those not mentioned therein, in
        Roman type. It is thus a complement of <i><font color="#0000ff">The
        Prescriber</font></i>, giving a greatly extended list of remedies under
        each rubric, and reference to the <i><font color="#0000ff">Dictionary of
        Materia Medica</font></i> will supply the necessary information to
        enable the practitioner to make a choice among them. <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> and the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i> together provide as
        complete an approach as is possible, I think, to homœopathic practice,
        from the clinical aspect.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, after all, this is
        only a limited approach-that is, it is an approach to a limited area of
        the field. It is the glory of Hahnemann that he liberated medical
        practice from its bondage to the names of diseases. Every case of
        disease is a problem in itself -presenting a new combination of morbid
        phenomena&nbsp;; the symptom-lists of the homœopathic materia medica
        presenting the possibility of finding similar combinations under one or
        other of the remedies named. Clinical repertories form one out of many
        of the means of fitting the remedy to the case.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">2. THE COMPARATIVE VALUE OF SYMPTOMS. "THE
        PRESCRIBER" AND THE "CLINICAL STORY." CASES IN POINT.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before proceeding
        farther it will be well to make clear that some symptoms or
        disease-manifestations are of much more value than others from the point
        of view of selecting the remedy&nbsp;; and it often happens that those
        symptoms which are of the greatest value in correctly naming the
        disease, are of the smallest value in diagnosing the remedy. It will be
        noted throughout <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> that
        in distinguishing one remedy from another great attention is paid to the
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Times</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Conditions</font></i>
        under which the various symptoms are better or worse--ameliorated or
        aggravated. (The sign "&gt;" is used to indicate amelioration,
        and the sign "&lt;" aggravation.) This point is often of more
        consequence than the actual symptom itself. And yet these
        characteristics would give little or no help in the diagnosis of the <i><font color="#0000ff">disease</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps it may help in
        understanding the differential value of symptoms and their Conditions or
        modalities if I instance a case. Miss T., 60, consulted me on October 7,
        1908, about a pain which had troubled her more or less for twenty-five
        years. It affects the <i><font color="#0000ff">right side</font></i> of
        the head and right cheek. In the temple are violent sharp shoots of
        pain. In the cheek it is a sudden pain, burning as if on fire. It is <i><font color="#0000ff">worst</font></i> while eating&nbsp;; <i><font color="#0000ff">worse</font></i> by touch&nbsp;; better after eating. It
        is <i><font color="#0000ff">worst</font></i> if the patient is chilled&nbsp;;
        and is sometimes <i><font color="#0000ff">worse</font></i> at night.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In dealing with a case
        like this it does not assist us much whether we name the affection
        "neuralgia", "neuritis," or "Tic
        douloureux" -we must deal with it on the strength of its
        characteristic symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first point of
        importance to note is the <i><font color="#0000ff">locality</font></i>
        of the pain -it is <i><font color="#0000ff">one-sided</font></i>, the
        side affected being the <i><font color="#0000ff">right</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is -it
        is a <i><font color="#0000ff">sudden</font></i> pain- violent, sharp,
        shooting, and burning. In this instance the nature of the pain is of
        importance on account of the peculiarity of <i><font color="#0000ff">suddenness</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next point is the <i><font color="#0000ff">condition</font></i> -aggravation <i><font color="#0000ff">by chewing</font></i>, by the least <i><font color="#0000ff">movement</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">touch</font></i>&nbsp;;
        <i><font color="#0000ff">and the last</font></i> point -aggravated <i><font color="#0000ff">at night</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If this patient had
        applied to an old-school practitioner all these details would have been
        useless to him&nbsp;; all he would have needed to base his prescription
        on would have been the word "neuralgia." It would have
        signified nothing, so far as his prescription went, whether it was right
        side, left side, or both sides. It would not have mattered what made it
        better or what made it worse, or at what time of day it came on. To the
        homœopath these are everything.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turning to <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>, under the heading of
        "Neuralgia" will be found a number of remedies affecting the
        right side of the head and face, and among them this&nbsp;: "Sudden
        pains, especially of right side of the head and face, &lt; by the least
        movement or touch, eating or speaking&nbsp;; &lt; 4 to 8 p.m., <i><font color="#0000ff">Lyc</font></i>." <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
        200 was prescribed, and two months later the patient wrote to say
        "the pain was relieved in a most wonderful way."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other ways in
        which this remedy might have been found besides consulting <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>&nbsp;: it could have been
        found by the ordinary symptom repertories, and it could have been found
        by reference to the Materia Medica itself. The fact that the pain was on
        the <i><font color="#0000ff">right side</font></i> of the head and face
        was enough to make any one but slightly acquainted with the homœopathic
        Materia Medica look up <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>&nbsp;;
        and a reference to the headings HEAD, FACE and TEETH would quickly
        reveal its appropriateness. It is impossible to carry all the symptoms
        of the Materia in one's head, but it is quite possible to remember a
        very large number of the characteristic symptoms and modalities (or
        Conditions) of the chief remedies. And after all, the best repertory any
        one can have is in his own memory. Only it must be possible to
        supplement it whenever required. Every remedy has a c umber of symptoms
        and modalities which are GENERAL in respect to it. That is to say, they
        qualify a very large proportion of its manifestations. So that when the
        practitioner meets with them in a patient he will be able to select the
        remedy even if the <i><font color="#0000ff">particular</font></i>
        symptoms are not in precise correspondence.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it is the same with
        patients. Many patients have GENERAL conditions which belong rather to
        themselves than to the particular complaint they may be suffering from,
        and when these am present they are often of greater importance from the
        prescribing standpoint than the actual symptoms of the disease. For
        instance, if the cardinal symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        crop up in a patient-sinking at the pit of the stomach at 11 a.m.&nbsp;;
        aggravation of the symptoms at night in bed&nbsp;; hot hands and feet,
        burning on the soles, must put them out of bed to find a cool place -<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> will be the remedy for the patient,
        no matter what the nature of the disease may be.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the heading
        "CHRONIC DISEASES" in <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>,
        I have indicated how this knowledge may be made use of in selecting
        remedies. In this way The Prescriber is something more than a <i><font color="#0000ff">mere</font></i> clinical repertory -it is a repertory of
        <i><font color="#0000ff">localities</font></i>. Under the different
        organs and parts of the body named will be found the remedies which have
        a specific relationship to them. Further, under the heading MIND will be
        found some leading mental symptoms and states, the presence of which,
        complicating bodily diseases-or, "concomitant" with them, as
        it is technically called in homeopathy-will point to the remedy to be
        selected.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will now relate
        another case in illustration. J. P., 58, a coachman, was sent to me by
        his master on May 10, 1910. He had had severe domestic trouble, and was
        suffering from great mental depression, and, in addition, there was pain
        in the head. The pain was situated in the vertex, and was greatly
        aggravated if he was in the least worried.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second of the five
        sections into which the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory to
        the Dictionary of Materia Medica</font></i> is divided is a repertory of
        CAUSATION. It is often of great importance to know the cause in which
        every state has originated. The effects of a chill, physical injury or
        mental shock correspond to different remedies, and the knowledge of the <i><font color="#0000ff">cause</font></i> is often an important guide in finding
        the remedy. On turning to this part of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical
        Repertory</font></i>, under the heading "Worry" will be found
        among the remedies <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>. As this
        patient had had much worry and as his complaint was aggravated by worry,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> 30 was given. But it did no
        good. The reason of this failure was this -although worry was an
        exciting factor in the case it was not the fundamental cause. The
        complaint belonged to the patient himself. The condition now was&nbsp;;
        head bad&nbsp;; pain at vertex&nbsp;; comes any time&nbsp;; feels it for
        a time after getting into bed&nbsp;; very low spirited. Hands and feet
        warm and moist.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On referring to the
        description of different constitutions under CHRONIC DISEASES in <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>, it will be found that this
        patient corresponds to <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> in
        some of these characteristics&nbsp;: hot, perspiring hands and feet&nbsp;;
        low spirits&nbsp;; night aggravation. On referring to. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> in the Materia Medica, under section
        HEAD it will be found that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        has numerous pains referred to the vertex. On these indications <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> 30 was prescribed, with very speedy
        relief to all the symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the improvement
        only went a certain way and then ceased. What next&nbsp;? There is a
        section of the CLINICAL. REPERTORY which I think I use more than any
        other, and which I fear most of my readers have not learned to use, or
        feel the want of it is the section Of CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the olden days when
        homœopaths had fewer remedies to commit to memory, each remedy was
        known much more intimately than it is at present. It was not only known
        as an entity in itself-it was known in its relations to its friends. For
        example, if <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> had relieved
        a case of inflammatory or congestive trouble and then ceased to help,
        the old homœopaths would know that one of the nearest relations to <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>., and one of its best friends, is <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>. And they would naturally think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> before any other to prescribe in
        the case. In mm Repertory of CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS I have given in
        tabular form a list of all the relations of remedies so far as recorded.
        This shows at a glance which remedy follows any remedy well -which are
        followed well by it, which are compatible, which are complementary,
        which inimical, and which antidotal. These lists are not to be regarded
        as complete or exclusive, but as far as they go I find them most helpful
        and suggestive. And whenever I meet an instance in which one remedy
        helps out the action of another in a marked way I enter it on my list
        for future use, and this I advise my readers to do likewise.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This by the way. My
        patient now remarked that although he was much better in himself, he
        still had the pain in his head and it was <i><font color="#0000ff">worse
        when he had his hat on</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Referring now to <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> under HEADACHE, it will be
        found that <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> has a headache
        at the vertex which is <i><font color="#0000ff">worse when covered</font></i>.
        Turning now to the CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS of the CLINICAL REPERTORY it
        will be found that <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> is one
        of the remedies which is compatible with Sulphur. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> 30 was now given, with complete
        relief of these symptoms. The patient's livery hat was heavy, so it was
        particularly trying in his employment.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The relief in this case
        continued for several months, when an attack of influenza brought back
        the old trouble. When the influenza was cured, the old head pain
        remained and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> only
        partially relieved it. What was next to be done&nbsp;? Turn once more to
        the Repertory of CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS under the reference, LYCOPODIUM.
        Among the remedies given as "complementary" -that is to say
        most closely related in action and helping out each other- is <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>. A reference to the Materia
        Medica will show a dose similarity between the two remedies in their
        symptoms and Conditions. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelid</font></i>. 30
        was given, and this completely relieved the patient.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Returning now to the
        former patient, Miss T., who suffered from neuralgia. In her case also <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> failed on one occasion to control
        the pain, and here again the complementary remedy, <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>, came to its aid and removed the
        whole trouble, and further illustrated the use of a repertory of
        Clinical Relationships.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each of these cases <i><font color="#0000ff">pressure</font></i> was a condition of aggravation. It
        is necessary to be able to reduce to its common denomination on the
        instant any symptom which a patient presents to you. Patients must not
        be expected to describe their sensations in the bald language of the
        repertories. A patient will be more likely to say "The pain is much
        worse when my hat is on," than he will to say "The pain is
        aggravated by pressure." In the same way a patient with right-sided
        sciatica will be more likely to say, "I can't bear to lie on my
        right side," than he will say. "The pain is aggravated by
        pressure." But it comes to the same thing, and many a case of
        right-sided sciatica with this modality have I cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> fails to indicate the remedy
        required for any case, on turning to the same heading in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i> a large number of remedies
        not mentioned in <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> will
        in most instances be found. For their special indications it will be
        necessary to turn to the Materia Medica and compare them one with
        another. In compiling the Materia Medica I was able to save much space,
        and consequently save my readers much trouble, by placing at the head of
        each article a list of the diseases to whose symptoms the drug
        corresponds. The necessity for much repetition was thus avoided, since
        the leading indications for any remedy are available in any disease,
        whatever may be its name, when these are prominent in a patient. But the
        list, nevertheless, gives a, good idea of the range of the drug's action&nbsp;;
        and when the whole of these lists came to be indexed, as it is in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i>, it afforded at once a
        valuable approach to the Materia Medica from the clinical side and a
        greatly enlarged clinical instrument as compared with <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>. It would be beyond the scope
        of the work to attempt to give the differential indications for each
        remedy in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i> as
        is done in <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>&nbsp;;
        just as it would be beyond the scope of <i><font color="#0000ff">The
        Prescriber</font></i> to have included all the remedies named in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i>. But the lack of
        differential indications in the latter is no real loss, since the
        Materia Medica supplies them for ready reference and the study of the
        Materia Medica entailed in the use of it is pure gain. <i><font color="#0000ff">There is no road to the practice of homœopathy</font></i>
        -whether it is the clinical road or the symptomatic road- <i><font color="#0000ff">which does not entail close and constant study of the
        Materia Medica</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have already referred
        to the CLINICAL RELATIONSHIPS section of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Repertory</font></i>
        and some of its uses. In homœopathic practice it is often necessary to
        modify or arrest the action of a remedy which has been administered. The
        means of doing this will be found in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Antidote</font></i>
        column of this section. When more antidotes than one are given, the one
        which corresponds most closely to the symptoms of the case which it is
        desired to put an end to will be selected.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Robert Thomas COOPER (1844-1903)" src="./how_files/cooper02.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="192" height="329">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The late Dr. R. T. Cooper
        found great assistance in his practice from utilising the natural
        relationship of remedies. For instance, when he had given with good
        effect a remedy belonging to a certain botanical species and the good
        action came to an end, his next choice was often a remedy from an allied
        species, which would carry on the action. In the <i><font color="#0000ff">Repertory</font></i> these will be found for instant
        reference under the section of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natural
        Relationships</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Repertory of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causation</font></i> I have already mentioned&nbsp;;
        this may be also used as a limited Repertory of Aggravation. Causation
        and Aggravation are not identical, but they frequently overlap.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other section of
        the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i> is the
        Repertory of <i><font color="#0000ff">Temperaments</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Age</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sex</font></i>.
        In the selection of a remedy it often makes a great difference whether a
        patient is young or old, stout or spare, male or female, fair or dark,
        nervous or lymphatic. In this section of the Repertory all these points
        will be found indexed for ready reference.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I may mention a
        practical point which I have found a great time-saver. Wherever possible
        I block out on the front edges of my Repertories the different sections.
        In this way I am able to find with great ease the part I want to refer
        to without great turning over of pages.</p>

        add here a few words in regard to my <i><font color="#0000ff">Dictionary
        of Practical Materia Medica</font></i>. I do not offer it to the
        exclusion of any other author's work, but I do offer it as the most
        complete and perfect presentment of the homœopathic Materia Medica for
        the student and practitioner. It is the fruit of years of labour to
        combine within the compass of a single work the material needed for
        daily practice, arranged in such a form that all the sections of the
        information included are readily accessible and do not obscure each
        other. In my work it will not be found that one "cannot see the
        forest on account of the trees." The introductory part of each
        article gives the reader in the shortest compass possible, a picture of
        the whole drug with the history of the work it has done. So that the
        work is just as useful for the student as it is for the practitioner. I
        have seen it stated in lists of works recommended for students that my
        Materia Medica is a valuable book of "reference" -meaning by
        this that it is a book to be referred to now and then. It is more than
        that&nbsp;: it is a book for reference every hour of the working day&nbsp;;
        it is a book for the study and the prescribing desk. It was compiled,
        first and foremost, for my own personal needs in practice -just as <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> was- and I offer it as the
        greatest labour-saving and labour-rewarding materia medica for student
        and practitioner which we possess at the present day. With the <i><font color="#0000ff">Dictionary of Materia Medica</font></i>, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Repertory</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> it is possible too practise
        homœopathy -with works which only <i><font color="#0000ff">describe</font></i>
        remedies without giving their actual symptoms this is not possible.</p>

        justice to his work. But I no less strongly urge on him to obtain other
        works as soon as ever he is able to introduce them into his
        armamentarium. And first among these is von Bœnninghausen's famous
        Pocket Book. The full title of this work is Therapeutic Pocket Book for
        Homœopathic Physicians to use at the Bedside and in the Study of the
        Materia Medica. This is, in a sense, the parent of all our Repertories
        and an analysis of the Materia Medica. The most convenient edition is
        Dr. T. F. Allen's, for it is in reality a "pocket" book.* [*
        Dr. Boger's large work, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bœnninghausen's

        characteristic Materia Medica as well as the repertories of all his
        works combined into one. It is a most valuable compilation, but it has
        not the portability and compactness of the Pocket Book.] This work
        carries analysis and generalisation as far as these can be carried, and
        forms a symptom index of the Materia Medica that is beyond price. My
        work has been to approach practice from the clinical side. Bœnninghausen's
        work approaches it from the symptomatic side. His Repertories of
        "Sensations" and of Aggravations and Ameliorations have been
        of enormous service to many generations of homœopathic practitioners
        and will be to many yet to be born. I urgently advise every reader to
        procure a copy and to read and reread Bœnninghausen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Preface</font></i> -and, incidentally, I may say the
        same in respect to the prefaces of my own works to those who possess
        them. I will take the liberty of quoting here a passage of Bœnninghausen's
        Preface, which may give my readers a stimulus in their study of the
        Materia Medica&nbsp;;-</p>

        the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pocket Book</font></i> at the
        bedside," says Bœnninghausen, "much depends upon whether one
        is entirely a beginner, or is already somewhat skilled in homœopathy.
        But he who knows nothing whatever must, indeed, make a most careful
        search for everything without exception. The more he knows, the less he
        has to look for, and, finally only to use it here and there to help his
        memory. This may be best shown by an example&nbsp;: this I have taken
        for the purpose from my most recent practice, wherein the choice of the
        remedy was not difficult, and at first seemed very easy, though, through
        lack of attention a mistake might very easily have been made. This case
        may serve for a beginner in homœopathy to try his own skill.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E. N. of L., a man of
        about 50 years, of a blooming, almost florid complexion, usually
        cheerful, but during his more violent paroxysms inclined to outbreaks of
        anger with decided nervous excitement, had suffered for a few months
        with a peculiar kind of violent pain in the right leg after the previous
        dispersion allopathically of a so-called rheumatic pain in the right
        orbit by external remedies, which could not be found out&nbsp;; this
        last pain attacked the muscles of the posterior part of the leg,
        especially from the calf down to the heel, but did not involve the knee
        or ankle-joint. The pain itself he described as extremely acute,
        cramping, jerking, tearing, frequently interrupted by stitches extending
        from within outward&nbsp;; but in the morning hours, when the pain was
        generally more endurable, it was a dull burrowing with a bruised
        feeling. The pain became worse towards evening and during rest,
        especially after previous motion, while sitting or standing,
        particularly if he did it during a walk in the open air. While walking
        the pain jumped suddenly from the right calf into the left upper arm, if
        he put his hand into his coat pocket or his breast and kept the arm
        quiet, which was relieved by moving the arm, and then the pain suddenly
        jumped back son into the right calf. The greatest relief was experienced
        while walking up and down the roam and rubbing the affected part. The
        concomitant symptoms were sleeplessness before midnight, frequently
        recurring attacks in the evening of sudden flushes of heat with thirst
        without previous chill, a disagreeable fatty taste in the mouth, with
        nausea in the throat, and an almost constant pressing pain in the lower
        part of the chest and pit of the stomach as if something there was
        forcing itself outward.</p>

        who is perfectly familiar with the action of his remedies will long
        remain in doubt as to the correct remedy in this case, with so complete
        and accurate a picture of the disease, for all these symptoms together
        correspond to a single one, which is thoroughly homœopathic&nbsp;; but
        the beginner will be obliged to look for nearly every symptom and only
        after long search will he find the one most fit among the concurrent
        remedies. Between these two extremes of knowing and not knowing, lie
        many degrees of partial knowledge, which require a more or less frequent
        consultation of the book.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One person, for
        example, knows that the pains repeatedly changing from place to place,
        with the fatty taste in the mouth, the sleeplessness before midnight,
        and others of the symptoms mentioned belong especially to the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, but he is not sure whether the
        remaining symptoms also belong to it, and he will not, if he acts
        conscientiously, spare the trouble to compare these latter&nbsp;; but he
        will soon see that <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> is not
        the correct homœopathic remedy, because, in addition to the mental
        symptoms there are others which are not similar, but, indeed, are
        directly contradictory to it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another person who has
        studied more the peculiarities of the pains distinctly remembers that <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> corresponds to the paralytic and
        bruised pains as well as to the jerking tearings, and the stitches from
        within outward and to the pains jumping from place to place. In
        addition, he believes that also symptoms like sleeplessness before
        midnight, the aggravation during rest, as well as the relief from motion
        and rubbing, together with the flushes of heat with thirst, correspond
        to this drug, but because he does not know, he also must consult the
        books&nbsp;; and he will soon meet with contradictions, just as the
        previous one did, and he will see clearly the unfitness of <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> for the case.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neither of these two,
        however, ever think of administering to the patient a remedy whose
        curative power in this case is so improbable&nbsp;; but as conscientious
        homœopathic physicians they will look further and compare, and by the
        help of this book they will soon find, without great difficulty, the
        only really indicated homœopathic remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even a third
        physician, educated in homœopathy, one who recognises the
        contra-indications of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>, and other concurrent remedies, does
        not know sufficiently that <i><font color="#0000ff">Valeriana</font></i>
        corresponds to the chief symptoms, and in order to be perfectly sure
        about this rather infrequently used remedy, he will quickly look up the
        few doubtful symptoms, and convince himself that this drug among all the
        known medicines, is the best adapted to this case, as was proved by the
        result&nbsp;; for after a single very small dose exhibited in a high
        potency in water, the whole trouble, with all the concomitant symptoms,
        was completely removed in three days."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I leave my readers,
        after perusing this case, to make up their minds as to which of Bœnninghausen's
        degrees of knowing and not knowing they consider that they belong.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In conclusion, I will
        repeat that there is only one road by which success in homœopathic
        practice may be attained, and the name of this road is -Work. It is only
        hard application, intelligent and unremitting, that can ensure success
        in the mastery of the infinity of details comprised in the homœopathic
        materia medica. The result is worth all the labour and very much more
        besides&nbsp;; but I would seriously warn off at the outset all who
        think they will find in homœopathy an easy road to the cure of the
        sick. It is possible by the improvement of our instruments to make the
        practice of homœopathy less arduous than it is at present, but like
        every other great and good work it can never be made easy.</p>

        was designed primarily for the beginner in homœopathic practice by one
        who had felt the need of a work of the kind when he became convinced of
        the truth of the homœopathic law. As all British homœopaths receive
        their training in allopathic schools, it is inevitable that allopathic
        ways of looking at things should to a large extent prevail for some time
        after their graduation or conversion. In the old-school text-books
        remedies are considered in relation to <i><font color="#0000ff">diseases</font></i>&nbsp;:
        in homœopathy remedies are considered first and foremost in relation to
        <i><font color="#0000ff">individuals</font></i>. In homœopathy when the
        cardinal symptoms of a remedy are marked in any case, the name of the
        disease the patient may be suffering from is of no weight whatever in
        determining either for or against the selection&nbsp;; the remedy which
        corresponds to the symptoms of the patient must be given, and if the
        case is curable it will cure. To give an example, I may relate a case as
        it was told to me. A patient suffering from pneumonia had gone from bad
        to worse under homœopathic treatment based on nosological lines, when
        it was decided to call in further help. The consultant on entering the
        room observed the patient shrink away from him in great fear. He found
        him collapsed and cold, with cold sweat on his forehead. He said to the
        other attendants that he would take their word for all the rest of the
        patients symptoms&nbsp;; there was one medicine that would cure the
        patient and one only, and that was <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum
        album</font></i>&nbsp;; and <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album</font></i>
        very speedily did. <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i> had not
        been given in the case before because it was not recognised by those in
        attendance as a pneumonia remedy. In a very severe case of
        pleuro-pneumonia of my own I rapidly cleared up all the dangerous
        symptoms with <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>, to which I
        was led by the delirium of the patient, in which he saw animals about
        his bed, and especially a large black dog. The patient was a youth and
        there was no question of alcoholism in the case. One of the best cures
        of rheumatic fever I ever made was with <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>,
        which was given because of the mental concomitants in the case&nbsp;:</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mention these
        instances to show that however valuable a clinical repertory may be, it
        can never be paramount in homœopathy&nbsp;; and whilst <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> may seem to justify the
        allopathic arrangement of medicines as remedies for diseases, I only
        offer it as one, and that the most elementary, of the methods by which
        the similar, that is to say, the homœopathic remedy may be found. For a
        clinical or nosological repertory is perfectly justifiable from a homœopathic
        point of view, provided its limits are clearly understood. Names of
        diseases correspond to well-defined groups on the symptom-record of
        various medicines. <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>
        shows at a glance what these medicines are, and how they are to be
        distinguished from each other. Thus in a very large number of cases a
        closely similar, if not the most similar remedy may be found.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Henry Clay ALLEN (1836-1909)" src="./how_files/allenh03.jpg" border="0" align="left" hspace="5" width="207" height="265">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But whilst
        offering <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i> as the most
        natural step in homœopathic practice to an allopathically trained mind,
        and as a convenient remembrancer to older homœopaths, I wish most
        strongly to insist that readers shall make themselves superior to it and
        independent of it by a thorough acquaintance with the materia medica and
        by making themselves proficient in the use of symptom repertories.
        Classical works like those of Bell on <i><font color="#0000ff">Diarrhœa</font></i>,
        H. C. Allen on <i><font color="#0000ff">Intermittent Fever</font></i>,
        Minton on <i><font color="#0000ff">Uterine Therapeutics</font></i>, all
        give elaborate and detailed repertories of symptoms compiled on a
        clinical basis, enabling the reader to find by their means the most
        similar remedy. The scope of <i><font color="#0000ff">The Prescriber</font></i>
        does not permit of my doing this in respect to all diseases, but I have
        adapted from Hering his excellent repertory to <i><font color="#0000ff">Toothache</font></i>
        (which has often enabled me to find the remedy), and I give this in its
        proper place as an example of the kind, and as an exercise for junior
        homœopaths in the use of the more advanced methods. Although primarily
        arranged as a repertory for <i><font color="#0000ff">Toothache</font></i>
        it is equally available for neuralgic pains affecting the face and head
        whether connected with diseases of the teeth or not.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A homœopathic
        practitioner must perforce be original if he is to achieve any great
        measure of success. No two cases are exactly alike, and he must be
        prepared to adapt his means to any case that may arise, and happily
        there is in homœopathy scope for the exercise of a great variety of
        talent. In most cases there are more remedies than one that will benefit&nbsp;;
        and if the exact simillimum is not found, the next or the next to that
        will give a measure of help&nbsp;; so the beginner need not abandon the
        ideal as too difficult of attainment. Then there are many different <i><font color="#0000ff">kinds</font></i> of <i><font color="#0000ff">similarity</font></i>,

        <p align="JUSTIFY">7. HAHNEMANN'S DOCTRINE OF CHRONIC DISEASES.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hahnemann's discovery
        of the nature of chronic diseases is evidence that his mind was not
        closed to further progress, as it well might have been, by the
        transcendent importance of his discovery of the homœopathic law.
        Finding that certain cases were only temporarily benefited by remedies
        which seemed to correspond accurately with the apparent symptoms, he was
        led to note that there were points of importance in the cam to which
        they failed to correspond. In the cases referred to there was the fact
        that the disease manifestations, though taking the form, it might be, of
        an ordinary acute illness, were really only one event in a series&nbsp;;
        and it was necessary to find remedies corresponding to the <i><font color="#0000ff">series</font></i>, if a cure was to be affected. For
        instance, an attack of asthma may look, and generally does look, like an
        isolated event in a patient's history. But inquiry will probably
        discover that the same patient has at a former period suffered from a
        skin eruption, a diarrhœa, or some other affection. All these are not
        many diseases, but varied expressions of one morbid taint. In the case
        of syphilis a sequence of disease-manifestations was known to exist.
        Hahnemann added to this two others-"sycosis," or the
        "miasm" whose keynote manifestation is the appearance of
        fig-warts, and the origin of which is often traceable to constitutional
        gonorrhœa&nbsp;; and, chiefly, the "miasm" which he called
        "Psora," whose keynote is the appearance at some period of the
        patient's history of an itch-like eruption. Without going into the
        question of how far Hahnemann was right or wrong in his explanation of
        the genesis of this miasm, there can be little doubt (in my mind there
        is none whatever) that he was right in the main fact. Old-school
        medicine has confirmed his observation in respect to the constitutional
        nature of gonorrhœa, and the "herpetic diathesis" of French
        writers is only Psora doctrine in another form.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I may here point
        out that it is necessary to bear in mind the particular meaning attached
        to the word "chronic" by Hahnemann in the phrase "chronic
        diseases." He did not use it in the ordinary sense of
        "long-lasting"&nbsp;; he meant a disease which was due to a
        poison (or "miasm," as he called it) which had a <i><font color="#0000ff">chronic evolution</font></i>, just as the poison of
        scarlatina, for example, has an <i><font color="#0000ff">acute evolution</font></i>.
        Syphilis is a "chronic disease," in his sense whether the
        manifestations are acute or whether they are long-lasting.
        "Psora," is a chronic disease in the same way, though
        sometimes its manifestations are intensely acute. Another difference
        between an acute and a chronic miasm is that the acute naturally ends in
        complete recovery or in death&nbsp;; whereas a "chronic" miasm
        continues to act in varying or alternating ways throughout life unless
        it is cured by proper treatment.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having discovered the
        existence of a chronically operating poison in the essential character
        of certain diseases, it was necessary for Hahnemann to find remedies
        which had corresponding chronic action in order to obtain complete
        similarity. These he found in the remedies named by him anti-sycotic,
        anti-syphilitic, and chiefly, and-psoric. Since Hahnemann's day much has
        been done in tracing out the lie-history of morbid diatheses, and there
        is no necessity to limit the number of chronic diseases to the three he
        described. It is open to original minds to find other miasms and their
        similars. The use of the nosodes in homœopathy, and the use of
        "vaccines" and "serums" in allopathic imitations of
        homœopathy are instances of possible developments on these lines.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But no matter what may
        be the plane on which the points of similarity are sought and obtained,
        the individual symptoms of each case must in the last resort determine
        the choice of the remedy. It is not a matter of giving an
        "antipsoric" for a case of psora&nbsp;; if the case is indeed
        a psoric case, though some good may be done with a medicine whose
        disease-making action is not of the psoric order, the case will not be
        cured. The division of remedies into antipsoric and non-antipsoric is a
        convenience for narrowing down the choice, as the "chronicity"
        is the most important feature to be matched&nbsp;; but the choice of the
        particular medicine of the group is determined by the individual
        symptoms of each case. Hahnemann's doctrine of chronic diseases is from
        first to last one of <i><font color="#0000ff">practical</font></i>
        import.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The doctrine of <i><font color="#0000ff">genius epidemicus</font></i> is another practical aid in
        prescribing. Just as one proving gives only a partial idea of a drug, so
        one case of an epidemic disease gives only a partial idea of the
        disease. It is perfectly legitimate homœopathy to take a number of
        cases and having found the drug disease which corresponds most closely
        to the disease in all its developments, to give that drug in a routine
        fashion to all cases which do not manifestly call for some other drug.
        The use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> in this way in
        the influenza epidemics has saved me a great deal of brain-work and has
        cut short, often in a few hours, many an attack of the, disease. That
        does not mean that I have given no other remedy, on the contrary, I have
        had to use in some case or other almost every remedy in the materia
        medica&nbsp;; but the knowledge of the doctrine of the <i><font color="#0000ff">genius epidemicus</font></i> has saved a vast amount of

        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last court of
        appeal, when the choice of a remedy is not clear, is the Homœopathic
        Materia Medica. In the homœopathic materia medica, as I have already
        shewn, the symptoms belonging to each remedy are arranged in a certain
        order, namely, under the headings of the different anatomical sections
        in which they have occurred, so that the practitioner can find at once
        any symptom which has occurred in any particular part of the body. All
        the Eye symptoms, for example, are given in the section "Eyes"&nbsp;;
        all the Stomach symptoms in section "Stomach," etc. There are
        some who regret that Hahnemann did not keep his provers' day-books and
        publish them instead of this classified list of symptoms (which is known
        in homœopathy as The Schema). This regret would be justified if the
        symptoms were not available in their individual capacity and did not
        admit of re-combination to an infinite extent. But a definite symptom is
        available for its value, just as a definite coin is, independently of
        the particular mint from which it may have been issued. It is this which
        renders homœopathy the flexible and adaptable instrument that it is&nbsp;;
        and it is this which makes the <i><font color="#0000ff">Symptom Register</font></i>
        the essential of the homœopathic materia medica.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, the
        symptoms are not only available in their individual capacity, they will
        bear reducing to their elements and still be available, just as the
        symptoms of a patient will bear the same reducing. For instance&nbsp;: a
        patient complains that he was seized with violent pains in the back
        immediately on stepping out of a bath. The bath here was evidently the
        determining condition. But the bath is not the <i><font color="#0000ff">essential</font></i>
        of the symptom, the essential is the <i><font color="#0000ff">wetting</font></i>.
        On referring to a repertory, it is under the heading, "Aggravation
        by wetting," that the corresponding remedy will be found and
        probably not under <i><font color="#0000ff">bath</font></i>. In this
        case <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> was the remedy.
        Conversely, take the example of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>,
        which has this symptom&nbsp;: "Just before getting into bed, sudden
        explosion and clashing in l. ear, as from breaking of glass&nbsp;; the
        clash of the glass was heard at the bottom of the head, and extended
        thence towards r. ear." If that symptom were met with in a patient,
        or any symptom closely resembling it, <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
        alone would cure&nbsp;; but the symptom may be generalised and utilised
        (and I have so utilised it) for sensations of explosions in the head, or
        a noise as of something breaking. Should a symptom like this occur when
        the remaining symptoms seem to indicate <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
        equally with other remedies, its presence would determine the choice.</p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This brings me to speak
        of Symptom Repertories, and among them Bœnninghausen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Pocket Book</font></i>, as I have already said, holds a
        place of very great importance. Bœnninghausen realised and demonstrated
        the legitimacy and the utility of paraphrasing and generalising symptoms
        and their Conditions, and his lists of Conditions of Aggravation and
        Amelioration, of Sensations, of Desires and Aversions are invaluable.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It frequently happens
        in practice that a symptom is wanted with some peculiar Condition of
        aggravation or amelioration. Several medicines are found having the
        symptom, but not one with the Condition. On referring to Bœnninghausen,
        one of them is found in the list of remedies having that particular
        Condition, though it had not been noted in connection with the symptom
        in question&nbsp;; but that does not destroy its appropriateness. Bœnninghausen
        showed that when a medicine manifested any symptom occurring under any
        peculiar Condition, that Condition might, and probably would, indicate
        the medicine when the same Condition appeared qualifying any other
        symptom. At any rate it would determine the choice of one of several
        remedies, all of which had the symptom but only one the Condition.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the same with
        peculiar sensations&nbsp;: the sensation may have bean experienced in
        one part of the body in the prover, but that does not destroy the
        remedy's appropriateness should the identical sensation appear in a
        different part in the patient Hence the utility of Bœnninghausen's list
        of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sensations</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Totality of
        Symptoms insisted on by Hahnemann as the basis of correspondence does
        not refer only to their numerical sum, but to their relative importance.
        It is not every sensation of a patient that constitutes a symptom from
        the prescribing point of view. In every case the practitioner has to ask
        himself what the points are on which he intends to base his
        prescription. It has been said that if three leading characters of a
        case are found under a given remedy, there is a "three-legged
        stool" on which a prescription may be based with every chance of
        success.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are some classes
        of symptoms which are more important than others to be matched, and it
        may be useful to indicate some. Without attaching much significance to
        the order, I should name these as of especial importance&nbsp;: (1)
        Mental concomitants with bodily diseases. (2) Very peculiar symptoms and
        very peculiar combinations of symptoms. (3) Precise localities. (4)
        Course and direction of pains and sensations. (5) Alternating symptoms.
        (6) Conditions of Time&nbsp;: Periodicity and the occurrence of symptoms
        at particular times of the day or night, or phases of the moon or year.
        (7) Conditions of Temperature, sensitiveness to heat and cold, and
        aggravation or amelioration by change of temperature, and at the various
        seasons.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Comte Adolph von zur LIPPE (1812-1888)" src="./how_files/lippea04.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="196" height="231">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of
        repertories is in itself an art which the homœopathist must diligently
        cultivate. I cannot say that I find any one entirely satisfactory. The
        plan of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Cipher Repertory</font></i>
        (excluding the cipher) is to my thinking the best&nbsp;; but this is not
        complete, and many of the completed portions are long out of date.
        Gentry's <i><font color="#0000ff">Repertory</font></i> is the easiest to
        use, and I should be sorry to be without it. Kent's great <i><font color="#0000ff">Repertory</font></i> is the fullest and most
        satisfactory. Among other repertories, Lippe's, that of Curie's <i><font color="#0000ff">Jahr</font></i>, and Winterburn's <i><font color="#0000ff">Pocket Repertory</font></i> may be named. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Index</font></i> to Allen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Encyclopædia</font></i>
        is indispensable to those who possess that work. There is also a <i><font color="#0000ff">Repertory</font></i> to Hering's <i><font color="#0000ff">Guiding Symptoms</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="11"></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <b><font size="4" color="#000080">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">11. VARIOUS MATERIA MEDICAS.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among materia medicas,
        all who can should possess Allen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Encyclopædia</font></i>
        and Hering's <i><font color="#0000ff">Guiding Symptoms</font></i>. The
        former contains all the symptoms of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica Pura</font></i> and of the Chronic Diseases of Hahnemann.
        Dudgeon's translation of the former is the best in the English language.
        Among works <i><font color="#0000ff">about</font></i> the materia
        medica, Farrington's <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Materia Medica</font></i>
        and Dunham's <i><font color="#0000ff">Lectures on Materia</font></i> and
        Kent's <i><font color="#0000ff">Lectures</font></i> are admirable works.
        Dudgeon's translation of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i>
        should be in every library. The want of a full materia medica, giving a
        full Schema and an explanatory introduction had been long apparent to
        me, and I endeavoured to supply the want by my <i><font color="#0000ff">Dictionary
        of Practical Materia Medica</font></i>. A thorough knowledge of the
        materia medica is only to be gained by <i><font color="#0000ff">persistently
        using it</font></i>&nbsp;; by persevering search for the most similar
        remedy for every case which arses, whenever the remedy is not at first
        obvious to the prescriber. The search will not always be crowned with
        success, but let not the practitioner be disheartened by this&nbsp;; the
        search itself is of use to him as it will have helped to make him
        familiar with his instruments, the materia medica and the repertories.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The knowledge of
        remedies in homœopathy is like the knowledge of words in speaking a
        foreign language. The beginner in homœopathic practice should, in the
        first instance, make himself absolute master of some dozen of the most
        widely useful remedies, with all their characteristics and
        peculiarities, of the conditions under which their symptoms appear and
        cease, and of their special times of occurrence, if they have any. The
        following is a list I recommend, the medicines being named in the order
        of what I regard as their importance&nbsp;: -<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconitum</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
        vomica</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Silica</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>,
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>. An accurate knowledge of
        the symptomatology of these drugs will enable the practitioner to deal
        successfully with the majority of cases he meets. But it will also do
        more than this for him&nbsp;; it will give him a solid basis on which to
        build up a knowledge of the rest of the materia medica.</p>
