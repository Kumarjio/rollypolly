        <p align="JUSTIFY">1. THE PLAN.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr John Henry CLARKE" src="./plan_files/clarke01.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="207" height="306">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plan of the work is
        simple. The names of the diseases are given in alphabetical order&nbsp;:
        and where a disease has more names than one, each name is given with a
        reference to the one under which the treatment is described. This will
        generally be found to be the name by which it is most commonly known.
        Under each heading the names of the medicine or medicines most useful in
        the particular disease are given. When more medicines than one are
        named, there will be found prefixed to each the symptoms which would
        lead the prescriber to choose that in preference to the rest. Where no
        such differentiating symptoms can be given, the medicines are named in
        the order of their general applicability, and numbered&nbsp;; it is
        intended that the prescriber shall use them in that order, if there are
        no other symptoms in the case pointing to one more than the other.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where a number of
        symptoms are given as belonging to one medicine, these will be found
        separated either by commas or semicolons. All those only separated by
        commas belong to a single group, and these must all be present in order
        to indicate the medicine. For example&nbsp;; under Sciatica will be
        found, "Pains made worse by sitting, relieved somewhat by walking,
        entirely by lying down, <i><font color="#0000ff">Am. mur</font></i>.&nbsp;:"
        this means that <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium muriaticum</font></i>
        is indicated when the pain of sciatica is marked by all these
        characters. If in any case the pain were noted as being "relieved
        somewhat by walking," without the other two, the medicine would
        probably not be appropriate. Again, under the same heading we have&nbsp;:
        "Purely neuralgic&nbsp;; accompanying paralysis&nbsp;; in old and
        debilitated subjects, <i><font color="#0000ff">Ars</font></i>.&nbsp;:"
        this means that <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is likely to
        benefit all cases that are of a purely neuralgic kind, as opposed to
        inflammatory or rheumatic&nbsp;; also sciatica in patients suffering
        from paralysis, also sciatica in old and debilitated patients. Each
        characteristic is sufficient in itself to indicate the medicine, and
        this the semicolons are intended to show&nbsp;; should two of the
        characteristics, or all three, be found in the same patient, the
        medicine would be still more strongly indicated. But it must be
        understood that all the medicines given under any heading have a
        distinct specific relation to the part or the affection under
        consideration&nbsp;; and whilst I have sought to give the distinguishing
        traits of each drug, that the best medicine may be chosen first, still
        all the medicines are more or less homœopathic, and if one fails, the
        one which seems next in appropriateness should be tried. But it must
        always be borne in mind that the whole of the symptoms of any patient
        must be taken into consideration, and not the most urgent only. The drug
        which corresponds best to the totality of a patient's symptoms will be
        the most certain to cure.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under certain headings,
        such as <b><font color="#000080">Tongue, Taste, Smell</font></b>, etc.,
        I have given some characteristic conditions, which, however, do not in
        themselves constitute disease. They occur as symptoms in various
        diseases, and as the result of the action of certain drugs, and are
        often useful in determining the choice of a medicine, if that medicine
        is in relation to the case as a whole. For example, if a prescriber is
        in doubt which of two medicines to give in a case of dyspepsia, a
        reference to the heading <b><font color="#000080">Tongue</font></b> may
        show which of these medicines is capable of producing a condition of
        tongue most like that present and determine the choice.</p>

        <b><font size="4" color="#000080">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">2. RULES FOR PRESCRIBING.</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having found the
        medicine which corresponds to the case, there remains the questions of
        attenuation, dose, and frequency of repetition. In these matters
        dogmatism is out of place, and every man's experience is his best guide.
        But some guidance is needed before experience is available, and this I
        have tried to give. In the matter of attenuation, my own experience
        leads me to believe that all attenuation, from the mother-tincture
        upwards, are curative, provided the choice of the medicine is correct.
        When the similarity is very close between drug symptoms and patient's
        symptoms, the attenuation cannot be too high to cure, and the higher it
        is the more permanent the cure is likely to be. But the question of
        attenuation is secondary to that of the selection of the drug.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is taken for granted
        that the reader possesses at least an elementary acquaintance with homœopathic
        pharmacy. It will be sufficient to state here that the sign Ø following
        the name of a medicine stands for the strongest <font face="Times New Roman">preparation of the drug (the sign &#952; is also
        used in the same sense by some writers) and the numbers 1, 2, 3, etc.,
        or 1x, 2x, 3x, etc., for the different attenuations. The figures 1, 2,
        3, etc., refer to the centesimal attenuations&nbsp;; the proportion
        being </font>in "1," one part of the strongest preparation of
        the substance to 99 of the attenuating medium, and in "2," one
        part of "1" to 99 parts of the attenuating medium, and so on.
        The figures 1x, 2x, etc., refer to the decimal scale of attenuation&nbsp;;
        "1x" meaning one part of the strongest preparation to 9 parts
        of the attenuating medium, 2x one, part of lx to 9 parts of the
        attenuating medium, and so on.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.</b> <i><font color="#0000ff">The Attenuation</font></i>. -After the name of each
        medicine there will be found the number of the attenuation recommended.
        When several attenuations are believed to be equally efficacious, the
        numbers of the lowest and the highest are given, and a bar is placed
        between them. For example, "<i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.
        1-3" would mean Acon. 1, 3x, 2, or 3, and the prescriber may select
        any one of those as he thinks fit. When the choice lies between two
        only, the two numbers are joined by an "or"&nbsp;: as "<i><font color="#0000ff">Cham</font></i>. 1 or 6." When no sign or figure
        follows the name of a medicine the pure substance is meant&nbsp;: e.g.,
        "<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali i.</font></i> gr. ii." means
        two grains of the iodide of potassium itself.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>2.</b> <i><font color="#0000ff">The Dose</font></i>. -In all cases where no, mention of
        dose is made, one drop of the tincture, or one pilule or tablet is
        intended. The choice between tinctures and pilules is one of convenience
        chiefly. When tinctures are preferred, one or two drops to a tea,
        spoonful or a dessert-spoonful of water is the proper dose, or, if given
        in powder, one or two drops to a sufficient quantity of sugar of milk.
        Distilled water, or water that has been boiled, is preferable to
        tap-water. When triturations are intended, this is always indicated by
        the number of grains for a dose following the number of the attenuation.
        For example, "<i><font color="#0000ff">Silic</font></i>. 3, gr.
        iii." means three grains of the third trituration of <i><font color="#0000ff">Silica</font></i>. Triturations may be given-dry on the
        tongue, or suspended in water, as preferred by the patient.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Samuel HAHNEMANN (1755-1843)" src="./plan_files/hahnem158.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="120" height="160">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>3.</b> <i><font color="#0000ff">The Repetition of the Dose</font></i>. -For the sake of
        simplicity and uniformity, the times of the repetition of the dose are
        given in terms of hours and minutes. After the name of a medicine with
        its attenuation, "l h." means that the medicine is to be given
        every hour&nbsp;; "2 h." every&nbsp;; two hours&nbsp;; "6
        h." every six hours, or four times a day&nbsp;; "8 h."
        every eight hours, or three times a day&nbsp;; "10 m." every
        ten minutes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In acute cases
        HAHNEMANN directs that the medicine should be given at short intervals,
        in chronic cases at longer. The rule laid down was to give one dose in a
        chronic case, and wait until its effects were exhausted. This may be
        done in some cases&nbsp;; in others it is well to repeat the dose at
        short intervals until a decided effect is produced, and then wait until
        the action is exhausted before again repeating it. If the same symptoms
        return the same remedy must be repeated&nbsp;; if they are changed, a
        different remedy must be sought.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the latest edition
        of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i>, the sixth, Hahnemann
        taught that the cure of chronic cases could be expedited by repetition
        of the remedy, but before each dose the bottle containing the mixture
        should receive ten forcible succussions. In this way the potency is
        raised with each dose, and the remedy can be repeated without fear of
        troublesome aggravations. The practice of prescribing medicine mixed
        already by the chemist is thus preferable to that of ordering quantities
        of the tincture to be mixed at home.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Robert Thomas COOPER" src="./plan_files/cooper01.jpg" align="right" hspace="5" width="179" height="285">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The practice of giving a
        single dose and allowing time for it to evolve its action is an
        excellent one when it is possible to carry it out and observe the
        effects. Dr. R. T. Cooper treated many cases of chronic disease with
        great effect by administering unit doses of Ø tinctures, allowing them
        to act for two or three weeks without repetition. Dr. Cooper directed
        that the dose should be taken on an empty stomach -at least two hours
        after a meal, no food to be taken for at least one hour after the dose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>4.</b> <i><font color="#0000ff">The Time of Day</font></i>. -The best time for giving
        medicine (when the repetition of the dose is not too frequent to allow
        of choice) is from an hour to half-an-hour before food. In ordering a
        medicine every six hours (four times a day) the first dose may be given
        on rising, the second an hour before lunch, the third an hour before
        dinner, and the last at bedtime. An exception must be made in the case
        of the lower attenuations of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i>. These should be given
        immediately after food.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>5.</b> <i><font color="#0000ff">Alternation</font></i>. -Remedies may sometimes be
        alternated with advantage, but this should not be adopted as a routine
        method. If two medicines seem almost equally indicated it is best to
        decide upon one of them, and give that. When the prescriber has seen
        whether it answers his expectations or not, he will be able to decide on
        the propriety of giving the other. To give both at the same time
        destroys the value of the observation, and tends to weaken the
        prescriber's powers of diagnosing the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>6.</b> <i><font color="#0000ff">Sleep</font></i>. -Except in dangerous acute cases
        patients should not be awakened from sleep to receive their medicine.
        When it is necessary to give the dose during sleep, it is often possible
        to do it without arousing the patient.</p>

        as would lie on a six-penny piece to be taken four times a day. (Small
        horn scoops are sold by the chemists made to hold one, two, or three
        grains each. In prescribing triturations it is often convenient to order
        one of these, and direct, "a scoopful to be taken," etc.). But
        it is more practical to order of the chemist as many powders as are
        likely to be required.</p>

        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bacill</font></i>. 200,
        gl. iv. once a week.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This may be ordered as
        follows&nbsp;:</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bacillinum</font></i> 200 four globules&nbsp;; of Sugar
        of Milk two grains. Make a powder. Send as many as required. One to be
        taken dry on the tongue once a week. Plain powders of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sach. Lact.</font></i> may be ordered in the interval if
        the patient cannot be made to understand the prolonged action of single
        doses. Or if other medicines are called for by special symptoms, they
        may be given between the doses without interfering with the
        constitutional action of the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In giving remedies for
        chronic conditions it is a good plan to prescribe the doses at bed-time
        or on rising and at bed-time. The patient has then no need to be
        thinking of getting the doses in during the day. In giving doses at
        intervals of several days it is convenient to prescribe a series of
        numbered powders, directing them to be taken at bedtime or at bedtime
        and on rising as the case may be. I find it useful to make the
        prescription in this way&nbsp;:-</p>
        <blockquote>
          <i><font color="#0000ff">
          </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> (30 / 1, 8, 15, 22) gl. vi.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mitte xxiv., Sig. One
        to be taken at bedtime, in numerical order. This means that of the 24
        powders, numbers. 1, 8, 15 and 22 have each six globules of the remedy.
        The rest of the powders are not <i><font color="#0000ff">directly</font></i>
        medicated, but that does not mean that they are not medicated at all.
        According to my observation they are medicated by contact in varying
        degrees and their variation is rather helpful than otherwise in
        developing the curative action of the remedy.</p>
