        <p align="CENTER"><font color="#000080" size="4">PREFACE.</font></p>
        </b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">THE PRESCRIBER was first published by the firm of
        Messrs. Keene &amp; Ashwell. Mr. Ashwell was himself the author of the
        invaluable <i><font color="#0000ff">Companion to the British and
        American Homœopathic Pharmacopeias</font></i>, a volume of about the
        same size as THE PRESCRIBER. It may interest readers to know how I came
        to compile the book. I had been at the time some nine years in homœopathic
        practice, and the only work of reference of the kind put into my hands
        by my instructors was the <i><font color="#0000ff">Clinical Index</font></i>
        of Dr. Ruddock's well-known <i><font color="#0000ff">Vade Mecum</font></i>.
        Excellent as this is, it is of necessity limited, and although I had my
        copy interleaved this soon became overloaded, and so I set about
        compiling a work which should more or less completely cover the whole
        ground. In this instance, as in that of most of my other works, my own
        necessities led to its compilation. I needed it for my own use, so that
        I might find instantly, without reference to long treatises or
        dissertations, the points needed for present application in the cure of
        the sick.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The prompt acceptance of the work by the homœopathic
        profession proved that I had not been wrong in believing that others had
        felt the need of a work of the kind as well as myself. And there has
        been no slackening in the demand for it ever since. A large edition has
        appeared in America, and it has been translated into Spanish for the
        benefit of the great Spanish-speaking population of both hemispheres.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The exhaustion of the last English edition has given
        me an opportunity of putting it through a complete revision, and very
        few are the pages on which I have not seen cause to make some addition.
        For the sake of Indian readers and those Britons whose lives are spent
        largely in tropical countries I have added items on diseases which are
        mostly met with in those parts. In compiling these the admirable work by
        Drs. E. A. Neatby and T. Miller Neatby, <i><font color="#0000ff">A
        Manual of Tropical Disease and Hygiene for Missionaries</font></i>, has
        been of great assistance. Another acknowledgement I have to make is to
        my friend Mr. W. H. Knight, the literary executor of the late Dr.
        Leopold Salzer of Calcutta, who, when he heard there was to be a new
        edition of The PRESCRIBER, sent me his own annotated copy. In this he
        has collated therapeutic items from many sources, including my own <i><font color="#0000ff">Materia Medica</font></i>. A large number of these will
        be found fitted into their own appropriate niches in the present
        edition.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The position of The PRESCRIBER in medical literature
        is unique. There are books in abundance which tell all there is to tell
        about diseases, their history, etiology, course, progress, pathology,
        histology and all the rest. But the weak point of them all is when they
        come to tell of the treatment. The directions these works give for
        treatment are couched in generalities as a rule. THE PRESCRIBER deals
        with nothing else but treatment, and the directions, instead of dealing
        with generalities, go into minute particulars for ready application to
        any case of any disease. The descriptions of disease I leave to its
        describers, and thank them for doing that part of the work. My part is
        to tell the practitioner what he can do when he has learned all the
        others can teach him.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That there are many in old school ranks who are
        anxious to learn I have good reason to know. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Lancet</font></i> has quite recently acknowledged that
        the homœopathic doctrine is true&nbsp;; but after delivering itself of
        the admission it stops there, and does not proceed to take the action
        which the admission would seem to require. It says "if the proof of
        the pudding is in the eating," it is impossible to deny that likes
        cure likes. But it declines to eat of the pudding or to invite its
        readers to the feast. So the task of providing the banquet is still left
        to the homœopathic body, and as long as healers of the sick can find in
        THE PRESCRIBER the nourishment they require, it shall be served up for
        them as well and as daintily as its author and publishers can effect.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Before concluding this preface I wish to say a word
        to my readers on behalf of that most important and essential person the
        homeopathic chemist. It is impossible for anyone to practise homeopathy
        properly without the aid of a skilful and conscientious chemist. No
        medical man can collect, prepare and dispense all the remedies of the
        homœopathic pharmacopeia by himself. He must have a pharmacist to do
        this for him, if not in the same locality as himself, yet somewhere
        within the reach of the post, even if it is a thousand miles away. It is
        nothing short of a calamity to homeopathy that of late years many homœopathic
        pharmacies have had to close down. The spread of "stores" has
        had a good deal to say to that, but not all. If homœopathic doctors had
        made more use of homœopathic chemists and done less dispensing
        themselves it would have been better for both. As for homeopathic
        medicines dispensed at "stores," I take no responsibility for
        them. They may be quite genuine and of proper dilutions, but at best
        they are second-hand. The "stores" do not keep skilled homœopathic
        chemists who know all about the characters of the drugs used by
        homeopaths, and that is what the homeopathic practitioner needs. When
        the right chemist is found, let him have all his share of the work. In
        localities where there is no chemist the practitioner must perforce be
        his own dispenser.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Trusting I may be pardoned for this lengthy preface
        to THE PRESCRIBER'S new edition on its fortieth birthday, I herewith
        make my bow to my readers and hope they will find in it all they expect.</p>
