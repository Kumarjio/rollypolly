          <br>Extract of super-renal bodies. Its chemical formula is C<font size="1">3</font> H<font size="1">3</font> A<font size="1">2</font> O<font size="1">3</font> and it forms shining prismatic crystals, which melt
          at a temperature of 207c.&nbsp;; it is most soluble in warm water. It
          has a bitter taste, which leaves a sensation of numbness of the tip of
          the tongue. In dilute acids it possesses a marked affinity for oxygen,
          and when exposed to the air it changes into oxyadrenalin which is
          poisonous, though not possessing the properties of Adrenalin. It is to
          this chemical change that constantly occurs in the tissues that the
          evanescent effect of the drug is due.
          <br>A number of cases of Addison's disease have been cured, and others
          arrested in their course, by Adrenalin. The most of these cases have
          occurred in the practice of other schools, and with large doses of the
          crude drug. Very few have been reported in the homœopathic school, in
          fact, Raue says he has been unable to find an authenticated case of
          this disease cured, in our literature. As yet we have but one proving,
          made in 1904 by students of the New York Homœopathic College, under
          the direction of Dr. V. L. Getman and the following provers&nbsp;: M.
          W. Macduffie, W. G. LaField, G. H. Clapp, J. B. G. Custis, Jr., G. C.
          Birdsall, and R. C. Miller. The day-books of provers are omitted.</p>
