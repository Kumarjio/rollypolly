          true classification, but probably a nosode or morbid product found in
          the belly of the sperm-whale, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Physeter
          Macrosephalous</font></i>. It is often found floating upon the sea or
          thrown upon the shore of the Baltic, or on the coast of Madagascar or
          Sumatra. But, perhaps the best specimens are those which whalers cut
          out and are to be found in Boston and other whaling ports. It has many
          characteristics of intestinal or biliary concretions and has been
          considered to be of hepatic origin, probably a fatty excretion from
          its gall-bladder. It was introduced by Hahnemann in 1827&nbsp;; proved
          by him and his friend, Count de Gersdorf, who personally obtained
          nearly one-half of the symptoms.
          <br>The so-called Oil of Amber (used by Dr. <i><font color="#0000ff">Holcombe</font></i>
          in hiccough) is Oleum Succinum, and should not be confounded with
          Ambergris.</p>

          <br>Revillout compares the general action of Ambra with that of Kali
          bromatum.
          <br>The effect appears quicker after Ambra, but that of Kali bromatum
          continues longer.
          <br>Ambra, therefore, is preferable for the removal of severe reflex
          actions, infantile spasms, puerperal eclampsia.
          <br>Ambra quiets beautifully the nervous restlessness of pregnancy and
          thus prevents convulsions&nbsp;; it also retards uterine contractions.
          <br>Revillout recommends Ambra in pregnancy&nbsp;:
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. To prevent eclampsia.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. To diminish too severe
          labor-pains.
          <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. In too early labor or threatening
          abortion.
          <br>But Ambra given too frequently and in too large a dose may also
          produce uterine atony.
          <br>Ambra given in large doses may generally remove convulsions, from
          whatever cause, and by diminishing nervousness acts favorably on
          nervous persons, infants and young girls.
          <br>Here, then, is another case of involuntary Homœopathy.
          <br>Ambra produces in the healthy burning in the sexual parts, with
          discharge of a few drops of blood&nbsp;; menses set in a few days too
          soon&nbsp;; it produces discharge of blood at other times than the
          catamenia, also fluor albus, and also perhaps ovaritis.
          <br>It also produces twitchings in muscular parts, spasms,
          restlessness, infirmity, anxiety, oppression, nervous weakness with
          irritability and impatience, twitching and jerkings in the
          extremities, with coldness of the body and great debility, a state so
