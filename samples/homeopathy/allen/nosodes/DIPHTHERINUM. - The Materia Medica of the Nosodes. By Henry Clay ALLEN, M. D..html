          malignant diphtheria received Diphtherinum 1m. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Skinner</font></i>) three times daily for eleven days,
          as a prophylactic, developing chilliness, high temperature, red face.
          She complained of being tired and cold, severe pain on swallowing and
          on the 12th day the tonsils and posterior walls of the pharynx were
          covered with dirty gray, yellowish membrane, corrugated vertically,
          like the surface of a washboard turned up.
          <br>Thursday, Nov. 14, 1907, began powders three each day for eight
          days, then two daily for two days.
          <br>Nov. 23, complained of being tired, sat down to rest three times.
          <br>Nov. 24, would lie down because tired, but after a while felt
          playful.
          <br>Nov. 25, temperature 103, pulse 148, full, with throbbing of
          carotids, eyes bright, face flushed, with centre of cheeks almost
          purple.
          <br>Throat dark red, no membrane&nbsp;; but on posterior wall of
          throat, yellow, dirty cream color with dry membrane in folds, up and
          down.
          <br>Monday night talks in sleep, with eyes wide open.
          <br>Wanted imaginary objects taken from room, and to "make those
          people get away." Sat up and picked among bed-clothes for strap
          for her school books.
          <br>Nov. 26, temperature 101.2°F, pulse, 116, membrane lighter and
          moist, thin in middle of throat.
          <br>Nov. 27, temperature 99.2°F, pulse 100. Throat clearing from
          middle.
          <br>Jerking of single limb, or shoulder, or finger.
          <br>Nov. 28, temperature 101.2°F, pulse 116. Desired to have mother
          hold her hand. Tongue whitish, with exceedingly red tip (moist).
          <br>Nov. 29, temperature 101.2°F, pulse 116, breath offensive.
          <br>Nov. 30, temperature 99.4°F, pulse 100. Membrane white, and
          showing more to front. Clearing from centre of posterior wall of
          throat.
          <br>Tongue coated whitish, with red papillæ&nbsp;; very red tip, with
          a dark red spot in centre of red tip. Slept well last night, until 4
          A. M., then was restless and wakeful&nbsp;; moved and changed
          position, moved arms and legs often, snored and fan-like motion of ala
          nasi, Skin seemed dry, forehead moist along edge of hair, when first
          falling asleep.</p>

          first from centre of posterior pharynx.
          <br>In centre of the tip of tongue was a very dark red spot, also very

          antitoxin is made.
          <br>These potencies have been very effective, not only in malignant

          <br>Diphtherinum has made many brilliant cures of diphtheria and
          post-diphtheritic affections to its credit, yet to receive its place
          among the remedies of the homœopathic Materia Medica it must pass the
          crucial test that all others have encountered, viz., a careful and
          thorough proving of the dynamic potency on the healthy. Thus far, like
          its great congener Antitoxin, its use has been clinical and empirical,
          the distinctive difference being that its action has been dynamic,
          while that of antitoxin is Chemico-catalytic.
          <br>Yet the empirical use of Von Behring's Antitoxin is a great
          advance on the former empirical methods of the profession and has
          proved a blessing to humanity.
          <br>The indications here given are chiefly clinical and are
          tentatively held until verified or disproved by provings.</p>
          <b><font color="#ff0000">
          </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Characteristics&nbsp;:</font></b>
          <br>Especially adapted to the strumous diathesis&nbsp;; scrofulous,
          psoric or tuberculous persons, prone to catarrhal affections of throat
          and respiratory mucous membranes.
          <br>Patients with weak or exhausted vitality hence are extremely
          susceptible to the diphtheritic virus&nbsp;; when the attack from the
          onset tends to malignancy (Lac c., Merc. cy.).
          <br>Painless diphtheria&nbsp;; symptoms almost or entirely
          objective&nbsp;; patient too weak, apathetic or too prostrated to
          complain&nbsp;; sopor or stupor, but easily aroused when spoken to
          (Bap., Sulph.).
          <br>Dark red swelling of tonsils and palatine arches&nbsp;; parotid
          and cervical glands greatly swollen&nbsp;; breath and discharges from
          throat, nose and mouth very offensive&nbsp;; tongue swollen, very red,
          little coating.
          <br>Diphtheritic membrane, thick, dark gray or brownish-black&nbsp;;
          temperature low or subnormal, pulse weak and rapid, extremities cold
          and marked debility&nbsp;; patient lies in a semi-stupid
          condition&nbsp;; eyes dull, besotted (Apis, Bap.).
          <br>Epistaxis or profound prostration from very onset of attack (Ail.,
          Apis, Carb. ac.)&nbsp;; collapse almost at very beginning (Crot., Mer.
          cy.)&nbsp;; pulse weak, rapid and vital reaction very low.
          <br>Swallows without pain, but fluids are vomited or returned by the
          nose&nbsp;; breath horribly offensive.
          <br>When the patient from the first seems doomed, and <i><font color="#0000ff">the most carefully selected remedies fail to relieve
          or permanently improve</font></i>.
          <br>Laryngeal diphtheria, after Chlor., Kali bi. or Lac c.
          <br>Post-diphtheritic paralysis - especially where Antitoxin has been
          used&nbsp;; many cases cured - after Caust., Gels., Nux, Secale and
          the best selected remedies have failed.
          <br>In post-diphtheritic paralysis and spinal affections following
          diphtheria many brilliant cures have been effected by the potencies.
          <br>The same indications for its use in all forms of diphtheria that
          are used when Antitoxin is exhibited.</p>
