          <br>The following are reported by Seward (Trans. C. N. Y. S., <i><font color="#0000ff">Medical Advance</font></i>, 1891, p. 150)&nbsp;:
          <br>A lady had taken electricity for partial paralysis of left arm.
          <br>During a thunder-storm felt severe electric shocks through the
          left foot, the entire left side of the body to the head, repeated at
          every severe electric discharge, which left that side and limbs
          painful for days.
          <br>The previous electrical treatment had rendered her more
          susceptible and its injurious effects will often last for years, or
          even during life, unless antidoted.
          <br>A young lady took an electro-thermal bath when she had a cold, and
          acute tuberculosis soon developed.
          <br>She died in spite of the best homopathic treatment.
          <br>A lady who had passed the climacteric had taken electrical
          treatment, at first going to the office.
          <br>Soon she became too weak to walk, her chest became weak and
          painful, and the arms stiffened and almost paralyzed&nbsp;; the entire
          body heavy and weak.
          <br>A young married woman had been under general and local electrical
          uterine treatment for several weeks, without benefit&nbsp;; complained
          of feeling so heavy, as though she "weighed a ton."
          <br>A woman received an atmopheric electric shock six or seven years
          before, and since had suffered in every electrical storm, even while
          it was miles away.
          <br>It affected the whole body, but was worse in the lower
          extremities.
          <br>During every storm her feet would "patter" upon the
          floor, and her husband, sitting upon her knees, could not prevent it.
          <br>She received three or four doses of Morphia acet. 200, and has
          never felt such effects from a storm since, now more than ten years.
          <br>My son, during the effects of a common cold, took and
          electrothermal bath.
          <br>Soon after felt a heaviness and stiffness of chest and shoulders
          he had never felt before&nbsp;; "his chest and shoulders felt
          like marble."
          <br>An incurable tuberculosis developed and he died in tow years.
          <br>Did not know he had taken bath for over a year after.
          <br>A brother of Dr. Hawley, while in New York in Nov., 1890, took a
          severe cold, followed by rheumatic fever&nbsp;; was treated homopathically,
          without relief&nbsp;; advised to try electro-thermal baths, and became
          worse.
          <br>Was removed to Syracuse and was under care of Drs. Hawley, Miller
          and Seward, with little or no benefit.
          <br>His sufferings were intense, his voluntary muscular and nervous
          systems were paralyzed by electricity, could neither move nor feed
          himself.
          <br>Was taken to his home in Illinois, and in May, six months later,
          could walk a little by dragging his feet.
          <br>He fell, and had hemorrhage from the lungs.
          <br>The doctor said there was no hope for a cure and gave him
          Morphine, as a palliation, in water.
          <br>In a few minutes after the first dose he said&nbsp;: "I can
          use my hands better than at any time since the electrical
          treatment," and under the antidote recovered.</p>
