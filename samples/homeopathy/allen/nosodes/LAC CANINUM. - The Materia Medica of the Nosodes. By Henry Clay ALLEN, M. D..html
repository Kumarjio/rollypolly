          <br>Like Lachesis, and many other well known polychrests in the
          Materia Medica, this remedy met most violent opposition from ignorance
          and prejudice. It was for years looked upon as one of the novelties or
          delusions of those who believed in and used the dynamic remedy&nbsp;;
          yet its wonderful therapeutic powers have slowly but surely overcome
          every obstacle.
          <br>It was successfully used by Dioscorides, Rhasis and Pliny in
          ancient times, and Sextus recommended it for the removal of the fetus.
          Sammonicus and Sextus praise it in photophobia, otitis and other
          affections of the eye and ear. Pliny claimed that it cured ulceration
          of the internal os. It was then used as an antidote to many deadly
          poisons.
          <br>The use of the remedy was revived by Reisig, of New York, who,
          while travelling in Europe, heard it lauded as a remedy for throat
          diseases, and on his return used it successfully in an epidemic of
          malignant diphtheria. He called the attention of Bayard. Wells and
          Swan to the wonderful results he obtained during that epidemic, and
          induced them to give it a trial.
          <br>Reisig potentized it to the 17th cent., from which the potencies
          of Swan and Fincke were prepared. The profession is indebted to the
          indefatigable labor of Swan for its provings, which were made from the
          30th 200th and higher potencies, and published in a small volume by
          Swan and Berridge, from which it was published in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Medical Advance</font></i>. The provings of this
          remedy have placed it among the polychrests of our school and verified
          and confirmed the clinical accuracies of the observers of ancient
          times.</p>

            <p align="CENTER">THE WORK OF AN ARTIST.</p>
            </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Dr. Wm. P. Wesselhoeft says&nbsp;: No more
            appropriate tribute can be paid to the memory of Dr. Adolph Lippe
            than to show his great sagacity in the application of medicine in
            disease.
            <br>It was not only his great knowledge of the finer and more subtle
            indications for remedies, as given in our Materia Medica, or his
            judicious examination of patients, which made him an acknowledged
            master of our art, but mainly that freer and wider application of
            our law which elevated him to the sphere of the true artist. His
            readiness and rapidity in getting at the gist of symptoms, even in
            the most complicated case, could never be called careless or hasty.
            It reminded me of the words of an eminent artist, who said&nbsp;;
            "The chief difficulty with most painters is that they see too
            much, and in seeing too much they get confused with endless detail,
            which leaves their work without character, and they have little to
            show for their pains."
            <br>He knew the value of our art so well that the commonplaces of
            every disease were almost instinctively avoided by him, and he never
            lost time in noting worthless signs, always looking and finding with
            unusual rapidity the salient points in the case before him. He
            heeded and lived up to the greatest thought of the master&nbsp;:
            "The physician's business is only with patients, not with
            diseases."
            <br>The cure of the following case will demonstrate what I mean by a
            freer and wider application of our law of cure&nbsp;:
            <br>I had treated the patient more than eighteen months without
            improvement, except that his great liability to taking cold had
            becomes less.
            <br>I copy from my record, taken December, 1881.
            <br>G. R., aged forty-five, light brunette, married ten years,
            general appearance healthy.
            <br>For six years has had no discharge of semen during coitus.
            <br>Occasionally nocturnal emissions.
            <br>Erections usually weak, give out during coitus.
            <br>Burning in perineum, worse after going to bed, and when thinking
            of it.
            <br>Drawing pains in testicles, with sensation of weakness of
            genitals.
            <br>Occasionally itching, dry eruptions in crotch and inner upper
            surface of thighs and anus.
            <br>With the sensation of weakness of genitals his eyes feel weak.
            <br>Very sensitive to cold and changes of atmosphere.
            <br>Takes cold easily, usually affecting nose and throat first with
            dryness, then with watery catarrh and sneezing, or he has aching
            pains in different parts of the body and limbs, changing location
            frequently.
            <br>Twenty years ago had African fever.
            <br>Never had gonorrhœa, syphilis, or other eruptions than those
            mentioned above.
            <br>All other functions normal.
            <br>While on a visit to Philadelphia he applied to Dr. Lippe, at my
            advice.
            <br>Dr. Lippe wrote me the following letter&nbsp;:
            <br>"I find that your patient had diphtheria about ten years
            ago, and was treated with inappropriate mercurials and gargles by
            Dr. The character of the attack was that it went from one side to
            the other and finally back again to the original side. Great
            weakness, almost paralytic, followed the attack, and he thinks he
            has never regained his full vigor and usual strength since this
            illness. His acute cold has always the character of shifting pains
            and change of location. I have given him a dose of Lac can. cm.,
            which may be required to be followed by a dose of Pulsatilla."
            <br>Suffice it to say that my patient never needed the suggested
            dose of Pulsatilla.
            <br>In three months after his visit to Philadelphia his wife was
            pregnant. She has since borne two remarkably healthy children.
            <br>As far as we know Lac can. has no sexual weakness. That fact
            disturbed Dr. Lippe very little in his selection.
            <br>He looked deeper and found the cause and the remedy. </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">This is true Homœopathic pathology</font></i><font size="2">. All the knowledge in the world of the special pathology
            of this case could not have revealed the remedy to any one. To the
            homœopathic artist, however, it was revealed and a man regained his
            manhood and became the father of two children after ten years of
            impotence.
            <br>Mrs. J. E. B., aged 29, blonde. For a week has felt a sense of
            impending illness&nbsp;; weary, languid, depressed.

            <br>Fever at 2 P. M. continued all night&nbsp;; chilly on
            movement&nbsp;; cheeks flushed and hot.

            become quite marked, so much as to cause a falling forwards of the
            head so that it rests on the upper portion of the sternum. There is
            return of fluid through the nose, and an evident weakness of the
            muscles of the upper part of the back. Phos. on general principles.

            condition.
            <br>Three weeks after recovery from diphtheria&nbsp;: Paralysis of
            muscles of the neck, quite marked, so as to cause falling forwards
            of the head until it rested upon the manubrium. Fluids return
            through the nose, and marked weakness of muscles of the upper part
            of the back. The paralysis becomes more pronounced, with staggering
            when walking&nbsp;; stiffness and soreness of the muscles of the
            neck. After Phos. and Rhus, though apparently well indicated, had
            failed, one dose of Lac caninum cured the diphtheria and &gt; the
            paralysis. - </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">Baker</font></i><font size="2">.</font></p><font size="2">

          <br>Sensation of a sac (lump&nbsp;?) in her throat on right side which
          seemed to descend when she swallowed, and scraped or rubbed against
          the mucous membrane as it went down&nbsp;; returning after
          deglutition.
          <br>Fauces and tonsils very sore and red.
          <br>Right tonsil appeared puckered and drawn up from circumference to
          centre.
          <br>In centre of right tonsil, a small black spot about the size of a
          pin-head.
          <br>Two long shaped ulcers on right tonsil, towards inner edge.
          <br>On third day a ring of small yellow blisters around each ulcer,
          which later presented appearance of a false membrane.
          <br>False membrane on right tonsil but not on left.
          <br>Left tonsil became sore and inflamed on second day, when the right
          was not nearly so painful&nbsp;; by evening pain and soreness returned
          to right side when left side was relieved.
          <br>This alternation from side to side continued one week when the
          painful symptoms wholly subsided.
          <br>All deglutition painful, but worse when swallowing solid food.
          <br>Pain extends to ear when swallowing.
          <br>Pains in throat worse in cold air.
          <br>Throat feels stiff as a board.
          <br>Feeling of lump in throat which goes down when swallowing, but
          returns&nbsp;; throat &lt; on right side.
          <br>A lady, aged 50, a widow, mother of one child, is syphilitic, and
          has suffered very much with inflammation and ulceration of the tonsils
          and fauces which are completely honeycombed by abscesses and for the
          last month the pain and soreness has changed from one side to the
          other every day.
          <br>For instance, the side that was sore yesterday is well to-day, and
          the side that was well yesterday is the sore one to-day.
          <br>She has been treated a long time for this disease without benefit,
          by a professed homœopath.
          <br>Four doses, 200th, of this remedy were given, two each day, when
          improvement set in, and in ten days she was well, and has so remained
          without further medication.
          <br>"Right to left, and from left to right" - daily. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Wakeman</font></i>.
          <br>One of my cases was little Moody, son of Moody, of "Moody and
          Sankey", sick with scarlatina "for the third time" (so
          reported).
          <br>His throat was full of large, foul, grey-yellow patches,
          deglutition extremely painful after sleep and from swallowing acid
          fruits, lumpy sensation in throat, unrest, delirium with undefined
          fears, considerable bright-red, fine eruption on face and chest,
          itching with dry skin.
          <br>(I do not remember to have seen a case of diphtheria, so-called,
          fairly well defined, but some eruption appeared at some time during
          the disease).
          <br>Lac can. cm., one dose dry, and in forty-eight hours after a dry
          powder of cmm. potency, cured promptly without any other remedy.
          <br>In the use of Lac can. in diphtheria I have observed an
          interesting point&nbsp;: "It was twenty-four hours from the
          appearance to the entire disappearance of the patch in the
          throat" in the original proving.
          <br>In prescribing I was just twenty-four hours before repeating the
          dose or reconsidering the case.
          <br>If no better at end of twenty-four hours, with symptoms still
          pointing to Lac can., I give another powder of a different potency.
          <br>I have thus obtained much more prompt and satisfactory results
          than when the remedy was given in water and repeated every three or
          four hours. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Nichols</font></i>.</p>
