          Dr. Samuel Swan is due the credit of first recognizing the
          possibilities of this substance when potentized, from reading the
          reported successful use of it in the crude form by Donkin, in the
          treatment of diabetes, albuminuria and other affections of the
          kidneys. He potentized it and began the proving on himself and a lady
          patient whom he had cured of a chronic ailment with the m. and cm.
          potencies. Subsequently he induced Dr. Laura Morgan to undertake it,
          who with her friends made extensive provings, and what is remarkable
          is that the genuine character of the original work has not only
          verified many of the claims of Donkin, but nearly every symptom in the
          pathogenesis has been clinically verified, especially the peculiar
          headaches, obstinate constipation and the unusual and irregular
          menses.
          <br>It is well known that the chemical constituents of milk contain an
          epitome of the salts and tissues of the animal which secretes it,
          hence we may conclude that its range of action is co-extensive with
          these tissue salts. Here we find the "mental depression and
          weeping", the "thirst for large quantities and often",
          the "periodical headache increasing and decreasing with the
          sun", the "obstinate constipation and fissure pain" of
          Natrum muriaticum. And so of other salts.
          <br><img alt="Dr Eduard Von GRAUVOGL (1811-1877)" src="./LAC VACCINUM DEFLORATUM. - The Materia Medica of the Nosodes. By Henry Clay ALLEN, M. D._files/grauvo01.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="199" height="239">Grauvogl suggests that hydrogenoid and cold children
          should not be given milk, and Burnett maintains that a milk diet, even
          skimmed milk, after the first year renders them susceptible to colds.
          There is no doubt it prevents nutrition in many persons, both children
          and adults, developing emaciation in some and obesity in others&nbsp;;
          in other words, a constitutional diathesis akin to, or that tends
          toward, the tubercular.
          <br>The deep-seated vein of nervous phenomena manifested in its
          pathogenesis and verified in the care of many obstinate chronic
          ailments warrants a more careful study of this little known and less
          used remedy.</p>

          <br>Bell Barnum, age 13, dark hair&nbsp;: For the last year has had
          severe headache at times, and great pains across the umbilicus&nbsp;;
          also pains passing down the under side of thighs to the heels.
          <br>Pains in the top of feet as if the bones were broken across the
          instep.
          <br>These pains in the legs and feet would come on as soon as she
          stepped upon them in the morning, upon which she would be faint and
          nauseated and have to lie down.
          <br>Would have to lie down three or four times before she could get
          dressed (cured).
          <br>Three or four months after the headache returned, and was again
          cured by Defloratum.
          <br>Judge Martin for years has had a bloating, at times in the
          epigastric region, and with it he would always have an attack of
          asthma, so that he could scarcely breathe&nbsp;; then he would have a
          hard pressive pain at about the fourth cervical vertebra.
          <br>These symptoms were only relieved by taking pills, which would
          cause a free evacuation of the bowels.

          <br>Caroline Betz, German, aged 18&nbsp;; About 7 or 8 P. M. becomes
          so sleepy that she cannot resist and has to lie down about 9 P. M.
          <br>A very hot fever comes on during which she sleeps&nbsp;; the fever
          continues till near morning, when she wakes in a profuse sweat which
          stains the linen yellow and is very difficult to wash out.
          <br>During the day her back usually feels cold&nbsp;; short dry cough
          with difficult expectoration of a small lump of mucus, which relieves
          the cough.
          <br>Irregular menstruation, sometimes very dark and scanty, and
          sometimes colorless water.
          <br>Pimples on face and forehead.
          <br>Nov. 8, gave Deflor. 1 m.
          <br>Was entirely relieved of all the symptoms after the first dose.
