          <br>Introduced and proved by Dr. J. C. Boardman, of Trenton, New
          Jersey, who used Swan's 200th. Many persons are very intolerant of
          milk, in whom it produces headache, "biliousness",
          intestinal flatulence and obstinate constipation. These effects of
          milk were developed in the proving, especially the characteristic
          headache and constipation, and have been clinically verified. It is
          also well to remember that it develops or aggravates the uric acid
          diathesis, thus increasing the rheumatic tendency, while the thirst
          and polyuria should call our attention to it as a remedy to study in
          diabetes.
          <br>In some highly sensitive women the effect on the function of the
          sexual organs is pronounced&nbsp;; the menstrual flow being suppressed
          by putting the hands in cold water&nbsp;; drinking a glass of milk
          will promptly suppress flow until the next period, mark the
          idiosyncrasy. Burnett remarks as a clinical fact that children who
          drink much milk after their teeth are fully grown become very liable
          to colds.
          <br>Like Natrum muriaticum, the potentized remedy will produce its
          characteristic symptoms, even when the prover is using it in the crude
          form at the same time.</p>
