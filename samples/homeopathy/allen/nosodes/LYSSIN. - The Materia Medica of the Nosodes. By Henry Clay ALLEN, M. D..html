          <br><img alt="Dr Constantine HERING (1800-1880)" src="./LYSSIN. - The Materia Medica of the Nosodes. By Henry Clay ALLEN, M. D._files/hering01.jpg" align="left" hspace="5" width="180" height="269">Introduced and proved by Hering in 1833, fifty years
          before the crude experiments of Pasteur with the serum. The toxic or
          non-toxic property of animal saliva has long been a question of
          scientific discussion. Trevinarus found that the human saliva became
          red by the addition of tincture of iron&nbsp;; and Gmelin discovered
          that this color was caused by Sulpho-cyanate. The question in dispute
          appeared to be that Cyanic acid being a poison, Sulpho-cyanate also
          must be one, and or course its combination with alkalies, and being
          poisons, they could not be in the saliva. Years before this discovery,
          Oken had declared that "saliva is poison." But the
          discoveries of Liebig and other chemists have demonstrated that
          Sulpho-cyanic acid is to be found in sheep, dogs and many other
          animals.
          <br>The experiments of Bernard and others, in <i><font color="#0000ff">Virchow's
          Archives</font></i>, 1858, have decided that Sulpho-cyanate of Potash
          found in saliva of animals, acts as a poison under certain conditions.
          Bernard considered that it acted only by application to cellular
          tissue. In this he was, no doubt, in error, being misled by the
          analogy of the snake poison. But, Weir Mitchell in his
          "Researches on the Venom of the Rattlesnake," page 34 says,
          he "could not discover any in the rattlesnake poison,
          notwithstanding repeated experiments."
          <br>Livingstone, the African explorer, has reported the bite of the
          lion as poisonous&nbsp;; and the same claim is made in the East Indies
          regarding the bite of the tiger. From time immemorial it has been
          known in every country village that the bite of an angry cat is
          poisonous, and the effects often severe, even fatal. This is also true
          with the bite of all other animals, human beings included, when in a
          fit of passion.
          <br>Hering reports a case taken from a French journal in which a
          healthy farmer, æt. 19, while holding a duck in his lap was bitten on
          the lip by the angry drake. The same day he felt sick, grew rapidly
          worse, and a few weeks after died. He also says, that "after the
          bite of a dog not rabid difficult healing ulcers will follow." It
          is further known, that after the bite of a rabid dog not only the
          wounds made by the teeth heal in an unsually short time, but several
          physicians have observed that even the usual cauterizations are not
          inclined to inflame, rather more inclined to heal quickly. We may take
          this for a pathognomonic symptom of the slumbering poison of
          Lyssin&nbsp;; the same thing is true of leprosy before it breaks out.
          Now comes the work of Pasteur, in 1878, 1879 and 1880&nbsp;:
          <br>His experiments furnished evidence that the malignant disease,
          splenic fever, was caused by bacteria.
          <br>An animal inoculated with a few drops of a liquid containing this
          bacteria, develops the disease with astonishing rapidity and dies
          within one or two day. But, he claims that chickens are an exception
          to this rule, because when similarly inoculated they remain in perfect
          health. Pasteur's explanation of this strange fact is based on a
          higher bodily temperature of birds than any other warm blooded
          animals. The temperature of animals most readily affected by splenic
          fever ranges from 33 to 35°C., while the blood temperature of
          chickens is from 42 to 43°C degrees. Now, by reducing the temperature
          of the chicken after inoculation, Pasteur found it had died of splenic
          fever, the same as any other animal. Further experiments by Pasteur
          convinced him that propagation of bacteria is arrested by a
          temperature of 44 or more degrees. These facts called Pasteur's
          attention to radiate heat as the best local application to prevent the
          generation of bacteria. And the same principle has been applied in
          domestic practice for the cure of a snakebite by killing a chicken,
          cutting it open and applying the warm surface to the bitten limb,
          replacing it as soon as it became cold by another, and in this way it
          is claimed that on the plains of the West, where the bite of the
          rattlesnake is so common, that nearly every case has been cured&nbsp;;
          the 10 degrees of greater heat seemed to be sufficient in the bite of
          the rattlesnake as well as of the bacteria of splenic fever.
          <br>In June, 1831, Hering published a letter in Stapf's <i><font color="#0000ff">Archives</font></i>, Vol. 10, which was dated June
          18th, 1830, in which he says&nbsp;: "The proving of snake poison
          might pave the way to the prevention of hydrophobia and variola by the
          proving of their respective morbific poisons." And on page 30, of
          the same volume, he says&nbsp;: "Same is said of psora."
          <br>It will be remembered that Hering's immortal proving of Lachesis
          was begun in 1828, and experimented with for three years, when it was
          finally published.
          <br>Hence the experience which Hering obtained in the proving of the
          serpent poison was evidently the inspiration for his suggestion that
          the proving on the healthy of Lyssin, Variolinum, Psorinum and other
          nosodes would form valuable remedies in the treatment of many of our
          obstinate diseases. Hering no sooner became firmly convinced of the
          truth of his suggestion than he at once set to work to put it into
          execution.
          <br>But, the first thing to do was to find a mad dog. The opportunity
          occurred on the 27th of August, 1833, when a German baker invited him
          to come to his house to examine a dog. The following description of
          his capture of a rabid dog and obtaining the saliva for a proving is
          taken from a paper by Hering in the <i><font color="#0000ff">North
          American Journal</font></i>&nbsp;of 1878 :</p>
          <blockquote>
            <font size="2">
            </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">It was a middle-sized, chestnut-brown terrier,
            not more than two or three years old, a female, with puppies of two
            or three months old. It had been bitten ten days before (17th
            August) in the street by a running dog, which was biting all around,
            and had been killed soon afterwards as mad. The owner, in trying to
            save his terrier, had beaten the strange dog with a stick after it
            had killed one of the puppies, and had already taken hold of
            another. The mother, in defending her young ones, had received three
            bloody wounds. She carried the dead one in her mouth from the street
            home into the yard. Since that she was somewhat changed, but
            continued to nurse the remaining puppies, one of which had received
            a bite. She had been otherwise true to her nature until the previous
            day (Aug. 26th), when she had commenced snapping and biting her
            young. The master had then suspected her, and kept her in the yard,
            tied by a rope&nbsp;; and several times she had been biting and
            trying to loosen herself. She soon grew worse and commenced to bite
            at everything. Her voice was entirely altered. On the 26th of
            August, in the evening, she had commenced to howl in a peculiar way
            and to run against the doors. She shook her head a great deal, and
            scraped the ground with her fore feet&nbsp;; and afterwards turned
            her head in a strange way. She put her mouth into the water placed
            before her, as if she was trying to swallow but could not.
            <br>When seen on August 27th she was furious&nbsp;; snapping and
            biting, had a wild look, injected red eyes, frothy saliva around the
            mouth, and seemed evidently to be in the last stage of the disease.
            An empty flour-barrel was, from behind, put over her&nbsp;; and, in
            order to make it possible to secure some of the saliva, the barrel
            was lifted on one side until the dog, in trying to escape, put out
            her head, between the edge of the barrel and the ground. She seemed
            to be in convulsive motions, as from anger or fury&nbsp;; but while
            a quill was used to get as much of the saliva as possible out of her
            mouth and from her teeth (part to be put into milk sugar and part
            into alcohol), the motions lessened and the dog lay quiet and
            exhausted, breathing quick and short, with eyes closed. While the
            quill was still held in her mouth, and while the baker had hold of
            the barrel, the dog suddenly sprang up, snapping and trying to get
            on to its feet&nbsp;; but the owner prevented its escape. After
            enough had been collected, the dog was allowed to withdraw its
            head&nbsp;; and by a heavy weight was secured under the barrel.
            After a box had been prepared, the dog was brought into it by means
            of the rope, and thus transported, with both puppies to my house.
            <br>Next morning the mother was dead, and no permission given by the
            inmates to make a post mortem. Both the young ones were returned to
            the master&nbsp;; and even the bitten one remained well. They were
            given to inhale in the evening some of the 6th centesimal potency,
            just prepared. Of course, a true Hahnemannian never draws his
            conclusions, as the slanderers have said&nbsp;: </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">post hoc ergo propter hoc</font></i><font size="2">, nor even the equally foolish&nbsp;; it followed, but
            could not have been caused by it.
            <br>The saliva obtained in the aforesaid way was on the same day
            triturated&nbsp;; one drop with one hundred grains of milk sugar,
            and, exactly according to Hahnemann's method, carried to the 3d
            centesimal&nbsp;; and, by the aid of some water and alcohol, further
            by alcohol alone, up to the 6th centesimal and later to the 30th.
            <br>From the tincture of the saliva put in alcohol, some weeks
            after, one drop was also potentized in the usual way for the purpose
            of comparative experiments. All the rest, collected on split pieces
            of quill for inoculation, was one night clandestinely taken by the
            lady of the house and thrown into the fire.
            <br>All this has been related in its particulars as an advice to
            others, who may have a chance to get saliva from another dog. It
            might be of some use to get it from a male for comparison.
            <br>Symptoms were observed during the hours of trituration, as there
            had been triturating the Lachesis poison, and they were afterwards
            corroborated by provings with the lower&nbsp;; the very peculiar
            feelings of apprehension became so intolerable that the higher were
            preferred in further provings. Nothing was written for publication
            in the </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">Archives</font></i><font size="2"> until May, 1834. This was printed in the beginning of
            1836, </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">Archives</font></i><font size="2">, 15, I., p. 33.</font></p><font size="2">

          experienced prover, a former engraver, Behlert, by name, at that time
          a paralyzed man) presuaded all his acquaintances, a dozen of wowmen
          and girls, and some boys, to prove this higher preparations. None of
          his provers knew anything of the origin of the drug, and they were
          examined every day with great care, according to the advice of
          Hahnemann.</font>] were added those of John Redmond Cox, in 1853, when
          a suggestion was made that, in order to remove the stigma of cowardice
          in the profession, their shrinking from their first duty of proving
          remedies on themselves was made in a public meeting.
          <br>Dr. Cox not only offered to prove it on himself, but on his entire
          family and his friends besides, and furnished us perhaps the best
          provings that have ever been made of Lyssin&nbsp;; he also furnished
          the day-books in which the symptoms were recorded.
          <br>Many of the most valuable symptoms were from provings by Hering,
          on himself, but he was prevented from continuing by the most terrible
          feelings of apprehension.
          <br>Dr. Knerr made some valuable provings, in 1869, on a woman bitten
          by a dog in the fleshy part of right arm.
          <br>Dr. Lippe cured an important case in which he was guided by a
          symptom produced only from bites, but never observed any provings. But
          Lippe's observation was confirmed by many other good observers. Some
          symptoms from bites of rabid dogs have been added&nbsp;:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <font size="2">
            </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Pasteur's method of administration is very
            different from that employed by homeopaths, but he is working on
            homeopathic lines in seeking to neutralize a virus in the system by
            introducing a modification of the same virus. His experiments led
            him to produce the rabic poison in a highly intensified form in the
            spinal cords of rabbits. He then modified its intensity in different
            degrees by exposure to air for a longer or shorter period. Patients
            who come to the Institute are inoculated first with the least
            potent, and later with the most potent "vaccin", after
            which they are pronounced "cured." The "cure"
            is, however, extremely uncertain, as the degree of susceptibility to
            the poison is unknown in any case, and many hundreds of the patients
            subjected to the inoculations have died of the disease. Pasteur's
            first method was admitted to be too strong, and was soon
            modified&nbsp;; a number of patients having died from the
            inoculations. One of these cases was investigated, and the symptoms
            were sufficiently striking to deserve recording.
            <br>The patient was Arthur Wilde, of Rotherham, aged 29, and I
            received the account from his mother, who nursed him through his
            illness. He had been bitten severely by a man suffering from
            hydrophobia, and was persuaded, much against his wish, to go to
            Pasteur. This he did a few days after the bite, returning on October
            19, 1886, after undergoing the course. On Saturday, October 30th, he
            complained of a pricking sensation below the ribs in the right side,
            in the part where the injections had been made. Pressure relieved
            the pain somewhat. That evening he vomited and the vomiting
            continued, and he became very prostrate. On Monday the prostration
            was intense, vomiting continued, restless&nbsp;; skin cool,
            perspiring&nbsp;; quite conscious. The spots where the inoculations
            were made were dark and livid. Twitching occurred every few hours,
            sometimes more violently than others&nbsp;; most marked on the
            abdomen. From Monday through Tuesday he was making a peculiar loud
            noise, something like a waggoner driving horse, "bis",
            "whoo", though he had never had to do with horses. He
            seemed completely helpless. On Tuesday night vomiting ceased and he
            began to froth a great deal. Early on Wednesday morning he began to
            talk thick. His breathing, which had been peculiar all through he
            would hold his breath for a long time when making the noise, and
            then breathe rapidly for a few breaths became very bad at 3 A. M. on
            Wednesday. He died shortly after 12, having been apparently
            conscious to the end, though unable to speak for the last hour. The
            frothing had increased up to the time of his death and he seemed to
            choke with it.
            <br>This case was paralleled by that of Goffi, and attendant at St.
            Thomas' Hospital, who was bitten by a cat and sent to Pasteur. On
            his return he was taken ill&nbsp;; and his case was at first
            diagnosed as Landry's paralysis, but finally proved (by experiments
            made with his spinal cord) to be "paralytic rabies", the
            result of inoculation. It was after the occurrence of these and
            similar "accidents" that the intensity of the
            "vaccines" was reduced. - </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">Clarke</font></i><font size="2">.</font></p><font size="2">

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Thus, nearly fifty years after the experiments of
          Hering with the virus of hydrophobia. Pasteur's work began. But, on
          account of the crude preparation, like Koch's experiments with
          Tuberculin, many of Pasteur's cases were fatal. No better illustration
          can be found in medicine of the scientific accuracy and its successful
          clinical demonstration than is to be had in the results of the labors
          of these two men. The homeopathic methods have been demonstrated to be

            doctor in attendance, cut from a hedge of the plant with which the
            hospital grounds were fenced. To the astonishment of all, the boy
            reached for it and ate it greedily, almost without chewing. By
            evening a decrease in the violence of the nervous attacks was
            manifest, though they remained as frequent as before. The
            improvement was slow but continued. On the fourth day he took some
            nourishment, but also continued chewing Agave and swallowing the
            juice. On the fifth day he recovered consciousness, but still
            demanded Agave. On the eighth day he said he did not want any more,
