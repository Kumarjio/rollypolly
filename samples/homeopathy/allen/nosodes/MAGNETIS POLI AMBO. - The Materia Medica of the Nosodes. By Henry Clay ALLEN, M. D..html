          <br>Symptoms produced by touching either pole of the magnet,
          indiscriminately, or by laying the whole of the magnetic surface upon
          the body. The potencies have been prepared by triturating milk sugar
          which had been saturated when exposed to the emanations of the magnet,
          a method Hahnemann does not appear to have practiced.
          <br>The pathogenesis of the magnet as a whole, and of each pole
          separately, is from Hahnemann's Materia Medica Pura. It is to the
          original provings and observations of Hahnemann that we owe these
          valuable remedies, and no better or more logical introduction perhaps
          can be given than he has furnished in the Materia Medica Pura&nbsp;:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <font size="2">
            </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">To the ordinary mechanical, materialistic, and
            atomistic heads -and there is a vast number of such- it seemed not
            only paradoxical, but childish and incredible, that, according to
            the homeopathic medical doctrine, the administration of doses of
            only very minute fractions of a grain of the more powerful medicines
            could be of use.
            <br>I grant that it may certainly be </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">more convenient</font></i><font size="2"> to regard
            all diseases as accumulations of gross impurities, and active drugs
            as rough levers and brooms, or as chemical reagents, consequently as
            palpable things. This may, I repeat, be </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">more convenient</font></i><font size="2"> than to
            regard those alterations of the being of living creatures (disease)
            as pure dynamical affections of the vital force, and medicines as
            pure, virtual, tone-altering powers, as they are in reality, and to
            set about curing according to these views.
            <br>If we do not adopt these true views, but adhere to those
            ordinary material ones, the curative powers of medicine must be
            estimated according to their bulk and the weight of their
            dose&nbsp;; and hence the scales must determine the efficacy of the
            dose. But in that case we must first ascertain the weight of the
            disease, in order to be able to reckon whether a disease weighing so
            many pounds (it has, indeed, been hitherto not unusual to employ the
            phrase "</font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">grave</font></i><font size="2"> illness") could be pried out, as with a lever, by
            such weight of medicine.
            <br>I willingly abandon to those colleagues of mine such atomistic
            views, by which the business of treatment can be carried on very
            comfortably, even when half asleep&nbsp;; for, as we all know, to us
            poor mortals nothing is more easy of comprehension than the
            material, ponderable, palpable, and sensible, because much thinking
            (and observing), as an Isrælitish teacher says, in a weariness to
            the body. I cannot suppose them capable of regarding disease as
            immaterial alterations of the vitality, as pure dynamic derangements
            of our state of health, and medicinal powers as mere virtual, almost
            spiritual, forces. It is impossible to disabuse them of the idea
            that for such and such a grave disease a dose of medicine of such
            and such a weight is required, seeing that they could point to the
            traditional practice of thousands of years, when palpable quantities
            of medicine must always be poured into the patient from large
            bottles, pots, and boxes, in order that any effect should be
            produced in serious diseases, and </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">yet even this did not usually succeed</font></i><font size="2">. I can readily believe this&nbsp;; the effect of the
            ordinary treatment of all times fully corroborates it. But how can
            they reconcile it with the atomistic, materialistic notions they
            entertain respecting the action of medicines and their curative
            powers, that a single </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">imponderable</font></i><font size="2"> spark from a Leyden jar gives a shock to the strongest
            man, and yet no ascertainable ponderable substance is communicated
            to his body&nbsp;? How can they reconcile with their atomistic
            materialistic notions the enormous power of mesmerism, when a
            powerful man with a strong will to do good </font><i><font size="2" color="#0000ff">approaches</font></i><font size="2"> the point of
            his thumb to the pit of the stomach of a nervous patient&nbsp;? How
            can they, finally, reconcile with their atomistic, materialistic
            notions respecting the actions of medicines the fact that a
            carefully-constructed magnetic steel rod can effect such a powerful
            derangement of our health, even when it is not in actual contact
            with the body, but may even be covered with some thick material
            (such as cloth, bladder, glass, etc.), so that we suffer therefrom
            violent morbid affections&nbsp;; or what is equally remarkable, that
            a magnetic rod can quickly and permanently cure the most severe
            disease for which it is a suitable medicine, when it is brought near
            the body, for but a short time, even though covered as above
            described&nbsp;? Atomist&nbsp;! you narrow-minded wiseacre&nbsp;!
            tell me what ponderable quantity of the magnet entered the body in
            order to effect these often enormous changes in its state of
            health&nbsp;? Is not the centillionth of a grain (a fraction of a
            grain that has 600 ciphers for its denominator) still infinitely too
            heavy to represent this absolutely imponderable quantity, the kind
            of spirit that emanated from the magnetic rod into this living
            body&nbsp;? Will you now continue to express your amazement at the
            homœopathic doses of powerful medicines of the sextillionth,
            octillionth, the decillionth of a grain, which are gross weights
            compared with this invisible magnetic power&nbsp;?
            <br>The subjoined symptoms occurred from various powerful magnets
            brought in contact with various sensitive individuals, without
            distinction of the poles. They were observed in experiments
            conducted for half a year for the purpose of ascertaining the proper
            and most efficacious mode of stroking the steel with magnets, in
            which a horse-shoe magnet capable of lifting twelve pounds was held
            in the hands, which were in contact with both poles for an hour at a
            time.</font></p><font size="2">
