          <br>Mr. C. suffered two years from an inverted toe-nail&nbsp;; had
          tried three of the best physicians and an endless variety of remedies
          without any relief. About a year ago he submitted to the painful
          operation of having his nail pulled out by the root, but in three
          months it grew in and troubled him more than before. He took <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnetis Australis 1m</font></i>, and in about five
          weeks was entirely cured. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Swan</font></i>.
          <br>Mrs. D., nervo-sanguine temperament, has suffered for five years
          from an ingrowing toe-nail, outer side of left great toe. During most
          of this time she has not been able to wear a shoe on this foot and
          never without greatly increasing the pain or even bear the weight of
          the body on it. Any misstep would be followed by a discharge of blood
          and pus. The outer side of toe was very much inflamed and swollen, so
          that nearly half the nail was hidden. No treatment, even cutting out
          half the nail, gave more than temporary relief. One drop of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnetis Australis 1m</font></i> was given. Relief
          soon followed. The toe looked better, was less sensitive to pressure,
          and she could wear her boot without causing much pain. The swelling
          had nearly disappeared at the root of the nail, giving the appearance
          of a piece having been cut out. Gave three doses of the same remedy,
          one every night, and in a few days the toe was perfectly well. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Ballard</font></i>.

          of left great toe to grow over the corner of nail. Through neglect and
          injudicious local medication, ulceration and large unhealthy
