          <br>The crusts vary in form and character, and the appearance differs
          as much in animals as many skin diseases of the same family do in the
          human. Dr. W. P. Wesselhoeft reports a case in which&nbsp;: "The
          crust assumed a conical form&nbsp;; a thick layer of crusts, if
          allowed to remain without removal, heaped up one-half an inch. They
          were fragile, moist, yellow, about the consistency of honey-comb. When
          removed a raw surface remained with deep fissures and thick crusts
          reformed into their original size in 48 hours. There was evidently no
          itching, but some soreness after removal of the scabs."
          <br>These crusts resemble forms of eczema and rupia.
          <br>From Jenner we have it that the origin of cowpox is infection of
          the udders of cows by contact with grass, on which a horse infected
          with grease has trodden&nbsp;; While the other historical origin from
          a similar source of infection, also from Jenner, is that it was from
          the unwashed hands of the stable neys who milked the cows after
          grooming the horses infected with grease. These assertions are to some
          extent confirmed by the clinical experience of many homeopaths, who
          have successfully used Malandrinum against infection with smallpox,
          and for the bad effects of vaccination.
          <br>John H. Clarke says&nbsp;: "It has been used on inferential
          grounds with great success in bad effects of vaccination. I have cured
          with it cases of unhealthy dry, rough skin remaining for years after
          vaccination&nbsp;; in small-pox, measles and impetigo."
          <br>Burnett cured with it a case of knock-knee in a child who was
          constantly handling his penis. His indications are&nbsp;: "Lower
          half of body affected, greasy skin and greasy eruption. Slow
          pustulation never ending, as one heals another appears."
          <br>For the bad effects from vaccination&nbsp;: The late Dr. Fellger,
          of Philadelphia, probably had a more extensive experience in treating
          variola and the effects of vaccination than any other man of his time.
          He had given much thought and many years of study to the subject and
          came to rely almost wholly upon Malandrinum as a prophylactic for
          variola, and as the therapeutic remedy in acute cases. He used
          Malandrinum for confluent small-pox with great success. Where the skin
          has an unnatural color between the pustules, and small-pox takes on
          the confluent form, it is always serious and often dangerous. When the
          eyeball becomes congested and red, it enables the physician to
          prognose danger.
          <br>Dr. Boskowitz, of Brooklyn, was the first to introduce and use
          Malandrinum. He made the first potencies up to the 30th from the
          crusts of the "grease of the horse." To the observations of
          Dr. Boskowitz in the use of this remedy, both as a prophylactic and
          therapeutic remedy against small-pox and the bad effects of
          vaccination, are added those of Drs. Raue, Carletan Smith, Wm.
          Jefferson Guernsey, Selfridge, Wesselhoeft, Burnett and Clarke. The
          potencies of Boericke and Tafel were obtained from Dr. Raue&nbsp;;
          those of Fincke, Swan and Smith, of New York, came direct from Dr.
          Boskowitz. It is needless to add that these original preparations were
          hand-made, but we believe all are reliable. The remedy has had an
          extensive proving by W. P. Wesselhoeft, H. C. Allen, Steere Holcombe
          and students of Hering College, in 1900 and 1901. The provings were
          made with potencies ranging from the 30th and 35th to the 200th. No
          prover knew what was being taken.
          <br>We consider it a deep, long-acting remedy, to be repeated not
          oftener than once a fortnight.
          <br>Impetigo, ecthyma&nbsp;; fat, greasy looking pustular eruptions
          are especially affected by this remedy. A. L. Marcy, H. R. Vol. XIV.
          p. 530, relates a singular experience with Malandrinum 30. During a
          small-pox epidemic he vaccinated himself, taking at the same time
          Malandrinum 30 night and morning. The vaccination did not take. It was
          twice repeated and still did not take, nor was small-pox contracted.
          Called to vaccinate four children in a family whose parents had
          small-pox, he vaccinated all and gave Malandrinum 30 to three of them
          at the same time&nbsp;; the remaining child was the only one whole
          vaccination "took." This was so severe that Malandrinum had
          to be given to modify its intensity, which it did effectually. The
          other three were re-vaccinated but none "took." Of five
          children from six to seventeen years of age, only the eldest had been
          vaccinated, and he had a good scar. All except the eldest were given
          Malandrinum and were vaccinated and none of the four "took."
          The eldest took small-pox. Malandrinum was then given, and in a few
          days he was convalescent. In another case of small-pox Malandrinum was
          given, and the disease only lasted a few days, the eruption drying up.
          <br>The only previous attempt at proving was made by Straube with the
          30th potency, published in the H. R. Vol. XV, p. 145, and the H. W.
          Vol. XXXV, p. 504. These symptoms are included.</p>

          <br>Dec. 6, 1905. Took fifteen pellets of the 35th potency at 10 P. M.
          <br>Before eleven o'clock began to feel a creepy sensation in my skin,
          particularly in the face, like the crawling of ants over it,
          accompanied by itching.
          <br>It was red, and I had to resist a desire to jerk my fingers and
          twist my hands&nbsp;; this continued and increased even after I had
          taken my warm bath.
          <br>Went to bed about twelve very sleepy, but could not get to sleep
          because I could not lie still on account of creepy sensation which
          spread over my arms, shoulders and upper part of my body, with jerking
          of the limbs.
          <br>I turned from one side to the other, but could not be quiet long
          enough to get to sleep.
          <br>Accompanying this was a ringing in my head, as it once had when
          years ago I had taken quinine, but it was not of long duration.
          <br>At half-past one I got up and wrote this. My lower limbs did not
          seem to be affected by any of these sensations, but I kept scratching
          my arms and face, head and shoulders, and my hands and fingers felt
          particularly restless and nervous. Had no internal disturbance other
          than my head. Finally fell asleep at half-past two and slept soundly
          until six.
          <br>Dec. 7. Awoke with all the symptoms of the night before gone, but
          had a sharp headache, and a bad taste in my mouth. By seven o'clock
          these too were gone, and I arose feeling all right.
          <br>While I was out walking I was taken with a severe pain in the
          back, or rather, at the left side of the sacrum low down, with
          stitching pains in rectum. It lasted about an hour.
          <br>At two o'clock began to have a bad headache over eyes, and with a
          sense of fullness in my head.
          <br>My feet were somewhat swollen when I put on my boots in the early
          morning, but by twelve o'clock after walking (not without some pain)
          the swelling left. By half-past three in the afternoon my headache was
          entirely gone (it lasted only one and a half hours), also the sense of
          fullness in the head. Have felt perfectly well ever since until Friday
          morning.
          <br>Dec. 8. About eleven o'clock when I suddenly had another attack of
          headache, and I find that I am liable to a return of these attacks,
          with the sense of fullness, at odd times, apparently without any
          reason.
          <br>Friday had three attacks, but they did not last long&nbsp;; from
          half an hour to an hour and a half, not longer, also since Wednesday
          evening, when I took the pills, until Friday night, Dec. 8th, I have
          not had any discharge from my bowels.
          <br>Dec. 9. When I went to bed last night, after lying down, my head
          had a sharp pain for perhaps ten minutes. This morning when I woke I
          had that disagreeable taste in my mouth, but felt all right until
          about 9 o'clock, when I went out, and I did not have any vitality, and
          found it hard work to lift my legs. I thought it might come from not
          taking coffee (which you have asked me not to do during the proving),
          as I have done for so long a time, so I went and had some rolls and
          omelet and drank a cup of weak tea, but did not feel any better. My
          movements seemed to be uncertain. I was afraid of falling, or
          tripping. It was difficult work getting in and out of the ears. I had
          occasion to go up two flights of stairs, very old, narrow and rickety,
          and was afraid that I should fall on my way down.
          <br>I have had all day, not a headache, but a feeling that made me
          scowl, and keep closing my eyes. I felt as if I must get home as soon
          as possible.
          <br>For two days, several times, I have been troubled by feeling very
          hot in the face&nbsp;; never cold, Sometimes when the face felt
          burning hot I would perspire on the face and head.
          <br>This morning I had a movement of the bowels, the first since

          <br>I have been troubled a great deal with rheumatism in my hand, the
          right one, and thigh and hip, although the pain was not constant, but
          since taking the pellets on Wednesday last, I have not had any pain of
          this kind anywhere. I have had a slight eruption on my cheeks and
          sometimes a place larger than a dollar would be burning red and
          shining on my right cheek at the side of my nose.
          <br>Sunday, Dec. 10. No symptoms today until now, 7 P. M., both cheeks
          are burning and have the inflamed shiny look. Perhaps it is also
          another symptom that I have been very irritable all day.
          <br>Dec. 11. The rheumatism has returned in right hand and hip. After
          I have been walking a very short distance, my legs pain me and get so
          heavy and my back and hips drag so that I have to sit down, and when I
          sit down, all these feelings go away. Two or three times today my
          right eyelids has kept twitching.
          <br>Tuesday, Dec. 12. Twitching in left eye only. Same trouble in my
          hips and legs and back, when walking. My stomach and abdomen have been
          much swollen for two days.
          <br>Wednesday, Dec. 13. Nothing more.
          <br>Thursday, Dec. 14. Nothing.
          <br>Dec. 17. Took two hundredth potency in solution at eleven o'clock
          P. M. A tablespoonful of twenty pellets dissolved in four
          tablespoonfuls of water.
          <br>At 12:30 A. M., my skin began to itch and my legs were very
          fidgety, also all my body was very restless. Arms and shoulders were
          not affected as before, however, with itching and restlessness. It
          seemed to be the lower part of my body this time, although my face
          felt some of the irritation, but in a much less degree.
          <br>Monday, Dec. 18, 7:30 A. M. Slept soundly from 12:30 to 7:30 this
          morning, with all the symptoms of the night before gone on awaking.
          <br>At 4 P. M. began to have excruciating pain in my forehead over the
          left eye, which continued until about midnight. Once it ran down
          behind my left ear for a short while.
          <br>It left me as suddenly as it came. Took the last tablespoonful
          that night. Slept well without disturbance.
          <br>Dec. 19. That day was without pain or other disturbances, except I
          felt in a state of collapse nearly all day. Had no strength in my arms
          or legs, and every little while was obliged to lie down wherever I
          happened to be. Would almost fall asleep and my breathing was very
          deep and heavy, like puffing. My body felt heavy, and I had difficulty
          in lifting my legs and walking. Frequently low sighs would come. This
          was all much better by 6 P. M.
          <br>While taking the medicine this time, I have had no operation of
          the bowels, and the last day there was more or less of an eruption on
          my cheeks and at the side of the nose, but not the red shiny look I
          had when taking the remedy the first time in pills (the 35th).
          <br>Each time I took the medicine (the first time in pellets and this
          time in solution) I had a slight return of the breaking out round my
          waist which I had when afflicted with shingles years ago. I was not
          rheumatically affected this time as I seemed to be when I first took
          the pills. Ever since I began taking the pills, from the first day
          until now, I have found that when I started out walking, however well
          I felt, after a short time I gave out all over, and especially in my
          bowels, thighs and legs, also the toes of my left foot, except the big
          toe, were affected in a way I never before felt, not like cramp or
          gout&nbsp;; and whereas I am always light on my feet and move quickly
          and easily, during these days it has been hard for me to get about and
          I have felt heavy and moved heavily, also a great deal of headache, a
          thing unusual for me&nbsp;; also often a shortness of breath with an
          inclination to wheeze.
          <br>Dec. 20th, 7 A. M. Woke with a bad headache (the bad taste which I
          had in my mouth when waking while I was taking the medicine in pellets
          (35th) I have not had at all this time). Since December 20th I have
          had no more symptoms.
          <br>Mrs. J. F. C., aged 62&nbsp;; a large well developed woman, gray
          hair, former blonde, born in England, and has lived for twenty years
          in Munich, Germany.
          <br>May 8, 1900. Has always been remarkably well until eight years ago
          when an eruption appeared on the upper lip, which formed a yellowish,
          honeycombed crust. Portions would crumble off and leave a moist
          surface, which again would form a similar crust&nbsp;; occasionally a
          burning and, at long intervals, sharp stabbing pains through the upper
          lip.
          <br>Had received all kinds of external treatments by German
          specialists, without effect. Once after cautery, it remained absent
          for six months. Then Dr. Jochner, of Munich, advised surgical
          interference, which was not acceded to. On her return to America,
          further local experiments were tried without success.
          <br>I could not elicit any symptoms of a constitutional character.
          Neither could I establish any connection with vaccination, or
          revaccination, as she told me she had never been revaccinated since
          childhood, which is a remarkable record for a life in Germany of
          twenty years.
          <br>The appearance was so unsightly that she had excluded herself
          largely from contact with society and was consequently mentally much
          depressed and anxious. From May 8th until February, 1901, she received
          at long intervals of at least three weeks single doses of Sulphur.
          Arsenic and Kali carb. The latter remedy was given June 20th, 1900,
          and some improvement was noticed until February, 1901, during which
          time she was under placebo, when she reappeared with the condition as
          bad as ever.
          <br>The character of the eruption reminding me so strongly in
          appearance of the "scratches" of horses, led me to give her
          one dose of Malandrinum 24m., on February 5th, 1901.
          <br>April 1st. There was on the whole a decided change in the diameter
          and elevation of the crust, but still there existed the sticky
          moisture under it. Repeated Malandrinum 24m., and placebo, with slight
          improvement. On April 27 she received Malandrinum cm., with gradual
          improvement during May and June.
          <br>July 15. The crust had decreased one-half, but still moisture
          underneath it, Malandrinum cm.
          <br>October 26th. She reappeared with an entirely clear lip, which has
          remained so to this date, Dec. 11, 1906.
          <br>Miss M. N. H., aged 19, medium brunette. Student.
          <br>Dec. 27, 1904. Eruptions first appeared three years ago on chest
          and back. Small pimples with intense itching, extending to other parts
          of the body and limbs&nbsp;; &lt; when exposed to air and on
          undressing.
          <br>For the last two months a different form of eruption has appeared
          on face, a very unsightly crust of a light yellowish-gray color, on
          right side of forehead extending to the temple and under the hair on
          that side. Has used external medicinal applications more or less for
          the last three years without benefit. There is some irritation and
          itching of the eruption on the forehead, but less intense than that on
          the body.
          <br>Complaints of faint, gone sensations in stomach without real
          hunger. This is especially evident since the previous July, and is not
          &gt; by eating. All functions normal.
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Was vaccinated repeatedly before her
          twelfth year. In that year the vaccination "took", followed
          by a tedious suppuration at the point of vaccination.</font></i>
          <br>Sulphur cm. in water to be taken during forty-eight hours a
          tablespoonful morning and evening.
          <br>Jan. 21, 1905. Has more eruption and more intense itching. No
          faintness. Appetite rather abnormal, craves hearty food. Psorinum cm.
          in water, morning and evening for two days.
          <br>Feb. 18. Itching continues intense. Eruption has appeared in
          popliteal space and hollow of elbows. Thinks there is less moisture
          after scratching. Placebo.
          <br>March 15. No improvement whatever. All symptoms remain the same,
          except the faintness at the stomach disappeared. Malandrinum 24m., one
          dose dry.
          <br>April 15. Eruption on forehead appears to be less thick, but
          itching remains intense. Malandrinum 24m., one dose dry.
          <br>May 13. Decidedly less itching&nbsp;; less moisture, both on face
          and body. Chief discomfort on forehead. Crust less thick. Malandrinum
          24m., one dose dry.
          <br>June 12. Decidedly better. Placebo.
          <br>July 10. Most marked improvement. Forehead entirely free from the
          crust, and all eruption. Skin normal, where the large crust was
          located. Eruption on body also much improved&nbsp;; no itching.
          Hollows of elbows and knees clear of eruption.
          <br>Dec. 9. Has been free from eruption all summer. Since the cold
          weather slight reappearance on forehead and neck, but no crust small
          pimples with some itching. Says her hair is falling out. Malandrinum
          24m., one dose dry.
          <br>March 10. No eruption anywhere. Skin of body normal. No itching.
          No falling of hair.
          <br>In November, 1906, received letter from a relative, who reports
          her as perfectly well, and the happiest girl in her town. Miss G. W.,
          aged 40, light blonde, full habit, very healthy. Dec. 6th.
          <br>Ten pellets, 38th potency, at 12 M. Wednesday. While sitting at
          lunch at 2 o'clock momentary light-headedness lasting perhaps two
          minutes.
          <br>Friday, 8th. Woke at 4 A. M., attack of sinking weakness&nbsp;;
          rose and walked about the room a few minutes&nbsp;; was chilly for
          half an hour after returning to bed.
          <br>Monday, 11th. All day nausea, &gt; after eating, uncertain, shaky
          feeling in stomach.
          <br>Tuesday, 12th. Same nausea continued &lt; afternoon, with <i><font color="#0000ff">dull headache in forehead</font></i>.
          <br>After dinner at 7 o'clock nausea with eructations tasting of food.
          <br>Wednesday, 13th. Slept from 11 till 4 A. M., then an attack of
          eructation of gas tasting of food&nbsp;; no nausea to-day&nbsp;; took
          cup of coffee this morning, which relieved nausea.
          <br>Feels week and exhausted all over.
          <br>Has felt so ill that she declines to take more of the medicine,
          and begged me, with tears in her eyes, not to give her any more, as
          she knew she would have "nervous exhaustion", which she had
          during a whole year, four years ago.</p>
