          <br>We are indebted to the late G. W. Bowen, Fort Wayne. Ind., for
          this valuable remedy.
          <br>Hahnemann had an extensive experience in Malarial Fevers in the
          valleys of the Danube and the fevers of the Pontine marshes on the
          Tiber are historical.
          <br>Dr. Bowen lived on the Wabash River at that time, a noted malarial
          region, and for many years he was called upon to treat hundreds of
          patients suffering from all forms of malarial affections.
          <br>Malarial affections have been attributed to marsh exhalation in
          summer and autumn when the water has been evaporated by heat. These
          poison vapors of decaying vegetation Dr. Bowen had to contend with,
          Malarial fevers and their resultant diseases, intermittent, remittent,
          continued, typhoid, etc., for years, not only in their acute, but in
          their suppressed forms, in which he found all forms of chronic
          diseases, very frequently, could be traced to maltreatment of the
          acute manifestation. He conceived the practicability of testing the
          effects of artificial toxin prepared from peat, or decayed vegetable
          matter, taken from a marsh during the dry season, when the malaria
          toxin was most active. This vegetable matter was placed in glass jars,
          filled with water and allowed to decompose, which were numbered I, II,
          and III, according to the time, one, two or three weeks of
          decomposition.
          <br>At the end of each period, or stage, provings were made by
          inhaling the gases given off just as the patient would naturally
          inhale the marsh miasm. Provers were paid so much per day to inhale
          the gas in its different stages of decomposition, and a careful record
          of its effects was made. This constituted the provings of the crude
          gases.
          <br>For medicinal purposes a tincture was prepared by putting ten
          drops of No. II, in which the matter had been decomposed for two
          weeks, into 90 drops of alcohol&nbsp;; this formed the 1st dec.
          potency and all Bowen's reported cures were treated with this.
          <br>Boericke Tafel made a 30th from this tincture, which Yingling
          inhaled, and resulted in his involuntary proving. Later Boericke Tafel
          made a 30th potency of No. III, which was run up into the higher
          potencies by Gorton, and used by Yingling in his clinical experiences.
          <br>The paid provers of No. 1, which was not very offensive, obtained
          the following uniform results in from one to three hours after
          inhalation&nbsp;: "Headache, nausea, distressed stomach,
          white-coated tongue." These symptoms passed off in two or three
          days.
          <br>Provers of No. II obtained results in from twelve to twenty-four
          hours, which were much more severe and long lasting. They were&nbsp;:
          "Fearful headache, nausea, vomiting in some cases, aversion to
          food, distress in stomach, hypochondria, first in the spleen, then,
          the liver and stomach, and on the third day pronounced chills, which
          were so severe that they had to be antidoted."
          <br>No. III, which was "fetid to a fearful degree", produced
          little result except nausea within three or four days, but then
          symptoms began to appear&nbsp;; first, extreme lassitude, chills and
          fever, pains and aches, impeding locomotion.
          <br>When taken internally the results were much more severe&nbsp;: No.
          I caused bilious colic, nausea, cramps, headache.
          <br>No. II, the stomach, liver, spleen and kidneys became involved,
          with quartan or tertian intermittent fevers.
          <br>No. III setting up a more profound type even, a genuine typhoid or
          semi-paralytic state, which compelled the provers to take to bed.
          <br>On the day I received from Boericke Tafel Malaria off. 30 I was
          foolishly led to try Hahnemann's inhalation. The thought just occurred
          to me on the spur of the moment, and without stopping to think I took
          three strong inhalations, with both sorrow and a proving resulting.
          None of the symptoms were distressing yet marked and clear cut. The
          remedy commenced its work promptly and in the order following&nbsp;:
          <br>Aching in both elbows.
          <br>A kind of slight concentration of feeling in root of nose and just
          above, as though I have a severe cold, similar to that complained of
          by hay-fever patients.
          <br>Aching in wrists.
          <br>A tired ache in hands.
          <br>A tired ache in knees, and for a distance above and below.

          <br>Itching on right cheek over malar bone&nbsp;; &gt; by slight
          rubbing or scratching.
          <br>When leaning face on left hand, elbow on the table, perceptible
          feeling of the heart beats through upper body and neck.
          <br>Slight itching on various parts of the face and extremities&nbsp;;
          &gt; by slight rubbing.
          <br>Sense of heat in abdomen.
          <br>Chilly sensation in left forearm. Soon followed by chilly feeling
          in hands and fingers&nbsp;; feet are cold with sensation as if
          chilliness was about to creep up the legs. A few moments later knees
          feel cold. A sense of coldness ascending over body from the legs.
          <br>Arms feel tired.
          <br>Belching several times, easy&nbsp;; no taste.
          <br>A drawing pain in right external ear.
          <br>Lumbar back feels tired as though it would ache.
          <br>Neck feels tired, with slight cracking in upper part on moving the
          head.
          <br>Shallow breathing which seems from languor, with a desire to take
          a deep inspiration occasionally.
          <br>A kind of tired feeling through abdomen and chest.
          <br>A general sense of weariness.
          <br>A feeling about head as though I would become dizzy.
          <br>Pain in upper left teeth.
          <br>A sensation as though I would have a very loose stool (passed away
          without stool).
          <br>Feeling rather stupid and sleepy.
          <br>A sensation in the spleen as though it would ache.
          <br>Saliva more profuse than usual&nbsp;; keeps me swallowing often.
          <br>Pain in abdomen to right of navel.
          <br>Dull aching through forehead.
          <br>Face feels warm, as if flushed, also head&nbsp;; becomes general
          over body, as if feverish.
          <br>Aching across upper sacral region.
          <br>Legs very weary from short walk.
          <br>Pain at upper part of right ilium.
          <br>General sense of weariness from a very short walk, especially
          through pelvis, sacral region and upper thighs.
          <br>I feel strongly inclined to lie down and rest.
          <br>Qualmishness of stomach, as though I should become nauseated.
          <br>General sense of malaise and weariness becoming quite marked.
          <br>Aching above inner angle of right eye.
          <br>A kind of simmering all through the body.
          <br>Felt impelled to lie down, and on falling to sleep a sense of
          waving dizziness passes all over me, preventing sleep.
          <br>At times I feel as though I should become cold or have a chill,
          then I feel as though I should become feverish or hot, though neither
          is very marked.
          <br>Eyes feel heavy and sleepy.
          <br>Uneasiness in lower abdomen.
          <br>Gaping, yawning and desire to stretch.
          <br>Legs are restless&nbsp;; feel like stretching and moving them.
          <br>I feel very much as I did one time before having the ague,
          twenty-five years ago.
          <br>Odor from cooking is pleasing, but I have no desire for dinner.
          <br>Yet when I sit down I eat a good dinner with relish.
          <br>Dizziness on rising from a reclining position.
          <br>Feel generally better after eating dinner.
          <br>Aching in occiput.
          <br>During the afternoon leg weary.
          <br>Unusual hearty appetite for supper (the good appetite keeps with
          me for some days).
          <br>A good night's rest following, and have felt much brighter and
          generally better ever since the first day (Healing).
          <br>"I know several localities in South America, Africa and Spain
          where the marsh miasma has unquestionably arrested and cured that
          fatal scourge of the human race, phthisis pulmonalis, without any
          other treatment or restriction in food or drink.
          <br>And why should not the climate of the fen lands of Lincolnshire,
          in the neighborhood of Spalding, prove as curative an agent for this
          disease as the climate of so many foreign regions where patients go
          and die, deprived of all the comforts of home&nbsp;? Penzance, among
          the British localities, is reported to be superior to nine-tenths of
          the places to which patients are sent.
          <br>Penzance, then, and Spalding should be particularly studied by
          medical men and recommended to consumptive individuals who wish to
          enjoy the benefits and advantages of a national place of relief, if
          not of cure."</p>

          <br>In one week she could walk as well as ever and has no rheumatism

          <br>Mr. S., foreman of a large saw mill, has been afflicted with
          rheumatism for years, stiff neck and right arm and shoulder helpless
          and painful.
          <br>He wished to keep it from his chest and heart.
          <br>Malaria 1x every two hours, when better every three hours.
          <br>In three days he was better and could turn his neck and use his
          arm fairly well.
          <br>One week later gave him two drachms more of Malaria, to be taken
          six hours apart.
          <br>He has not had any rheumatic troubles since that time.
          <br>Mr. C., proprietor of two large saw mills, one in Arkansas, where
          he passes part of his time (and frequently gets wet), has been
          afflicted with so-called gout.
          <br>I found it was of rheumatic nature (caused by malaria) and made
          &lt; by Quinine and external applications, I gave him Malaria 1x.
          <br>In three days he was better and did not have half as many pains or
          aches.

          <br>After repairing his heart, chest, stomach, curing his piles and
          regulating his bowels he was content, yet he could not walk.
          <br>His back had been injured in the army, and his limbs would not
          move at will and he could not walk alone or get out of a chair.
          <br>I gave him for a week Ruta graveolens and Rhus. tox., of each the
          first cent., three hours apart.
          <br>This &gt; for a time.
