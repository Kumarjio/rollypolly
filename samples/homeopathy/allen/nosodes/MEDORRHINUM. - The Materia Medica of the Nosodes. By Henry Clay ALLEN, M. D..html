          made from the gonorrheal virus. There are two preparations&nbsp;; the
          acute and chronic. From the virus of the acute stage to the chronic,
          or gleet stage, both of which are supposed to contain the gonococcus.
          <br>Introduced by Swan.
          <br>Provings by Swan, Ren Dell, C. H. Allen, Finch, Norton, Frost,
          Farrington, Cleveland, Laura Morgan, Berridge, Wilder, Higgins,
          Ostrom, Nichols, Peace, Sawyer, Carr. Bigler. Macdonald, in Great
          Britain, and Noegerath and Lydston, in American, have published fatal
          cases, and the effects of the poison. The symptoms produced by the
          virus in acute cases have been included in the pathogenesis, just as
          the toxic symptoms of Arsenic, Mercurius, Opium and Plumbum are
          included in the pathogenesis. The potentizing of the virus has
          developed latent dynamic forces, which is just as effective in
          homeopathic practice, prescribed strictly on its symptomatological
          basis as any other remedy. If the symptoms of the patient call for
          this remedy it should be prescribed with the same confidence as any
          other in the Materia Medica, entirely irrespective of the sycotic
          history in the case. Like every other nosode, it should be prescribed
          according to its strict indications, just as we prescribe Arsenic,
          Opium or Sulphur, irrespective of its origin or the diagnosis.
          <br>We append the following graphic description on the effects
          of&nbsp;:</p>

          <br>Difficulty in concentrating his thoughts or mind on abstract

          <br>Could not read or use mind at all from pain in head.
          <br>Thinks some one is behind her, hears whispering&nbsp;; sees faces
          that peer at her from behind bed and furniture.
          <br>Persons come in, look at her, whisper, and say "come."
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">One night saw large people in room&nbsp;;
          large rats running&nbsp;; felt a delicate hand smoothing her head from

          a dream.</font></i>
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Wild and desperate feeling, as of

          <br>Tendency to suicide, gets up in night and takes his pistol, but

          <br><b><font color="#000080">Is in a great hurry&nbsp;; when doing
          anything is such a hurry that she gets fatigued.</font></b>
          <br>Strange exhilaration of spirits.
          <br>Alternation of happiness and gloominess.
          <br>Spirits in the depths, weighed down with heavy, solid gloom &gt;
          by torrents of tears.
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Is always anticipating&nbsp;; feels most
          matters sensitively before they occur and generally correctly.</font></i>
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Anticipates death.</font></i>
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Dread of saying the wrong thing when she
          has headache.</font></i>
          <br>Everything startles her, news coming to her seems to touch her
          heart before she hears it.
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Woke at an early hour with a frightened
          sensation, as if something dreadful had happened&nbsp;; heavy weight
          and great heat in head&nbsp;; could not rest in bed&nbsp;; felt as if
          she must do something to rid her mind of this torture.</font></i>
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Fear of the dark.</font></i>
          <br>Feeling as if he had committed the unpardonable sin and was going
          to hell.
          <br>A word or look of seeming harshness puts her in despondency for
          hours.
          <br>Indisposed to work or make mental effort&nbsp;; desire for rest
          and dread of change&nbsp;; noise, confusion, disorderliness of
          surroundings distressing&nbsp;; depression and much anxiety,
          especially after sleep&nbsp;; irritable if the room is not light
          enough to make everything distinct&nbsp;; craving for stimulants, but
          cannot endure the effects, for they cause a wild, crazy feeling in
          brain after the first sleep&nbsp;; same effect from using eyes.
          <br>Usually depressed&nbsp;; easily tired&nbsp;; disinclined to any
          exertion, and yet often unable to keep still&nbsp;; forgetful&nbsp;;
          unable to think connectedly&nbsp;; mind wanders from subject, even in
          reading&nbsp;; cannot think at all if hurried.
          <br>Always wakens tired in the morning&nbsp;; hates to do anything
          that must be done, even nice things&nbsp;; gets nervous and excited
          about ridding and driving as soon as the time is fixed.
          <br>Constant state of anguish.
          <br>Always a feeling of impending danger, but knows not what.
          <br>There is no cause for such feelings, as she is not obliged to do
          anything when disinclined&nbsp;; is so situated that nothing need
          cause her trouble.
          <br>Inability to think continuously, to talk or to listen to talking
          when weary&nbsp;; vacant feeling in head.
          <br>Forgetful, cannot remember the least thing any length of
          time&nbsp;; writes everything down of any importance&nbsp;; cannot
          trust herself to remember it&nbsp;; great irritability and disgust
          with life.
          <br>The impatience, excitement, wild feelings&nbsp;; the unreal, dazed
          conditions&nbsp;; the gloom and fear in the dark&nbsp;; the difficulty
          of speaking without tears, are marked evidence of functional
          derangement of the nervous system.
          <br>Medorrhinum is forgetful of names, words, etc., but instead of
          forgetting <i><font color="#0000ff">occurrences</font></i>, during
          certain periods of time, like Syphilinum, it forgets what it is
          reading, even to the last line read&nbsp;; it cannot concentrate its
          attention&nbsp;; thinks words spelled wrong and have no meaning, etc.
          <br>Medorrhinum develops a peculiar sensitivity especially in relation
          to occurrences affecting itself.
          <br>It feels the evil coming to it, and the bad news before it
          arrives, of course it is selfish, and it is easily hurt by a harsh
          word.
          <br>It is also introspective, self-accusative, remorseful.
          <br>Time moves slowly to it, therefore it is hurried.
          <br>We find a dazed condition from the loss of the thread of thought,
          which annoys and causes a dread of saying the wrong thing, and a
          difficulty in stating symptoms.
          <br>It is always anticipating, fearing evil will happen, loss of
          reason or suicide.
          <br>It fears it has committed the unpardonable sin, and cares little
          for the result, because of the seething, restless, uneasy, unbalanced
          nerves.
          <br>Feeling of desperation&nbsp;; did not care if he went to heaven or
          hell.
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Cross through day, exhilarated at night,
          wants to play.</font></i>
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Irritated at little things.</font></i>
          <br>Nerve trembling, with worry.
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Very impatient.</font></i>
          <br>Reading and writing make her nervous and enrage her.
          <br>Great selfishness.
          <br>Time moves so slowly that things done an hour ago appear to have
          occurred a year since&nbsp;; asked the time of day, and in five
          minutes insisted that half an hour had elapsed and could not believe
          it had not till she had seen the watch.</p>

          was found.
          <br>In 1901, after 16 years of coughing, he consulted Dr. Ide, one of
          our greatest homeopathic physicians.
          <br>He ordered the doctor to take Medorrhinum one dose, and await the
          result.
          <br>On reaching home he took the dose, and next morning had no cough,
          nor did he cough afterwards, even in the open air.
          <br>As an officer he had had a gonorrhea, of which he could not get
          rid.
          <br>From this he always had an unpleasant feeling and burning pain.

          of rheumatism to a sycotic origin.

          <br>Noeggerath says latent gonorrhea in husband may cause in wife
          acute and chronic perimetritis oophoritis&nbsp;; if impregnation
          results, abortion follows, or only one child is born&nbsp;;
          exceptionally two or three.
          <br>I have traced epithelioma, phthisis, cauliflower excrescences,
          sterility, and erosions to a sycotic origin&nbsp;; pernicious anemia
          often has gonorrhea as its base&nbsp;; suppressed gonorrhea may
          produce iritis, syphilis produces it without suppression.
          <br>The suppression of the external manifestations of gonorrhea seems,
          first to involve the central nervous system functionally, and is much
          later in attacking the organism destructively.</p>

          <br>At the seashore&nbsp;; lying on the face or stomach&nbsp;; damp
          weather (Caust., Nux)&nbsp;; by leaning far back (constipation, can
          only pass stool in this position).
          <br>In summer, 1875, I had an obstinate case of acute articular
          rheumatism in a man æt. 60, from June 11th to September 5th&nbsp;; he
          suffered excruciating agony from neuralgia.
          <br>After a desperate battle for life the first week of September, he
          was relieved, and arose from his bed a wreck.
          <br>It was expected that time and out-door life and the best hygienic
          measures would restore him.
          <br>But weeks and months passed without change, he walked the streets
          leaning on a cane, bent over, muffled in wraps to his ears, and
          looking like an old man about to fall into the grave.
          <br>Three months after my attendance I saw him pass my office, and
          considering his previous good health and robust frame the question
          arose&nbsp;: Why does he remain in this condition&nbsp;? Is there any
          miasm hereditary or acquired uncured to explain the obstinacy of the
          case&nbsp;? Could it be a gonorrhea taint&nbsp;? For reasons
          unnecessary to mention I could not ask him.
          <br>Dr. Swan's suggestion now occurred to me&nbsp;: An obstinate case
          of rheumatism might be due to latent gonorrhea, and Medorrhinum high
          will cure it&nbsp;; in many cases where improvement reaches a certain
          stage, and then stops, Medorrhinum has removed the obstruction and the
          case progressed to a cure&nbsp;; and this too in cases where gonorrhea
          appeared to be a most unlikely cause, teaching us, if anything, the
          universality of latent gonorrhea and the curative power of the dynamic
          virus.
          <br>His wife consulted me on other matters, and said "her husband
          was as well as could be expected considering his age&nbsp;; she
          believed he would not do anything more, as he regarded his feeble
          state due to his age."
          <br>However, he came next day, and I gave him three doses of
          Medorrhinum, to be taken every morning&nbsp;; within ten days he
          returned feeling well and looking well.
          <br>I then gave him one dose to be taken after some time&nbsp;; this
          was the prescription he has required.
          <br>Within the month, after the Medorrhinum, he dropped his cane and
          muffler, walked the street erect with a firm step a perfectly well
          man, having increased in weight from 140 to 212 pounds.</p>
