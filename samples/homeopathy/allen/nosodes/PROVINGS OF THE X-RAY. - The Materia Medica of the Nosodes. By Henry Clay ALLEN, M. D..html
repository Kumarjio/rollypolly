          <br>If Constantine Hering had never given the homeopathic profession
          anything but his admirable pathogenesis of Lachesis he would have been
          remembered in gratitude for all time by the homeopathic world.
          <br><img alt="Dr Bernhardt FINCKE (1821-1906)" src="./PROVINGS OF THE X-RAY. - The Materia Medica of the Nosodes. By Henry Clay ALLEN, M. D._files/fincke02.jpg" border="0" align="right" hspace="5" width="173" height="240">If Bernhardt Fincke had never given the
          homeopathic profession anything but his proving of the X-ray, his
          name, too, would be held in grateful remembrance by posterity, for its
          possibilities in the cure of many of the most obstinate of chronic
          diseases appear almost limitless.
          <br>We are indebted to Dr. John B. Campbell, one of the original
          provers, for the discovery of the great value of this dynamic agent in
          rousing the reactive vitality of the system, both mentally and
          physically, and thus bringing to the surface suppressed symptoms of
          persons laboring under a combination of dyscrasia, the miasms of
          Hahnemann. This is especially true of the deep-seated constitutional
          ailments, sycotic in character, which so often terminate in malignant
          disease, especially cancer.
          <br>When the sycotic or syphilitic virus is grafted on a psoric or
          tubercular diathesis&nbsp;; when from the paucity of presenting
          symptoms it is almost impossible to be certain of the predominant
          diathesis, in consequence of which the best selected antipsoric,
          Calcarea, Medorrhinum, Psorinum, Sepia, Sulphur, Syphilinum, or
          Tuberculinum, fails to relieve or to rouse the overpowered vitality to
          a sufficient degree to throw off or bring to the surface the
          predominant toxine, the X-ray bids fair to be our curative remedy.
          <br>Every physician who has had even a limited experience in the
          treatment of the toxic effect of the X-rays on either a bone or soft
          tissue will not need any proof of its deep-seated character and the
          extreme difficulty under any form of treatment of arousing the
          overpowered vitality and effecting a cure.
          <br>An X-ray burn, so-called, whether of the bone or skin, is almost
          impossible to heal, and despite the best efforts of the ablest
          practitioner, the best treatment known to medical science of the
          present day, is often fatal.
          <br>Here is a field of action in which the potentized dynamic remedy
          bids fair to be unrivaled, for there is no known homeopathic agent,
          either crude or potentized, that in its primary action is so
          deep-seated or long-acting in results.
          <br>Neither is there any known agent that will more surely suppress
          and render incurable many chronic diseases as this, or none which
          better illustrates what Shakespeare said so long ago, that "Fools
          rush in where angels fear to tread, or where</p>
          <font size="2">
          <p align="CENTER">"A little learning is a dangerous things,
          <br>Drink deep or touch not the Pyerion spring."</p>
          </font>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">There is no therapeutic agent that so often cures,
          and so often fails where we think it ought to cure, in its empirical
          use, as this. If when its empirical use has roused latent vitality and
          restored suppressed symptoms we could correctly observe and interpret
          them, and for them find the similimum, what possibilities lie in the
          future&nbsp;?
          <br>As maintained by Hahnemann, Hering and Fincke and demonstrated by
          the work of the Austrian Provers' Union, the dynamic potentized drug
          is the chief factor in both proving and healing. Like Magnetis Polus
          Australis and other imponderabilia, electricity and the X-ray are both
          capable of potentization, and the potentized dynamic remedy is just as
          superior to the crude drug as Aurum, Lycopodium, Silicea or Sulphur.
          <br>A very able description of the discovery of the X-ray by Professor
          Roentgen was given in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Homeopathic
          Physician</font></i> (March, 1896), by Dr. Walter M. James, and
          concluded with the words&nbsp;:
          <br>"Why should not the homeopathist seek to procure a proving of
          the effects of the X-ray upon the animal economy of the human
          being&nbsp;? An inviting field is there opened up to the experimenters
          of our school. May it soon be cultivated&nbsp;!"
          <br>March 27, 1897. A drachm vial filled with absolute alcohol was
          exposed to a Crook's tube in operation for half an hour, and then
          brought up to the sixth centesimal potency. With this smallest
          globules were moistened and the vials containing them presented to the
          members of the Brooklyn Hahnemannian Union, which met the same evening
          in regular session.
          <br>Of course everyone was curious of trying the new remedy and took a
          small number of globules on the tongue at once, and lo&nbsp;! it began
          to reveal its existence immediately, and during the two hours of our
          being together a number of symptoms were observed, which were at once
          announced and taken down by our diligent Secretary. Some of the
          members from that time have been seriously affected, that they would
          not for any consideration try any more of that mysterious power.
          <br>The following is a narrative of its action upon the several
          provers, being perfectly healthy up to that time, which lasted from
          the beginning to two months. The action reveals not only new symptoms,
          but also hunted up many old ones.
          <br>If it is assumed that glass is opaque to the X-ray, it was not so
          in our case, for the alcohol in the vial was certainly affected by it,
          as the result of the provings show.
          <br>If the X-ray penetrates certain tissues of the body in order to
          make the condition of the opaque organs, such as the bones and foreign
          bodies contained in the body, visible, it also shows its penetration
          into that invisible interior of the human being, which is under the
          dominion of the life-force.
          <br>Dr. Alice B. Campbell one of the provers, said&nbsp;:
          <br>"Dr. Fincke presented each of us with a bottle of the X-rays,
          and said&nbsp;: "It is a sample, you can take a dose." Each
          of us took a dose. I thought it was such a low potency that it would
          not have any effect, and that was the reason I took it. We did not
          know what it was going to do. I took just the one dose."
          <br>I was in the best of health and spirits when I began to use the
          X-ray&nbsp;; was a healthy girl, never had a doctor until pregnancy.
          <br>Now 24, 1906. A lady, aged 56, hereditary cancer in her
          family&nbsp;; mother died of it at 52. For an injury of right breast,
          which resulted in a tumor, which would probably develop into cancer,
          the X-ray was used for months, reduced its size and entirely relieved
          the pain. Some time after a stiffening of neck on left side appeared,
          to which little attention was paid. Suddenly one morning it went to
          right side, with intense pain, from which I have never been free for a
          moment since. Pain severe every night, and occurs in paroxysms during
          the day. Sudden "cricks" attack first one side, then the
          other &lt; on getting cold&nbsp;; and turning the head nearly produces
          convulsions. The pain is more severe behind the ears, the mastoid
          process. A sickening grating is heard between the bones of the
          cervical spine on turning the head. Skin behind the ears red and sore
          to touch.
          <br>The grating is heard and felt in nearly all the joints, especially
          the shoulders&nbsp;; toe pains are steady, but at times will appear in
          sharp "cricks", then in streaks down the course of the
          nerves &lt; by moving the head on pillow at night is agony. Sometimes
          the pain is relieved on keeping perfectly quiet, again gentle motion
          relieves.
          <br>Have read all the stiff neck symptoms in Lippe, Hering, Raue, T.
          F. Allen and other works&nbsp;; the indicated remedy has failed to
          give me slightest relief.
          <br>Dec. 1, 1906. Last three days left side of head and neck pain
          intensely and constantly, at times paroxysms of cramping pain in cord,
          from left shoulder to head, and sharp shooting pain in head, back and
          above left ear. Cords feel too short. Only relief I have is in walking
          the floor. Skin is so sore, cannot bear the slightest touch, though
          hard pressure relieves for an instant. I am nearly mad with pain. (Dr.
          G has said frequently in the last month that he was afraid that I was
          getting too much X-ray&nbsp;; I thought not, although I thought is
          very queer he could not relieve my pain).
          <br>Jan. 9, 1907. Have taken no X-ray treatment since Nov. 23rd. Have
          not been out of the house for six weeks. Suffered torture four weeks
          at every motion of head, neck or shoulders. The neuralgic pains were
          torturing, and the best selected remedies had little or no effect.
          Spigelia partially relieved severity of pains, but they appeared on
          the right side of head and neck, yet never left the left side for an
          instant. Atropin relieved the right sided pain for 24 hours, but neck
          and shoulder are still lame. I now have no severe pain, if I lie still
          on left side of face and body, but am unable to lift head from pillow
          without taking my hands, and then only by a slow circular motion.
          <br>I can sit up or stand for 15 or 30 minutes, and then clutching,
          shooting, aching pains begins behind left ear, and in muscles of left
          side of neck, and I must lie down on left side, and in a few minutes
          am free from pain. The stinging, contracting of the muscles relieved,
          but the pain in back of head is still persistent. Massage, at times,
          has given slight relief, at other times the slightest touch is so
          painful that if cannot be borne. Heat relieves the pains at times, but
          Arsenic does not.
          <br>Jan. 14. Improving some&nbsp;; yesterday could lie with a much
          higher pillow, first time in six weeks. Should be able to bear the
          pains, could the darting, aching, clutching pain in the bone behind
          the left ear, which makes its appearance every time I sit up over
          twenty minutes, be relieved. The stinging, contracting pain is better,
          and notwithstanding all the suffering from the last few weeks, I do
          not look as if I had been ill&nbsp;; color good and gaining weight.
          <br>The tumor is breast is softening some, and decreasing in size.
          <br>The X-ray treatment was always the very lightest possible, and
          never once colored the skin red, although tanning it very brown. Took
          it at first but once a week&nbsp;; the effect being so good, applied
          it every third or fourth day. The first pain I had was a slight
          stiffness of neck on left side. In March it was only felt on turning
          in bed at night&nbsp;; increased slightly and gradually until Nov.
          1st&nbsp;; though I had one severe paroxysm of pain in right side of
          neck in May, relieved by hot applications, which still give some
          relief at times. Sitting in the hot sun shining on my neck gives some
          relief. Have suffered intensely of late from flushes of heat, similar
          to those I had During climacteric&nbsp;; better afternoons and
          evenings. The back of head at times seems perfectly well next moment
          cannot bear slightest touch or lift my head from the pillow without
          great pain on both sides in muscles of neck.
          <br>1. <i><font color="#0000ff">Dr. B. L. B. B</font></i>., after one
          dose of X-ray 6 cent.
          <br>A magnetic thrill in right hand extending up forearm, immediately.
          <br>No particular symptoms the next day.
          <br>Next morning awaked earlier than usual by dull aching in the left
          side of occiput, and immediately in left sacro-iliac region, then on
          posterior aspect of left thigh and calf, a dull ache. These pains
          extend from above downward, not severe, lasting fifteen minutes.
          <br>In afternoon suddenly a sharp ache in left side of occiput on a
          small area. This occurred two or three times at intervals of some
          hours without regularity.
          <br>After that in the course of two or three days a trouble which he
          had once before, a catarrhal condition of inflammation of rectum with
          discharge of mucus, slightly bloody, after action of bowels.
          <br>Corns on soles of feet more sensitive that formerly, consisting of
          thickening of cuticle, and sometimes a little pin-head depression

          <br>Most distress after midday and evening meal.
          <br>Abdomen distended with full feeling.
          <br>(Pulsatilla, which a year ago helped for months a train of
          symptoms, had only very slight effect).
          <br>Drawing gnawing in the region of appendix as though inflammation
          were beginning.
          <br>Sensation in right lower abdomen as though bubbles were forming
          and wanting to burst (relieved by Taraxacum for twenty-four hours).
          <br>Flatulence with ineffectual desire for stool.
          <br>Seven days after taking the medicine was roused out of bed at 4 A.
          M. with desire for stool, and complete evacuation of immense quantity
          followed by nausea and vomiting, profuse sweat.
          <br>Colicky pain in right lower abdomen, sometimes extending behind
          hip, and retained urine.
          <br>Tenesmus vesicæ continuing for twelve hours to 4 P. M., when the
          urine came freer.
          <br>Vomiting ceased though colic-pains remained for twelve days.
          <br>Moving &lt; pains especially on right side of abdomen, which
          seemed to adhere to the walls, feeling as if being torn off.

          blue rings around sunken eyes, violent trembling, frightful
          restlessness, cold sweat, urine retained in ureter, giving a perfect
          picture of Tabacum which also relieved the symptoms.
          <br>As soon as the pains in the ureter relaxed, the urine seemed to
          fill up the bladder and then passed without pain.
          <br>Some spasm remained and was relieved by Cantharis in five minutes.

          medicine resurrects old troubles that have been long dormant, and
          remedies that formerly helped have little, if any, effect against the
          renewed difficulty. In five provers old symptoms were brought to
          light. In some cases the symptoms had been absent one year, some six,
          twelve or even thirty years.

          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Observation of the Prover</font></i>. It
          seems this medicine might be used in three ways&nbsp;:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="JUSTIFY">1. To develop old troubles or those which might
            become latent from any cause including suppression.
            <br>2. To develop acute symptoms already present as against its own

          as large as a silver dollar on the right buttock was red and tough as
          if the skin were abraded.
          <br>On going to bed a blister as large as a hickory nut, not unlike a
          fish bladder, was present, from which smaller blisters extended down
          in a curve.
          <br>The redness and roughness was enlarged to about three inches in
          diameter.
          <br>On being quiet there was no pain, but on the least motion or
          friction, the part burned like fire, or a severe burn.
          <br>In the night the blister opened, and another had come opposite to
          the first, as large as a chestnut.
          <br>The pains on motion, touch, or friction, continued like a real
          burn.
          <br>The skin was red, rough and inflamed, like raw meat, for four
          inches down, with small blisters of different size extending downward.
          <br>The large blister discharged gradually, and a scab formed, which,
          under cessation of pain, fell off, so that by the end of September the
          skin was as sound as before.
          <br>This reminds me of a similar experience observed from repeated
          action of the X-ray upon the skin, resulting in a denudation of the
          tibia for the space of about six inches, as far as the leg was exposed
          to the rays, because it would not heal from an ulcer consequent upon
          an injury.
          <br>"On the red erythematous surface elevations begin to appear,
          of different sizes and which may be acuminate or papular.
          <br>In the early stage they are barely visible, and resemble ordinary
          congestion papules.
          <br>If, however, their surface is scratched with a needle, a yellow
          serous slightly opaque fluid exudes and the papule disappears.
          <br>These elevations, though of small size, are in reality vesicles.
          <br>They occur in groups or disseminated over the surface, and
          ultimately develop into vesico-bulle, or vesico-pustules which have
          the appearance of an ordinary eruption."
          <br>"In a weeping eczema the exudation disappears after one to
          four exposures, and does not return."
          <br>"In pruriginous eczema the itching often ceases after a
          single application."
          <br>"On dry eczema the effect of the rays is most marked."
          <br>A single application is frequently sufficient.
          <br>"It is in the more obstinate, chronic, and recurring types
          that they are the most useful."
          <br>To quote now from Dr. Hall-Edwards&nbsp;: "The disease
          generally makes its first appearance in the form of a mild erythema
          around the roots of the nails.
          <br>The nails begin to thicken and their substance to degenerate,
          until they become shapeless masses.
          <br>The skin becomes uniformly red, and later small watery growths
          appear.
          <br>These gradually increase in size and number, whilst the skin
          generally becomes dry and wrinkled.
          <br>At this stage, apart from the disfigurement, the patient suffers
          no inconvenience.
          <br>The watery growths continue to increase in size, and the skin
          loses its elasticity to such an extent that it cracks with the
          slightest exertion.
          <br>These cracks are very painful and difficult to heal.
          <br>Pain of an almost indescribable character, which appears to come
          from the bones, and which is &lt; by holding the hands downwards, is
          felt.
          <br>Loss of power in the arm muscles is also experienced.
          <br>At this stage the skin between the warty growths exhibits marked
          telangiectasis, is considerably thickened, and is tied down to the
          subjacent tissues.
          <br>There is an ever-present sensation of burning and extreme itching,
          so that it requires no small amount of self-control to keep from
          scratching.
          <br>The bases of some of the larger warts become inflamed, and the
          thickened mass may come away, leaving an ulcer which takes months to
          heal.
          <br>These ulcers are so tender and painful that words fail to convey
          any idea of the suffering of the patient.
          <br>They occasionally refuse to heal, become gradually larger, and may
          assume malignant characteristics, which demand operative
          interference."
          <br>Dr. J. T. Pitkin, in a paper read before the "American
          Roentgen Ray Society", in 1903, thus graphically describes the
          sufferings of this terrible disease&nbsp;: "For a description of
          the pain and suffering, hyperæsthesia and paresthesia, no language,
          sacred or profane, is adequate.
          <br>The sting of the honey bee or the passage of a renal calculus is
          painful enough, but they are comparative pleasure&nbsp;; being
          paroxysmal, they have a time limitation.
          <br>Extreme tenderness to the slight touch, hot and cold waves and
          flashes, warmth, tingling, pricking, throbbing, stinging, crawling,
          boring, and horning sensations, as if the parts were on fire and
          contained bugs and other living things, feelings as if the anatomical
          structures were being removed from one position to another&nbsp;; all
          of these sensations are proportionate to the depth of the inflammatory
          process."</p>

          <br>"Six years ago I received a severe X-ray burn on my left hand
          and finger.
          <br>Eighteen months afterwards warts appeared one seedy old chap, near
          knuckle of left index finger, second joint, gave me much concern.
          <br>Various remedies were tried.
          <br>Five months ago it became exceedingly annoying to me, and then I
          looked up the Materia Medical carefully, and three, sure enough, was
          the remedy.
          <br>I took Causticum 200, and one dose, after a while, of the cm.
          <br>I am usually a high potency man.
          <br>The result was a cure.
          <br>Then I recalled the article of Dr. W. P. Wesselhoeft, in October
          issue, 1906, <i><font color="#0000ff">Medical Advance</font></i>,
          under "Reminiscences", and had I remembered it I could have
          been cured of the unsightly warts long before.
          <br>Some day I may write up the case for the <i><font color="#0000ff">Medical
          Advance</font></i>.
          <br>It may help out some one suffering from these X-ray warts, so
          common from X-rays." Sgd. <i><font color="#0000ff">J. W. King, M.
          D</font></i>.
          <br>Kienböck lays down this axiom&nbsp;: "The stronger the dose
          given at a séance, the shorter the period of latency, the sharper the
          reaction, and the longer its duration."
          <br>"The first degree of intensity is characterized by hyperemia
          and infiltration of the skin, accompanied by exfoliation of minute
          scales and a considerable amount of itching.
          <br>Atrophy of the appendages of the skin glands, hair and nails may
          follow.
          <br>"The second degree of dermatitis is characterized by the
          occurrence of vesiculation and phlyctenule.
          <br>Inflammatory signs are severe, the tension considerable and the
          pain intense.
          <br>Under the phlyctenule the bares chorion appears red and
          discharging.
          <br>"The third degree is characterized by total destruction and
          sloughing of the irradiated tissues.
          <br>These show the usual signs of dry gangrene&nbsp;; the sloughs
          separate slowly, leaving behind an ulcer of a very torpid nature,
          which sometimes remains unhealed for years.
          <br>"In radiotherapy one should endeavour to irradiate the tissue
          with the exact quantity necessary to produce a definite result.
          <br>In the use of other therapeutic agents we are often obliged to
          vary the dose.
          <br>A given dry may have tonic-action in a small dose, an emetic
          action in a moderate dose, and a poisonous action in a large dose.
          <br>The same may be said of X-ray.
          <br>Take, for example, their action on the scalp.
          <br>In small fractional doses they have a stimulating effect on the
          hair, whereas in large doses they cause epilation, and in still larger
          doses vesiculation, and sloughing."</p>

          <br>"At first sight it may seem contradictory that the same agent
          will, in one case, cause the hair to fall out, and in another case
          favour its growth.
          <br>The contradiction, however, is only apparent, as the results
          depend on the amount of rays absorbed by the hair papilla and the
          consequent inflammatory reaction.
          <br>It is evident that if this factor is varied the results will be
          altered."</p>
