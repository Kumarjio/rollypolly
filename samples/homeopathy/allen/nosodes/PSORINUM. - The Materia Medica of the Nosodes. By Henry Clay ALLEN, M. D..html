          <br>In the subsequent list of antisoric remedies no isopathic remedies
          are mentioned, for the reason that their effects upon the healthy
          organism have not been sufficiently ascertained. Even the itch miasm
          (psorinum), in its various degrees of potency, comes under this
          objection. I call psorin a homeopathic anti-psoric, because if the
          preparations of psorin did not alter its nature to that of a
          homeopathic remedy it never could have any effect upon an organism
          tainted with that same identical virus. The psoric virus, by
          undergoing the processes of trituration and shaking, becomes just as
          much altered in its nature as gold does, the homeopathic preparations
          of which are not inert substances in the animal economy, but
          powerfully acting agents.
          <br>Psorinum is a similimum of the itch virus. There is no
          intermediate degree between idem and similimum&nbsp;; in other words,
          the thinking man sees that similimum is the medium between simile and
          idem. The only definite meaning which the terms "isopathic and
          菉uale" can convey is that of similimum&nbsp;; they are not
          idem.
          <br>Hitherto syphilis alone has been to some extent known as such a
          chronic miasmatic disease, which when uncured ceases only with the
          termination of life. Sycosis (the condylomatatous disease), equally
          ineradicable by the vital force without proper medicinal treatment,
          was not recognized as a chronic miasmatic disease of a peculiar
          character, which it nevertheless undoubtedly is, and physicians
          imagined they had cured it when they had destroyed the growth upon the
          skin, but the persisting dyscrasia occasioned by it escaped their
          observation.
          <br>Incalculably greater and more important than the two chronic miasm
          just named, however, is the chronic miasm of psora, which, whilst
          those two reveal their specific internal dyscrasia, the one by the
          venereal chancre, the other by the cauliflower-growths, does also,
          after the completion of the internal infection of the whole organism,
          announce by a peculiar cutaneous eruption, sometimes consisting of
          only a few vesicles accompanied by intolerable voluptuous tickling
          itching (and a peculiar odor), the monstrous internal chronic miasm
          the psora, the only real fundamental cause and producer of all the
          other numerous, I may say innumerable, forms of disease, which under
          the names of nervous debility, hysteria, hypochondriasis, mania,
          melancholia, imbecility, madness, epilepsy and convulsions of all
          sorts, softening of the bones (rachitis), scoliosis and cyphosis,
          caries, cancer, fungus hematodes, neoplasms, gout, hemorrhoids,
          jaundice, cyanosis, dropsy, amenorrh라, hemorrhage from the stomach,
          nose, lungs, bladder and womb, of asthma and ulceration of the lungs,
          of impotence and barrenness, of megrim, deafness, cataract, amaurosis,
          urinary calculus, paralysis, defects of the senses and pains of
          thousands of kinds, etc., figure in systematic works on pathology as

          the hands, the arms, the legs.
          <br>Attacks of loss of consciousness, lasting a moment or a minute,

          induces the most violent diseases, swoons, hysterics, complaints of
          all degrees, fevers, hemoptysis, etc., whereas a person that is not
          affected with psora is able to lift any burdens he pleases, without

          arms and legs, and even in the face&nbsp;; the skin is dry, rough,
          parching, feels chapped, often scaly like bran).
          <br>Eczema&nbsp;: something more than a year since a young lady came
          under my observation who had one of the worst cases I ever saw. At 15
          years I remember her as attractive and brilliant, with a fine head of
          hair and one of the most perfect complexions, or skins, I ever saw.
          Upon questioning her I learned&nbsp;: Family history negative. Had
          been in every way in perfect health. At 14 years was vaccinated,
          "worked" well, six months later attended a school exhibition
          one very cold night in winter and face was considerably exposed. Next
          morning awakened, face grealty swollen, intensely red, almost
          unbearable itching. Eyes suffused and injected, ears double their
          normal size. Very little constitutional disturbance. Called an
          allopathic physician who employed local and internal measures with
          little immediate result. Soon papules were formed, many of which
          became vesicular and not a few pustular&nbsp;; discharge of thick,
          dirty fluid which stained and stiffened linen. Hair was cut close and
          "locals" applied here also. Week after week she had slight
          improvements and aggravations. She was of strong allopathic faith, yet
          after three years of arsenic, potash, cathartics, zinc and a dozen
          other local applications she sought homeopathic treatment. Appeared to
          improve for a time, then as bad as ever, and finally returned to
          allopathy&nbsp;; finding no relief, employed some patent remedies with
          apparent transitory improvement. She was now, at the time I saw her,
          taking nothing at all, had suffered for six years, and was still as
          bad as ever, or even slightly worse. I found her in mind, though
          naturally bright and cheerful, very despondent, with even suicidal
          thoughts, complete despair of recovery. Hair dry and without lustre,
          eyes somewhat suffused and injected, which condition attends a sort of
          incipient asthmatic affection, making its appearance each fall&nbsp;;
          some hoarseness. Face, neck and much of body was coarse, rough and of
          a dirty brown color. Does not perspire at all. Eruption behaves much
          the same as at first and above described, itching intolerably, better
          by gentle scratching which is continued until it bleeds. Between
          points of eruption skin is much indurated. Eruption surrounded by
          bluish circle&nbsp;; pruritus worse at night, when undressing, and by
          warmth of bed. Desquamation is so great that the sheet was each
          morning shaken and scales swept away. I went to work with a faint
          heart, feeling that I was somewhat lacking in uncommon and peculiar
          symptoms. I prescribed Psorinum 200 (<i><font color="#0000ff">B. &amp;
          T.</font></i>), a powder each night dry on tongue, for a week.
          <br>Eruption in bends of elbows and knees&nbsp;; dry, scaly and small
          pointed vesicles around the reddened joints&nbsp;; disappeared
          entirely in summer and reappeared when cold weather set in&nbsp;;
          violent itching &lt; by warmth of bed or by scratching. Psorinum 42
          m., two doses, at six weeks intervals, cured. No return the following
          winter.
          <br>A teething baby, nine months old, had eczema, beginning at outer
          angle of right eye and spreading over entire face. First a raised
          inflamed base of a tawny red, then scattered pustules which coalesced
          to form large crusts, from which oozed an oily, yellow, viscid
          discharge, cracks upon ears with a similar discharge. Graphites cm.
          was given without result&nbsp;; then Sulphur, but the eruption spread
          until the cheeks were a mass of crusts. It then appeared on back and
          arm and one leg, and here gave off fine bran-like scales. The scalp
          soon became involved and covered with crusts a quarter of an inch
          thick. Psorinum cm., one dose, which &lt; for a week, then improvement
          began and went on to a perfect cure&nbsp;; notwithstanding the
          eruption of three teeth.
          <br>A man, aged 80, suffered with eczema since 18 years old, which
          appeared soon after vaccination. A very troublesome cough had annoyed
          him for months, for which I was called to attend him.
          <br>Cough &lt; at night, on lying down and on rising in the morning.
          Coughs long before expectorating. Sputa yellowish, salty, puriform.
          Sensation of pressure on chest&nbsp;; requires great effort to expand
          lungs. Chest painful, &lt; after coughing&nbsp;; mucous rales over
          both lungs. Loss of appetite. Eczema always &lt; in winter&nbsp;;
          intense itching &lt; nights. The eczema had been suppressed by local
          treatment, and cough developed. Psorinum cm. Within 48 hours cough and
          chest symptoms improved, but the eczema reappeared over the body, with
          intense itching. Improving in health, but still has some eczema which
          gives him little trouble. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Chapman</font></i>.
          <br>Mrs. M., aged 72, tissues enormously distended with dropsy, unable
          to lie down for nine weeks from dyspn라. Legs from ankles to crest of
          ilium and arms from wrist to elbows covered with a dirty, scaly
          eruption, itching violently &lt; at night, could not avoid scratching,
          which gave no relief until it caused bleeding. All forms of external
          applications had been used in a vain effort to suppress the eruption.
          Psorinum 52m. one powder in four teaspoonfuls of water, given in four
          doses, half hour intervals, and six powders of placebo, one each
          night, gave prompt relief, and the patient was able to walk in two
          weeks. One week later another dose was required, as there was a slight
          return of the eruption on the ankles&nbsp;; this completed the cure. -
          <i><font color="#0000ff">Hawley</font></i>.
          <br>Eczema Rubrum&nbsp;: Mrs. G., aged 71, face red and swollen,
          almost erysipelatous in appearance. Heat of fire caused torture when
          it touched her face&nbsp;; always sits with her back to the fire. Cold
          air &gt; bathing &lt;, must dry face with great care. Burning and
          itching intolerable&nbsp;; cannot sleep&nbsp;; sits all night by an
          open window gently rubbing face with a handkerchief. Scratching
          increases burning and itching&nbsp;; mental excitement, of which she
          has much, greatly &lt;. Psorinum 500 cured in one month.
          <br>A woman had attacks of terrible itching of skin without eruption
          through three periods of gestation. In the last she complained of the
          same itching, when Dr. Lippe advised Psorinum. In two days erysipelas
          appeared. Her face was very much swollen.</p>
