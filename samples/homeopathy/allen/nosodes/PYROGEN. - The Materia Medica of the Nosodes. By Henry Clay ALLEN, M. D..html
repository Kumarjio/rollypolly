          Vomiting and purging&nbsp;; stools profuse and watery. Cold
          extremities, ears and nose&nbsp;; forehead bathed in cold
          perspiration. Tongue heavily coated, yellowish-gray&nbsp;; edges of
          tip very red. Great prostration. Great restlessness mental and
          physical&nbsp;; pulse 140, small and wiry&nbsp;; temperature 99. Great
          thirst for small quantities, but the smallest quantity was instantly
          rejected. Later in day stool was horribly offensive, of a carrion-like
          odor&nbsp;; face pale, sunken, bathed in cold perspiration. Tongue
          dark red and free from the heavy coating of early morning, intense
          thirst, but water &lt; both vomiting and purging. After Ver., Ars.,
          Carbo v. and Bap. had been given, with no improvement, the patient
          evidently sinking, impossible to count the pulse, thinking perhaps
          sewer-gas poison may have been the factor, and the clean, fiery red
          tongue called my attention to Dr. Burnett's cures in the Homœopathic
          World with Pyrogen. I gave two doses on the tongue with prompt and
          permanent relief.
          <br>Miss E. B., aged 14, complained of feeling weary, unable to go to
          school. Applying thermometer, found temperature 102, pulse 108, and
          her father sent for me. I found tongue abnormally red, thin, white fur
          at base. Has a slight epistaxis in the morning which Bryonia &gt;, but
          failed to affect the fever. As there was absolutely no pain and very
          few symptoms, she was allowed to wait a few days on placebo. Sewer-gas
          was now discovered as the cause&nbsp;; Pyrogen, one dose, was given
          with rapid recovery.
          <br>Inclined to talk all the time at night during the fever&nbsp;;
          cold sweat over the body&nbsp;; pain in the small of the back&nbsp;;
          desires to urinate&nbsp;; it is scant&nbsp;; talks to herself&nbsp;;
          urging to vomit, with cold feet&nbsp;; restlessness &gt; after
          sleeping&nbsp;; purple spots on the chest&nbsp;; cries out in her
          sleep that some one or a weight is lying on her&nbsp;; heart beats
          hard, has a laborious action&nbsp;; sensation as if the heart was too
          full of blood&nbsp;; it beats very loud, heart sounds can be heard
          some distance from the thorax, always can hear her heart beat&nbsp;;
          could not sleep last night for whizzing and purring of heart, when she
          did fall asleep was delirious. Sensation as if a cap were on her head.
          When she awakens and finds it there she knows that she is all right,
          that she is not delirious&nbsp;; &gt; after vomiting&nbsp;; whispers
          in her sleep&nbsp;; whispers to herself, if you ask her what she said
          does not answer&nbsp;; sensation as if she covered the whole
          bed&nbsp;; she knew that her head was on the pillow, but she could not
          tell where the rest of her body was.
          <br>She feels when lying on one side that she is one person and that
          when she turns to the other side she is another person&nbsp;;
          sensation as though the fever would not run in each alike, that is to
          say, she felt as though she was existing in a second person, or that
          there were two of her.
          <br>Coldness and chilliness all day that no fire would warm&nbsp;;
          sits by the fire and breathes the heat from the stove&nbsp;; chilly
          whenever leaving the fire&nbsp;; at night when the fever came on he
          had a sensation as if his lungs were on fire and that he must have
          fresh air, which soon brought relief.
          <br>Sensation as though he was crowded by his arms and legs&nbsp;;
          when turning over in bed they were still crowding him&nbsp;; as soon
          as the fever came on he commenced to urinate&nbsp;; he can tell every
          time when the fever is coming on because of this urgency to urinate.
          The urine is clear as spring-water. Very severe pain in the right
          side&nbsp;; knife-like pains going through to the back&nbsp;; &lt;
          from every motion, from coughing or talking or taking a long
          breath&nbsp;; &gt; from lying on the affected side&nbsp;; groaning
          with every breath&nbsp;; redness of the face and also of the ears, it
          looked as if the blood would burst out of them. After the fever leaves
          he still has the hallucination that he is very wealthy and he has a
          very large sum of money in the bank, and this was the last to leave
          him this idea that he had the money.
          <br>I can hardly mention Pyrogen without becoming enthusiastic, on
          account of the wonderful results that I have had from it in blood
          poisoning. In any kind of septic infection, either puerperal or
          traumatic, Pyrogen will do wonders, when the symptoms correspond. It
          is similar to Anthracinum in some respects.
          <br>An old woman dying with gangrene inoculated one of her
          nurses&nbsp;; the nurse had chills, high fever and red streaks running
          up the arm following the course of the lymphatics. Pyrogen rapidly
          removed the whole process. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Boger</font></i>.
          <br>The palmar surface of the left forearm was torn to the bone by a
          buzz-saw.
          <br>It was dressed by adhesive plaster, which was put on so tightly
          that it had to be removed in 24 hours, replaced by another and a few
          stitches taken&nbsp;; but the whole hand began to swell, became very
          painful, gradually grew worse for eighteen days, during which patient
          had few hours sleep. Whole hand and forearm were enormously swollen,
          almost black in color and mortification threatened. Amputation was now
          decided.
          <br>At this stage a homeopathic physician found in addition to the
          symptoms above the patient delirious and excited&nbsp;; he could not
          lie down, for the bed was too hard, nor could he rest the arm on
          anything, for everything on which it lay also seemed too hard. Pyrogen
          50m. In a few hours he was sleeping quietly, temperature reduced and
          pain lessened. Improvement was rapid and steady to complete recovery.
          <br>Slight elevation of temperature, severe rigor, followed by
          sweating. The rigors are usually severe, and they occasionally occur
          with the regularity of ague.
          <br>Pulse becomes weak and rapid.
          <br>Pulse felt in head and ears, painless throbbing.
          <br>Fever of the intermittent type, with the usual accompaniments of
          loss of appetite, restlessness, thirst.
          <br>Rigors cease after the first few days, but the temperature usually
          maintains a remittent character.
          <br>Puerperal fevers.
          <br>Typhoid fever.
          <br>Feverishness.
          <br>Pyæmia.
          <br>Septicemia.
          <br>Burning in the face.
          <br>Blood was throbbing all through every part of head and body could
          feel it even in my fingers.
          <br>Chilly all night.</p>
