          </font></b>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">Adam Lonicer, of Frankfort, about the middle of the
          16th century, is the first botanical writer to notice Ergot, and soon
          after Thalius speaks of it as used "<i><font color="#0000ff">ad
          sistendum sanguinem.</font></i>"
          <br>In 1623, Caspar Bauhin mentions it under the name of <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale luxurians</font></i>, and in 1639 the English
          botanist Ray alludes to its medicinal properties.
          <br>The true nature of Ergot, whether a product of diseased vegetable
          life or a true vegetable itself, has long been a source of a great
          diversity of opinion. But according to the latest authorities, Secale
          cornutum belongs to the order Thallophyta cellular or non-vascular
          plants. This is the lowest order of the vegetable kingdom and is
          divided into two classes. Algæ and Fungi, which is based upon the
          presence in the former of Chlorophyll, and its absence in the latter.
          They produce no differentiation of root, stem or leaf. In the lowest
          members of the group there is no sexual reproduction&nbsp;; in the
          higher the sexual union may be a single spore, or a mass of spores, or
          a fructification within which spores are found. De Candolle and Fries
          in 1816, and Léveille, in 1827, added by their researches, much to
          our knowledge of the intimate structure of Secale, but it remained to
          L. R. Tulsane, in 1853, by his admirable monograph "Mémoire sur
          l'Ergot des Glumacées", to clear up many disputed points in the
          formation, growth and development of this fungus, and this monograph
          is still referred to by nearly every author as the best work on the
          subject. Yet Fluckiger and Hanbury maintain that the true nature of
          Ergot has not been settled even by Tulsane's long continued and
          admirable researches.</p>

          <p align="JUSTIFY">Hamilton sums up the conflicting views entertained
          by various writers as follows&nbsp;:</p>
          <blockquote>
            <b><font color="#000080">
            </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#000080">a.</font></b> "Some regard Ergot as a fungus
            growing between the glumes of grasses, in the place of the ovary
            (hence Léveille calls it <i><font color="#0000ff">Spacelia segetum</font></i>).
            <br><b><font color="#000080">b.</font></b> "Some regard Ergot
            as a diseased condition of the ovary or seed.
            <br><b><font color="#000080">c.</font></b> "Some have supposed
            that ordinary morbific causes (such as moisture combined with
            warmth) were sufficient to give rise to this diseased condition of
            the grain.
            <br><b><font color="#000080">d.</font></b> "Some have ascribed
            the disease to the attack of insects or other animals.
            <br><b><font color="#000080">e.</font></b> "Come, dissatisfied
            with the previously assigned causes of the disease, have been
            content with declaring Ergot to be a disease, but without specifying
            the circumstances which induce it."</p>
          </blockquote>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">Fluckiger and Hanbury state, "That the tissue
          of the seed of the rye, in the process of development, does not
          undergo a <i><font color="#0000ff">transformation</font></i>, but is
          simply <i><font color="#0000ff">destroyed.</font></i>"
          <br>Neither in external form, nor in anatomical structure, does Ergot
          exhibit any resemblance to a seed, although its development takes
          place between the flowering time and that at which the rye begins to
          ripen. It has been regarded as a complete fungus, and as such was
          named by De Candolle <i><font color="#0000ff">Sclerotium Claves</font></i>,
          and by Fries <i><font color="#0000ff">Spermoëdia Clavius</font></i>.
          Not further change occurs in the Ergot while it remains in the
          ear&nbsp;; but laid on damp earth, interesting phenomena take place.
          <br>At certain points small, orbicular patches of the rind fold
          themselves back, and gradually throw out little white heads. These
          increase in size whilst the outer layers of the neighbouring tissue
          gradually lose their firmness and become soft and rather granular, at
          the same time that the cells, of which they are made up, become empty
          and extended. In the interior of Ergot, the cells retain their oil
          drops unaltered. The heads assume a grayish-yellow color, changing to
          purple, and finally after some weeks stretch themselves towards the
          light on slender, shining stalks, of a pale, violet color. The stalks
          often attain an inch in length with a thickness of about half a line.
          Fluckiger further says&nbsp;: "Ergot of rye collected by myself
          in August, placed upon earth in a garden-pot and left in the open air
          unprotected through the winter, began to develop the <i><font color="#0000ff">Claviceps</font></i> on the 20th of March."
          <br>Hering calls it an undetermined fungus, and from the doubtful
          position it has so long held in the world of science classes it, not
          without some reason, as a "Nosode"&nbsp;; and when a
          doubtful point in Materia Medica is to be solved, the opinion of the
          venerated and scientific Hering is deserving of some consideration.
          <br><i><font color="#0000ff">Nosode</font></i>, he says&nbsp;:
          "Is the general term given to the alcoholic extracts of morbid
          productions, foolishly called isopathic remedies. The most useful and
          fully proved are Hydrophobinum and Psorinum. To these
          "Nosodes" belong the Ustilago maidis, the Secale cornutum,
          the fungus of the potato, the ambra of the potfish, anthracin,
          vaccinin, variolin, etc., etc. The sneering remarks of Trinks and
          others in 1826 against Sepia and the ignorant opposition to Lachesis
          have sunken into oblivion during the succeeding score of years. All
          the condemming remarks against the Hydrophobinum, Psorinum and other
          "Nosodes" will meet the same fate. We can afford to
          wait."</p>

          </font></b>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">For homeopathic use the Ergot of rye should always
          be prepared fresh, as it is fed on by a small acarus which destroys
          the interior of the grain, leaving it a mere shell.

          on this account.</p>
          <b><font color="#000080">
          <p align="CENTER">MEDICAL HISTORY.</p>
          </font></b>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the writings of the ancients there is no
          distinct notice to be found of Ergot.
          <br>In 1089 the French historian, Sigebert, refers to an epidemic in
          the following passage&nbsp;:
          <br>"A pestilent year, especially in the western parts of
          Lorraine, where many persons became putrid, in consequence of their
          inward parts being consumed by St. Anthony's fire. Their limbs were
          rotten and became black like coal. They either perished miserably or,
          deprived of their putrid hands and feet, were reserved for a more
          miserable life. Moreover, many cripples were afflicted with
          contraction of the sinews." An epidemic disease in Hessia in 1596
          first attracted the attention of the medical profession to Ergot as a
          cause. Rathlaw, a Dutch accoucheur, employed it m 1747, but it was not
          until thirty years later, 1777, that the essays of Desgranges, and
          especially those of Stearns and Prescott in the United States, that
          its medicinal properties became known.
          <br>To the use of rye flour, more or less adulterated with Ergot, is
          attributed the formidable disease known in modern medicine as <i><font color="#0000ff">Ergotism</font></i>, but in early times by a number of
          names&nbsp;: <i><font color="#0000ff">Morbus spasmodicus, Convulsivus
          Malignus, Epidemicus vel Cerealis, Convulsion Raphania, Ignus Sancti
          Antonia</font></i>. There is now little doubt that the terrible
          epidemics which occurred in France in the tenth century and in Spain
          in the twelfth century were due to Ergot. Fluckiger and Hanbury
          says&nbsp;: "In the year 1596 Hessia and the adjoining regions
          were ravaged by a frightful pestilence, which the medical faculty of
          Marburg attributed to the presence of Ergot in the cereals consumed by
          the population. The same disease appeared in France in 1630&nbsp;; in
          Voightland, Saxony, in the years 1648, 1649 and 1675&nbsp;; again in
          various parts of France in 1650, 1670 and 1674. Freiburg and vicinity
          were visited by the same malady in 1702&nbsp;; other parts of
          Switzerland in 1715-16&nbsp;; Saxony and Lusatia in 1716&nbsp;; many
          other districts of Germany in 1717, 1722, 1736 and 1741-42. The last
          European epidemic occurred after the rainy season of 1816 in Lorraine
          and Burgundy, and proved very fatal among the poorer classes."
          <br>From time to time a number of monographs giving a more or less
          accurate description of the various epidemics supposed to have been
          caused chiefly by Ergot and other adulterations in France, Germany and
          Switzerland have appeared. In 1825, the year previous to his departure
          for South America, Hering made a collection of these monographs which
          he left with Trinks, who had it completed by one of his assistant and
          published. These comprise the first 80 of the 170 authorities of the <i><font color="#0000ff">encyclopædia</font></i>, taken from Hartlaub and
          Trinks. The later additions are chiefly toxicological and clinical.
          <br>Dr. R. B. Johnstone, of Pittsford, N. Y., writes&nbsp;:
          <br>"In 1883-84, during the building of the West Shore Railroad,
          I was called upon to treat many of the Italian employés for an
          eruption which appeared upon the body in many places, but usually on
          the shoulders, neck and inner surface of the upper arms. In the
          majority of cases it was on the right side alone, but if on both sides
          was always worse on the right. The eruption would begin in a small
          point, life the prick of a pin, which would soon assume a pimple-like
          form and finally become pustular and as large as a small pea. At other
          times they would appear as large as a small boil (half an inch across
          the base), of a dark bluish hue, shading off to the healthy color of
          the skin an inch or more from centre of boil. They were <i><font color="#0000ff">intensely painful to touch, aching, burning and
          itching, better from light rubbing, worse from scratching, worse from
          heat</font></i>. The small one would dry up leaving no cicatrix, but
          the large ones would fill slowly with a bright yellow pus-like
          material, or at times a bloody, watery serum, remaining open for days,
          having extremely painful edges and base, and discharging towards its
          close a thick, dirty, offensive serum. They were decidedly indolent in
          character, and left a prominent cicatrix. Cool air blowing over the
          eruption would relieve the itching and burning, but not the pain.
          Secale, Lachesis, Causticum were the remedies chiefly indicated.
          Having learned that the Italians are largely of rye bread made of a
          very poor and cheap quality of flour, while other nationalities (not
          eating the rye bread) did not suffer from it at all, I attributed the
          eruption to poisoning by <i><font color="#0000ff">Ergot</font></i> in
          the bread&nbsp;; and if a patient presented without an interpreter I
          usually gave Secale, which would cure about seven cases in ten."
          <br>"H. G. K. A miller of Pittsford, N. Y., informs me that he is
          unable to grind rye even for a short time. Upon entering a rye mill,
          had a sensation of constriction in the throat, great difficulty in
          breathing&nbsp;; difficult inspiration&nbsp;; expiration accompanied
          by soreness all over the chest&nbsp;; oppression of the chest&nbsp;;
          soreness of the chest&nbsp;; intercostal pains&nbsp;; pricking of the
          tongue.
          <br>"The foregoing symptoms are distinctively of rye
          grinding&nbsp;; when grinding wheat no symptoms follow. He also
          informs me that in two rye mills in Rochester he knows a number of
          individuals engaged therein who suffer as above with the addition of
          an eruption particularly on the neck, chest, behind the ears and
          around the waist. The eruption is pustular, itching violently, and
          discharges a yellow matter. One man he knew who was compelled to give
          up rye grinding because of the many boils and carbuncles. He recovered
          entirely after changing his occupation. Nearly all rye grinders have
          enlarged finger joints and poor teeth."</p>

          morning and at night on retiring, for three days, then at night only,
          for a week.
          <br>March 9th. - A sore spot felt on back part of base of tongue, left
          side, as though a "canker sore" were making its
          appearance&nbsp;; it was not felt in day time and passed away after a
          few days.
          <br>March 10th and 11th. - A slight frontal headache and some mental
          confusion, but not very troublesome. Sore spot on base of tongue,
          right side.
          <br>March 13th. - Spots with a sore bruised feeling appeared about and
          below the left knee. On looking found a swollen patch about the size
          of a silver half dollar, of a purple red color. Towards evening three
          or four similar spots appeared further down the leg, about the top of
          the shoe, so sore could scarcely bear the touch of the shoe, and
          attended with violent itching, but were so extremely sore could not
          scratch them, and when touched gave me a faint, sick feeling.
          <br>March 14th. - Headache and confusion more pronounced, and chiefly
          in frontal region. Three or four spots appeared on right leg below the
          knee, with violent itching and the same sore bruised feeling.
          <br>March 15th. - An eruption in the form of a rash or small pustules
          appeared on the face, left side chiefly, very sore and sensitive to
          touch. It would begin in fine points like the prick of a pin or the
          sting of an insect and gradually increasing in size to small pustule
          as large as a pea. Felt like the spots on the legs, with the same
          sore, bruised feeling in the skin of face and neck. There were
          twenty-eight small pustules on left side of face and neck.
          <br>March 18th. - The eruption appeared on the left shoulder, several
          small pustules in a cluster, with the same characteristic soreness.
          Ceased taking drug. Dull, heavy headache in forehead and eyes&nbsp;;
          much throbbing. Before the menses (four or five days) a dark colored
          leucorrhea was observed, not very profuse, but attended with a tired
          and uneasy feeling in the pelvis.
          <br>April 5th. - The eruption on face, neck and shoulders gradually
          disappeared, but left discolored, ecchymosed spots and patches like
          the remains of an old bruise for several weeks, especially on lower
          leg.
          <br>April 18th. - Menses appeared on time, <i><font color="#0000ff">very
          profuse</font></i> for the first three or four days, accompanied by a
          good deal of pain and an uneasy sore feeling through the pelvis (much

          menses. Flow darker much more profuse (formerly profuse for one day)
          for four days. Considerable clotting. The flow continued for ten days,
