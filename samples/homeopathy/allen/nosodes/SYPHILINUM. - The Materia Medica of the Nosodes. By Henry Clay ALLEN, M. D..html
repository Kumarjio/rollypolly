          <br>Dr. Fellger said it was absurd to claim that any disease could be
          cured by its nosode, for after potentizing the nosode, we cannot be
          satisfied that it is in the same condition as when first taken from
          the diseased individual. Thus the syphilitic poison is composed of
          molecules of atoms. When the poison is potentized the essential
          character of the molecules is undoubtedly lost, and hence it is not
          the same substance any longer. Therefore, there can be no certainty
          that the potentized preparation is the same poison. But it, for
          argument, we allow that the molecules of the poison can be potentized
          without change of character, we still are not relieved of the dilemma,
          for primary syphilis in any one person will make a different set of
          symptoms from syphilis in another person. The variations are endless.
          Hence, we must then have a potentization of each one of these
          different kinds of syphilis, which would be impossible. Mercury is a
          staple substance, always unchanged&nbsp;; it might then be expected to
          produce identical sets of symptoms on any number of the most different
          people. Yet its action is different upon every person to whom it is
          given. How much more, then, must be the individual variations in the
          case of the poison of syphilis, and if mercury requires so many
          different remedies to antidote it, how much more, then, must syphilis
          need a variety of remedies to treat it. It is folly, then, to expect
          to treat symptoms with its nosode, and the folly is the more apparent
          when we realize that the character of this nosode is essentially
          changed in the process of potentizing. The only way, therefore, to use
          a nosode is to <i><font color="#0000ff">prove</font></i> it on the
          healthy like any other drug, and note its symptoms in the regular way.</p>

          <br>Shifting pains of a rheumatic character obliging a repeated change
          of position and posture.
          <br>Lancinating rheumatic pains, slightly relieved by a change of
          position at times, and sometimes relieved by motion.
          <br>Pains commence at 2 P. M., gradually increasing till they reach
          their acme at 9 P. M., continuing exceedingly acute till 3 or 4 A. M.,
          subsiding with daybreak.
          <br>Pains more particularly &lt; in, or confined to, the muscles and
          joints of lower limbs, for four or five weeks, then they seemed to go
          to the periosteum and bone itself, consequently becoming deeper and
          more profound.
          <br>The pains produce two sensations, an external one which seems to
          lie in muscles and joints, and an internal one which is deeper and
          much more unbearable, so much so that it seems by its profound nature
          to control the external ones and to cause those pains to disappear,
          afterward reappearing intensified in the external sensation.
          <br>Pains in all the limbs every night after midnight, weary, tired
          pains, making rest impossible, as he could lie nowhere without
          suffering in the part on which he rested.
          <br>Pains worse in lower limbs, much perspiration which partly &gt;.
          <br>Rheumatic neuralgic pains in all the muscles, even in cremaster, <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> in joints&nbsp;; darting pains in
          irregular attacks, sometimes lasting a week or two.
          <br>The pains gradually increase and decrease&nbsp;; they are worse in
          damp and especially in frosty weather&nbsp;; they get worse at 4 or 5
          P. M., attain their height at 2 or 3 A. M., ceasing about 8 A. M.

          to couch for about three years, and for one year was scarcely ever off
          back.
          <br>After the disappearance of the pustular eruption, a gradual
          rigidity of all the joints ensues, and all the flexors seem to become
          contracted and shortened&nbsp;; this causes inability to close the
          fingers on a knife, fork or spoon, and a partial inability to lift the
          foot in order to step up-stairs, except with great difficulty by using
          a cane, and only a step up or down at a time. (Note. This is not the
          case where the pustular eruption is a curative effect of the
          Syphilinum high. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Swan</font></i>).
          <br>Feeling of numbness in palms and sole, which have also at times a
          prickly sensation as if the numb were punctured by a great number of
          needles.
          <br>Slight rigidity of joints.
          <br>Rheumatic swelling of left wrist and left great toe which is
          bluish-red, with pains like sawing off his bones with a dull

          sunrise&nbsp;; no appetite.</p>
