          he seems somewhat pale and nervous when first getting up in the
          morning, but this soon wears off. Is in better flesh. Sac. lac. The

          <br>In September, 1905, I was called to see a little Irish girl, named
          Mary Gilbert, ten years of age, who was suffering with what I thought
          was an attack of pneumonia, temperature 104, a dry cough with severe
          pain in chest.
          <br>I treated her with the usual remedies, Belladonna, Bryonia, etc.,
          with only an apparent amelioration of symptoms.
          <br>But the child lost flesh and seemed to develop an empyema.
          <br>About the third week there was a profuse discharge of foul
          smelling pus-like matter, greenish in color, from mouth.
          <br>The family had been warned by the "household angel" that
          the child would die three successive raps on the door at midnight had
          given the warning.
          <br>They administered holy water and asked for a consulting physician.
          <br>Dr. Pugh, who had attended the mother a year previously, in
          pneumonia, of which she died, was called, made a careful examination
          and left the following note&nbsp;: "I think you are completely
          right."
          <br>She has I think some empyema on right side (not much), but she has
          pulmonary tuberculosis of both lungs.
          <br>I doubt that the hospital would do any good." (Sgd.) <i><font color="#0000ff">Dr. Chas. E. Pugh</font></i>.
          <br>I had thought of sending her to the hospital as she had the
          poorest of care at home&nbsp;; but the doctor said it was of no use,
          nothing could save her.
          <br>I quite agreed with him, but bethought myself of Tuberculinum.
          <br>Here was a chance to try it, surely it could do her no harm.
          <br>She was given a number of doses of the 200, and later higher
          potencies till I reached the cm., and with continual improvement.
          <br>The cough diminished, the hectic spots left her cheeks after a
          number of weeks, but before the real spring came she was a plump and
          rosy child.
          <br>All this, too, in a cold, bad winter and with the most unsanitary
          surroundings.
          <br>The child had previously had what I thought at the time were
          tubercular abscesses, from enlarged cervical glands at the base of the
          neck.
          <br>The family openly said her recovery was a miracle due to prayers
          to St. Anne, and it was a miracle, only the saint was Tuberculinum.
          <br>I heard from little Mary this week and she is well, and I mean
          cured, restored to robust health, not in the least a puny child.
          <br>I always hesitate to use the remedy first hand but have a number
          of times used it after other remedies failed, and with success,
          especially where was a tubercular tendency. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Scholes</font></i>.</p>

          <br>Tuberculinum, a typical case&nbsp;; Howard L., 28 years of age, a
          resident of Attleboro, Mass., was indisposed in the fall of 1898,
          troubled with hoarseness and gastric ailments. A neighbouring
          physician was called who had attended the young man's family for many
          years. This physician commenced in September, 1898, to inject
          Tuberculin (Koch's), and up to December had injected his toxin twice a
          week for several weeks, and then once in two weeks the remainder of
          the time. The result&nbsp;? At the time of the commencement of this
          treatment Mr. L. could work and eat comfortably&nbsp;; soon his
          stomach rebelled against food and the bowels became constipated, his
          hoarseness increased and distressing, suffocative spells set in every
          forenoon, lasting an hour or so&nbsp;; he would then be able to
          breathe well the rest of the day.
          <br>In January, 1899, I was summoned hastily in the night and found
          him laboring for breath, the noise of his breathing audible from the
          street. His first words were&nbsp;: "My God, help me&nbsp;;
          relieve me, Doctor, or I shall die." Expectoration was scanty,
          dark green, lumpy, tubercular matter. Examination of the throat
          revealed a larynx full of tubercular nodes. I saw that his end was
          near, and told his parents with whom he lived I would rather they
          would call their family physician. But as they insisted on my keeping
          the case, I prepared some medicine which relieved him, but the next
          morning he was again worse, and from that time on was in agony from
          efforts to get breath. To relieve him intubation (through the mouth)
          was resorted to, but he could not keep the tube in. He died that
          afternoon, his great agony being &gt; only by resort to chloroform
          applied locally. This man had been wild in his youth, had had
          gonorrhea several times, and of diathesis tubercular. I asked him if
          he had told his former physician these things and he said he had. This
          case is typical as far as the use of Tuberculin by injection is
          concerned, of a score I could mention who have died under the
          hypodermic use of Tuberculin in this vicinity the past two years.</p>
