          Variolinum to hundreds of people, and none of them were ever attacked
          with small-pox.
          <br>In one family where the father had confluent small-pox, he gave
          Variolinum as a prophylactic, and of the others, although not one had
          been vaccinated, not one of them took the disease.
          <br>He reports case of a broker in Philadelphia who was well pitted
          from small-pox&nbsp;; when a child he was vaccinated, and he became
          idiotic in consequence. When sixteen years old he had a violent attack
          of small-pox, after which he recovered his reason.
          <br>Variolinum is indicated in small-pox where there is not much
          pain&nbsp;; the patient can even eat fairly well&nbsp;; the skin looks
          natural between the pustules&nbsp;; the appearance of the eyeball is
          white and natural&nbsp;; the mild uncomplicated cases of small-pox are
          the ones calling for Variolinum.</p>

          appeared on left side of neck, which became sore and itched severely

          areola about an inch in diameter&nbsp;; from the inflamed base were
          light-yellow, ray-like scales, like psoriasis. It ran its course in
          about two weeks. Several similar spots appeared on different parts of
          the body, with intense itching at times, but without systemic
          symptoms. On both, the eruption was similar in character and ran the
          course. Both had been vaccinated years before, but neither had any
