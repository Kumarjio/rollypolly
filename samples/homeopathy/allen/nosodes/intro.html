          <p align="JUSTIFY"><img alt="Dr Henry Clay ALLEN (1836-1909)" src="./intro_files/allenh02.jpg" border="0" align="right" width="211" height="277" hspace="10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Henry C.
          Allen was born [on February 10, 1836] in the village of Nilestown,
          near London, Ontario, and was the son of Hugh and Martha Billings
          Allen. On his paternal side, he was a descendant of that distinguished
          family of Vermonters of the same name, Gen. Ira Allen and Ethan Allen,
          both famous in the revolution. On his maternal side, the Billings'
          were well known among the Colonial families of Massachusetts Bay, and
          one of them, the great-grand-father of Dr. Allen, owned the farm lands
          on which the present city of Salem is built. After selling this
          property, the family moved to Deerfield, in the Connecticut Valley and
          were there at the time the Indians pillaged and ravaged that part of
          the country.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He received his early
          education in the common and grammar schools at London, where he later
          taught school for a time. His medical education was acquired at the
          Western Homeopathic College at Cleveland, Ohio (now the Cleveland
          Homeopathic College), where he graduated in 1861, and later from the
          College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada. Shortly after
          graduation, he entered the Union Army, serving as a surgeon under
          General Grant.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the war he was
          offered and accepted the professorship on Anatomy in his Alma Mater at
          Cleveland, and it was here that he first started practicing medicine.
          Later he resigned and accepted the same chair in the Hahnemann Medical
          College of Chicago. In 1868 he was offered the Chair of Surgery to
          succeed Dr. Beebe, but was unable to accept. He then located in
          Brantford, Ontario, where on December 24th, 1867, he married Selina
          Louise Goold, who, with his two children, Franklin Lyman Allen and
          Helen Marian Allen Aird, survives him. In 1875 he moved to Detroit,
          Michigan, and in 1880, being appointed Professor of Materia Medica at
          the University of Michigan, he moved to Ann Arbor, where he has since
          resided.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1892 he founded
          the Hering Medical College and Hospital, of which he was Dean and
          Professor of Materia Medica until his death, January 22nd, 1909.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Allen was an
          honorable senior of the American Institute of Homeopathy ; a number of
          the International Hahnemannian Association ; of the Illinois
          Homeopathic Medical Association ; of the Englewood Homeopathic Medical
          Society ; of the Regular Homeopathic Medical Society of Chicago ;
          Honorary Vice-President of the Cooper Club of London, England ; and
          Honorary Member of the Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio State
          Medical Societies and Honorary Member of the Homeopathic Society of
          Calcutta, India.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was owner and
          editor of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Medical Advance </font></i>for
          many years. Besides writing many articles in this and other magazines
          he wrote numerous books, among which are the following : <i><font color="#0000ff">Keynotes of Leading Remedies, </font></i>lately placed
          on the <i><font color="#0000ff">Council List of Books </font></i>for
          use in the Canadian Medical Colleges&nbsp;; <i><font color="#0000ff">The
          Homeopathic Therapeutics of Intermittent Fever, The Homeopathic
          Therapeutics of Fevers, Therapeutics of Tuberculous Affections, </font></i>and
          recently completed the revision of Bœnninghausen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Slip Repertory, </font></i>which he brought down to
          date and arranged for rapid and practical work.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This, his latest
          work, a treatise on the Nosodes, was completed only a short time
          before his death, and was the result of years of study, experience,
          and of proving and confirming the symptomatology of many of the
          nosodes. His observations are here published for the first time.</p>

          <p align="CENTER"><font size="4" color="#FF0000">PUBLISHERS' PREFACE.</font></p>
          </b>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is with deep
          regret that the publishers are compelled to offer a preface of their
          own to this great work instead of one by the author, which intervening
          death prevented.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An outline of the
          history of this book, so far as we know it, may be of interest here,
          and indeed is needed. We have no means of knowing when the work was
          started, but, judging from the manuscript, it must have been many
          years ago, for much of the manuscript is old, and bears evidence of
          frequent revision and correction&nbsp;; of the work of painstaking and
          conscientious author.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Close towards the end
          of the year 1908 Dr. Allen wrote us that his work was completed, the
          manuscript had received its final revision, and was ready for the
          compositor. The contracts were made, the manuscript was sent to the
          compositor. Several pages of the first section, <i><font color="#0000ff">Adrenalin</font></i>, were set up and submitted to the
          author for style of type, and arrangement, passed on by him as being
          satisfactory, the compositors were told to go ahead with the work, and
          then when all this was finished, word came of Dr. Allen's death. This
          threw the responsibility of seeing the work through the press, and the
          proof reading, on us. How well this work has been performed the reader
          can judge for himself. We believe it is a good work. Concerning the
          character of this book, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nosodes</font></i>,
          it may be said that Dr. Allen first, last and all the time, regarded
          these drugs as homœopathic, and not as isopathic, remedies&nbsp;;
          that they were to be proved as homœopathic remedies and prescribed
          according to the totality of the symptoms. The preliminary remarks,
          preceding the drugs treated in this book, tell all that we know
          concerning the source of the provings.</p>
          <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Allen placed
          great store by this, his final work, which he, we believe, considered
          his greatest.</p>
