Its symptoms do not last long. It is a violent
        poison in large doses, either destroying life or passing away in its effects quite soon, so
        that if the patient recovers, the recovery is not delayed. There are no chronic diseases
        following it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Like a great storm, it comes and sweeps over and passes away. By a little
        meditation we will discover what kind of sickness all this is like, and what kind of a
        patient is most likely to have that short, sudden sickness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If we think a moment from experience and homoeopathic observation, we
        will remember that vigorous, plethoric individuals, when they take cold, come down
        violently, whereas feeble people, sickly people, come down and recover slowly from acute
        diseases, and do not become so violently and so suddenly sick.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">From this, and from examining the sudden effects of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, it will be easy to see that persons who come down with </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> sicknesses are plethoric individuals.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Strong, robust people, rugged children and infants become sick, not a
        very slight cold, or from slight exposure, but from more violent exposure. From being
        exposed with deficient clothing; from (sudden, violent changes; from prolonged exposure to
        the cold, north, dry wind.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A vigorous person caught out with thin clothing, or remaining out in the
        cold, dry air of mid-winter, with its sudden, violent changes, comes down even before night
        with violent symptoms. This is the class of patients, the plethoric and vigorous, who have a
        strong heart, active brain, vigorous circulation, and come down suddenly from violent
        exposure, that need </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        nature none of the results usually following inflammation. The storm is over so quickly that
        it seems mostly to conform to the earlier condition. In these vigorous patients sudden
        congestions are likely to be thrown off by good reaction.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The patient seems to be threatened with a sudden and violent death, but
        recovery is quick. So, as was observed by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Dunham</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, it is a great storm and soon over. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Dunham's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> discussion of this remedy in his Materia Medica is very poetical and well

        on suddenly from exposure to a dry, cold wind. In plethoric children we have an illustration

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">We get illustrations of its suddenness and violence in any organ of the

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has the lung and brain complaints of winter, and the bowel
        inflammations and stomach disorders of summer. We know how these plethoric individuals
        become suddenly overheated and become violently sick.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Their sudden attacks are frightful to look upon. All these inflammatory
        conditions are attended with great excitement of the circulation, violent action of the
        heart, a tremendous turmoil of the brain, a violent shock. with intense fear.</p>

        out in bold relief.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient feels the violence of his sickness, for he is under great
        nervous irritation and excitement.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Fear is depicted upon his countenance, and the heart's action is so
        overwhelming the first thing he thinks of is that he must die; this must mean death, which
        he fears. It stands out upon his countenance.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He says:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Doctor, there is no use; I am going to die."</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It hardly matters what part of the body we are considering we will find
        inflammatory conditions. But regardless of the region or the locality of the inflammation,
        that which I have described is the appearance of the patient. Such are the symptoms that
        will stand out, that you will observe first - the appearance of the face, the mind symptoms,
        the restlessness, the intensity.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, there are many little mental symptoms that are of much less
        importance than this fear, this anxiety, symptoms that will be masked by these marked
        symptoms that indicate the patient. He has lost all affection for his friends. He does not
        care what becomes of them, he has not the slightest interest in them. It sometimes may be a
        state of indifference.</p>
