        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Introduction</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This
        remedy has been only meagerly proved, yet there are a few useful points in it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">From its proving we can perceive that it is similar to diseased states in
        the human family, and especially in women, namely, hysterical and rheumatic conditions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is always chilly, easily affected by cold, sensitive to cold
        and damp weather, which rouses the rheumatic state and develops a state of rheumatism not
        only in the muscles and joints all over the body, but also along the course of nerves.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the general nervous disturbance there is a lack of will balance, or
        great disturbance in the voluntary system, which is the underlying feature of hysteria, the
        symptoms are intermingled with rheumatism.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With the pains we have soreness all over the body. Trembling, numbness,
        jerking of muscles.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Inability to exercise the will over the muscles of the body, turmoil in
        the voluntary system, with stiffness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tendency to take cold and thereby she takes on sensitiveness in the
        glands and larger organs, such as the liver and uterus.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Complaints in these organs come on from cold damp weather <i>(</i></font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Dulcamara</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">) </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and from being
        chilled.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is sensitive to cold in all parts except the head, and is
        aggravated from becoming cold both in parts of the body and in general.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The headaches, however, are better in the open air and from cold, which
        is an exception and a particular, for the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">general</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">feature is aggravation from cold.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There is a
        terrible mental state that alternates with physical states. It is an overwhelming sadness or
        gloominess, she is bowed down with sorrow.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Sits and mopes in great sadness, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Psorinum </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and
        <i>Pulsatilla</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>.</i></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>
        </i>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This may pass off instantly, or be brought on and aggravated from motion,
        from fear, from excitement, from taking cold.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Very commonly there is </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">muscular soreness, a bruised feeling all over, with drawing and jerking</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This will let up very suddenly and leave a nervous, hysterical girl in a
        state of sadness, and she will sit and say nothing. When questioned perhaps she will break
        into tears or ex press in various ways the overwhelming sadness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With the headache there is marked sadness. Changeable moods. The physical
        and the mental are all the time changing. Other symptoms alternate and change.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The jerking has made physicians see the resemblance to chorea in these
        hysterio-rheumatic constitutions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The rheumatisms will change in a day into chorea, and again the choreic
        movements will keep on with the soreness throughout the muscles of the body.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The jerking and soreness and numbness often keep on together.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are certain features about the chorea that should be noted. Jerking
        of the muscles when in a state of emotion or from becoming chilled. If any part of the body
        is pressed upon jerking of the muscles of that part will take place.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">One of these nervous, rheumatic, hysterical subjects may not have chorea
        constantly, but as soon as she retires at night the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">whole of the side lain on will commence to jerk and prevent her from going
        to sleep. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If she turns on the back
        the muscles of the back and shoulders will jerk and prevent sleep.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She turns over on the other side, but after a little while the muscles
        pressed on commence to jerk. All this time she has become so restless and nervous that she
        is driven to distraction.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind is full of all sorts of imaginations and the body is full of all
        sorts of uneasiness, because she can find no place to rest upon.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes the muscles are so sore that they cannot be lain upon for any
        length of time; sometimes it is a numbness, sometimes a jerking.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These things are queer, but they belong to the patient, affecting not one
        part, but the whole economy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Full of fear, anguish and restlessness. Fear of death, excitement,
        suspicious, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"Will not even take the
        medicine because there is, something wrong about it" .</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has a mania such as occurs in nervous, hysterical women, and it has
        cured puerperal mania.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Puerperal mania from taking cold during or soon after confinement. The
        remedy belongs especially to women, because its symptoms are so commonly associated with the
        affections of women.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mental states following the disappearance of rheumatism is a strong
        feature. The rheumatism gets better, but the mental state becomes worse.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes the rheumatism disappears in short order and the mind is not
        disturbed, but then it is because a diarrhea has come on, with great soreness and aching in
        the bowels, or because a flow from the uterus has given relief.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There must be some relief or a disturbance will take place like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Abrotanum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Some flow must be
        established, and hence the menstrual flow or diarrhea gives relief; otherwise the mind takes
        on trouble, the patient becomes gloomy, or has a low form of mental excitement.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">One of the symptoms is quite descriptive of this sadness I have referred
        to:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sensation as if a black cloud had settled all over her," while
        at the same time it weighed like "lead upon the head."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This is entirely figurative. It can all be expressed in the word "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">sadness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">".</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We will find "melancholy," "gloominess ... .. low
        spirited," etc., running all through out text, but the word "sadness" is just
        as broad as any of them.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Head</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The headaches
        are rheumatic.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Yet most of these headaches are better by being in the cold air.</p>

        pass now to the female genitalia, which form a center for a great deal of trouble in the
        remedy. A routine saying about </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Actea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is that it makes confinement easy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is not a legitimate saying concerning any remedy and such
        expressions encourage routine practice. It is true that when this remedy has been given to
        pregnant women in accordance with its symptoms it has proved capable of making confinement
        easy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the way it has been given has been the routine practice of giving it
        in the tincture or in the 2d or 3d, until the patient was under its influence even when it
        was not indicated, as it was not similar to the case.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the homoeopathic physician never practices in this way. A remedy fits
        a general condition when the symptoms of that general condition are found in the remedy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Remember that it does so because <i>all the symptoms agree.</i></p><i>

        and pressing out."</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These bearing down sensations, taken with all the other states that
        relate to the patient in general, show that it is a very useful remedy in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">prolapsus of the uterus.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It has the relaxation of the parts. Do not suppose that our remedies are
        not sufficient to cure these conditions, </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">when the symptoms agree.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is true that remedies will cure prolapsus when the

        <p align="JUSTIFY">If it fits the patient in general, these bearing down sensations will go
        away, the patient will be made comfortable, and an examination will finally show that the
        parts are in normal condition. You cannot prescribe for the prolapsus; you must prescribe
        for the woman. You cannot prescribe for one symptom, because there are probably fifty
        remedies that have that symptom.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are menstrua! disorders in these hysterical rheumatic

        peculiar. Generally the flow will relieve pain, but with this remedy the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">pain is during the flow</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Generally
        the most severe and most painful attack is at the beginning of the flow, and with some women

        <p align="JUSTIFY">So markedly do her troubles alternate with each other that alternation is
        in the nature of her case. You will commonly find that all the rest of her troubles have
        passed away, and that now nausea has come on. In all the years past she has had a hysterical
        constitution, but now when she is pregnant she has nausea all the time.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You will find when one set of symptoms becomes extremely severe others

        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the symptoms have to be taken collectively to get at the image of the
        patient. A woman will come to you with one group of symptoms today and may come back to you
        with an entirely different group in a couple of weeks.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These are very troublesome cases to prescribe for, and you have sometimes
        to take the symptoms a dozen times and put them all together as if she had felt them all in
        one day, and so make your prescription.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A hysterical patient is difficult to manage because of this changing of
        symptoms, and also because she has a tendency to deceive the doctor.</p>

        symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A pain comes on and it seems to be about to finish satisfactorily; it has
        been regular and prolonged until about two-thirds through, and all at once she screams out
        and grasps her hip-the pain has left the uterus and gone to the hip, causing a cramp in the
        hip, and she has to be rubbed and turned over.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This medicine will regulate the pains, and when the next pain comes it
        will hold on to the end.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So impressionable is this woman during confinement that if she is
        subjected to any emotion - such as having an emotional story told in the room - or if
        anything excitable occurs, the pain will stop.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If she has passed through the labor and the lochia has been established,
        from such a cause the lochia will stop, as if she had taken cold, and she will have cramps

        over, and have fever.</p>
