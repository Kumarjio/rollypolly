        mental symptoms are the most important in a proving, so are the mental symptoms in sickness
        the most important.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        to pay most attention to the symptoms of the mind, because the symptoms of the mind
        constitute the man himself.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The highest and innermost symptoms are the most important, and these are
        the mind symptoms.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aesculus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has not been
        brought out in the finest detail, but we have the key to it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Extreme irritability is the very general state from which ramify a great
        many mental symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Irritability and mental depression run through a great many remedies, and
        form the centre around which revolve all the mental symptoms in some cases.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The reason that these are more interior than some other symptoms of the
        mind is that these relate to the affections themselves.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mental symptoms can be classified in a remedy. The things that relate
        to the memory are not so important as the things that relate to the intelligence, and the
        things that relate to the intelligence are not so important as the things that relate to the
        affections or desires and aversions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We see in a state of irritability that the patient is not irritable while
        doing the things that he desires to do; if he wants to be talked to, for instance, you do
        not discover his irritability while talking to him.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You never discover he is irritable if you do the things he wants you to
        do. But just as soon as you do something he does not want, this irritability or disturbance
        of the will is brought on, and this is the very innermost of the man’s state.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That which he wishes belongs to that which he wills, and the things that
        relate to what he wills and the most important things in every proving.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You may say that an individual is sad, but he is sad because he lacks
        something that he wants; he desires something which he has not and becomes sad for it;
        sadness may go on to such an extent that the mind is in confusion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Confusion of mind and vertigo. Make this distinction, vertigo is not
        confusion of the intelligence.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You have only to meditate upon it a moment and you will see that it is
        not.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Confusion of the mind is a disturbance of the intellect, not disturbance
        of the sensorium; you will make a distinction between staggering when walking and a period
        of disturbance of the mind, with inability to think clearly.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Vertigo is a sensation of rolling, and belongs to the sensorium. A great
        mistake has been made in some of our repertories, in that confusions of mind are placed with
        vertigo under sensorium.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These things must be thought out carefully, so that we are clear in our
        own minds as to what symptoms mean when they are given to us by patients.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A patient may state that when walking in the street he is dizzy or that
        it appears as though everything interiorly were turning around, yet he may be perfectly able
        to add up a column of figures; his mind may be clear.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If we ourselves are perfectly clear as to the meaning of these
        expressions, we will commonly glean the meaning of the patient. It is important to record
        the language of the patient, yet often a patient will say something which you can see he
        does not mean at all, and it then becomes necessary to put in a parenthesis what he really
        means. For instance, a patient says:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"I have such a pain in my chest</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," with the band on the abdomen, or a woman when menstruating will say
        the pain is in the stomach when you know it is in the uterus.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Patients must be questioned oftentimes as to their statements, or
        requested to place the hand upon the painful part. In the same way, therefore, patients talk
        about dizziness when they are not dizzy at all, but feel a confusion of mind, or they speak
        of confusion of mind when they mean that they stagger in the street.</p>
