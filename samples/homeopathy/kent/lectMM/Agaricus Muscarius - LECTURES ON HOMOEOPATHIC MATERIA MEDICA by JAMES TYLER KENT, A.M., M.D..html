        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The most
        striking things running through this medicine are twitchings and tremblings, jerkings of the
        muscles and trembling of the limbs; quivering and tremors, everywhere these two features are
        present in all parts of the body and limbs.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The twitching of the muscles becomes so extensive that it is a
        well-developed case of chorea. It has in its nature all that is found in chorea and has
        cured many cases. This is a general belonging to all parts to all muscles.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Throughout the body there is a sensation of creeping and crawling. It is
        hardly confined to the skin, it is felt as if in the flesh, a sensation as if of ants.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Itching of the skin all over which changes place from scratching. No
        place is exempt from this. There are strange sensations here and there upon the skin or in
        parts, cold sensations, sensations of cold needles and of hot needles; stinging and burning
        where the circulation is feeble, about the ears, nose, back of hands and fingers and toes,
        red spots with itching and burning as if frostbitten. It is a great remedy for chilblains.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is extremely nervous and sensitive to cold. Itching,
        pricking, tingling, etc., come on from mental exertion and are relieved from physical
        exertion.</p>

        especially in the symptoms of the spinal cord. It is useful for the symptoms which come on

        development.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Children who cannot remember, make mistakes and are slow in learning.
        Nervous patients who on going over their manuscripts find out their mistakes in writing and
        spelling.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The condition of the mind is one in which they are slow to grasp ideas;
        wrong words float in kaleidoscopically.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The whole mind and sensorium seem paralyzed; the patient is sluggish,
        stupid, at times seems to be delirious; there is confusion of the mind so nearly like
        delirium that it is not unlike intoxication.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A delirium such as is produced by alcohol. He also becomes silly, says
        foolish and silly things, sings and whistles at an inopportune time, makes verses and
        prophesies; or he lapses into an opposite state, becomes indifferent to Ids surroundings.
        One who is mild and placid becomes self-willed, obstinate and conceited.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Difficulty in coordinating the movements of the muscles of the body.
        Incoordination of brain and spinal cord. Clumsy motion of the fingers and hands. In handling
        things she drops them. Fingers fly open spasmodically while holding things.</p>

        near the fire, while </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> she wants to get out of the kitchen. The awkwardness,
        clumsiness, etc., are both mental and bodily.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Every sort of change is rung on the patient and the doctor. At times the

        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the morning he is tired and sluggish and this may last till noon. The
        mental symptoms are worse in the morning and are relieved towards evening.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All jerkings and twitchings subside during sleep. There is vertigo when
        walking in the open air. He is always chilly. On undertaking to do something he does the
        opposite. Vertigo and confusion of mind are mixed up.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Head</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It is a common
        feature for the headaches of this remedy to be associated with the spinal symptoms, the
        quivering and jerking.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Headaches in spinal patients. Pain as though sharp ice touched the head,
        or as if from cold needles. - That is general; we find it in other parts.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pain in the head as if from a nail. There is some bleeding in the
        morning, and the blood is thick, black and will hardly drop. Coldness in the head.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the scalp there are all sorts of queer sensations; icy coldness after
        itching or scratching. That runs all through the body. There is itching, although no
        eruption is visible; can't let it alone, and after scratching there is a sensation of icy
        coldness in the part or as if the wind was blowing on it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The head is in constant motion as in chorea. Itching of the scalp,
        especially in the morning on rising.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There again we have the general aggravation in the morning. There are
        marked eruptions on the scalp. Eczema with crusts.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Twitching and
        jerking of the eyes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will observe this about the Agaricus eyes; as the patient looks at
        you there is a pendulum like action of the eyes, they go back and forth all the time; they
        oscillate, though he tries his best to fix his look on you.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This stops only during sleep; all the motions subside during sleep. A few
        other medicines have cured this eye symptom, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cicuta, <i>Arsenicum, Sulphur, </i>Pulsatilla, but Agaricus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> also produces and cures it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is every conceivable kind of deception in colors and in vision.
        Flickering before the eyes; he reads with difficulty. Objects seem to be where they are not.
        Black flies before the eyes; black motes; sees double; floating flies before the eyes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Muscular weakness of the eyes. Irregularity of the motions of the eyes;
        pupils dilated; pupils contracted. Sensation as of a mist or cobweb before the eyes.
        Spasmodic twitching and jerking. The jerkings and twitchings are the most marked symptoms,
        as also the choreic movements about the eyes, and the deceptions in colors and figures
        before the eyes.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Ears</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Redness, burning
        and itching of the ears as if they had been frostbitten.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The sensation as of chilblains, the same sensation as found throughout;
        the same itching and tingling as of the remedy in general. Dullness of hearing. Deafness.
        Hearing acute. in the morning he is dumb, sluggish, stupid, tired, but when evening comes he
        brightens up, becomes warmed up, becomes excited, poetical and prophetical, wants to sit up
        late at night, is brilliant, wants to play games.</p>

        most inveterate chronic catarrhs with dryness and crusts, in tubercular constitutions, so
        deep-seated is it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It has cured many cases of incipient phthisis. It cures old coughs and
        catarrhs. Red nose, as if frostbitten.

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: From what we
        have already seen we expect twitching of the muscles of the face, and itching and redness
        and burning as if frostbitten, paralytic weakness, etc., because these are general features,
        and just as we expect we see these things in the text.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Choreic spasms. Expression as of idiocy. Now notice this: some patients
        when going on with their own usual vocation are pretty smart, but if you put some new idea
        before them, something not in the routine of their work, they are perfectly idiotic.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is especially noticeable in the morning. He can't take in anything
        new in the morning, but he is able to take in new ideas and is bright in the evening, like
        the effect produced by tea and coffee and alcoholic beverages.</p>
