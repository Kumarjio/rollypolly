        <p align="JUSTIFY">This wonderful remedy is often overlooked. It should come to mind for old
        sufferers who are broken from sexual excesses and secret vice.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pale sickly and sad mortals who lament over their misspent life. It
        is good for both sexes.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Sexual</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Sexual
        weakness; relaxation of parts. Perversion of all the functions.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A woman who indulged extensively in secret vice, found after marriage
        that she had no sexual thrill, was cured by this remedy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Later she was confined and no milk came in her mammae, again </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Agnus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> started the belated milk at the end of three weeks.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When the milk ceases after it has started, or becomes scanty when the
        above history is known, and the woman is said, this remedy will, if not opposed, most likely
        cure.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It cures uterine haemorrhage, and restores suppressed menses in young
        women with a history. The vagina is much relaxed, there is often prolapsus, and there is a
        copious white-of-egg-like leucorrhoea.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the pitiful, woebegone young man, heart-broken over his early life,
        now finds himself newly married, and impotent.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He has had gonorrhoea; he has lived in excesses, and now suffers from
        relaxed and cold genitalia, emissions, prostatic discharge at stool.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">His young and beautiful wife excites no erection, though only recently he
        had a clandestine success, and he has morning erections but no more.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Out of the above cause and condition come many distressing symptoms.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Loss of memory,
        despair, suicidal thoughts, anxiety, fear and peevishness. These patients suffer from
        headaches, photophobia and nervous symptoms too numerous to mention. Formication of the
        skin.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tearing pains of head, face and teeth. All but the simplest food
        disorders the stomach, and he complains much of nausea. His muscles are flabby.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is anemic, and his glands are enlarged, especially, the spleen. lie is
        growing increasingly flatulent.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The abdominal viscera hang down as a weight. There is a growing weakness
        of the rectum and constipation, and he presses hard at stool, which often fails and slips
        back, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Silica, Sanic </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and <i>Thuja.</i></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000"><i>
        </i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The stool is large and hard. Itching, smarting at the anus, noisy flatus
        of a urinous odor. Excoriated anus. He soon takes on a hacking cough and night sweats.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The limbs are tired and cold. He is sensitive to cold, and wants to
        remain quiet. Exertion and motion intensify his complaints.</p>
        </font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He has been to many advisers, and they have told him he has </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Neurasthenia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He must have </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Agnus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> castus.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
