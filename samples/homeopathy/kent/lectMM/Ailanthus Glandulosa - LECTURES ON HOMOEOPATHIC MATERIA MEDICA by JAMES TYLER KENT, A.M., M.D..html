        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This
        medicine is especially suitable in the low zymotic forms of sickness, such as we find in
        diphtheria and scarlet fever, in blood poisoning and in symptomatic typhoids, especially
        those cases that are characterized by capillary congestion in spots, red mottled spots.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Scarlet</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Perhaps the
        most striking manifestation of such a low type of sickness is malignant scarlet fever. The
        regular rash does not come out, but in its place red spots, roseola-like, make their
        appearance; the usual uniform spread of the eruption has failed, or has been suppressed, and
        there is bleeding from the gums and nose, and dreadful tumefaction in the throat.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The countenance is purple and besotted, the eyes are congested and there
        is even bleeding from the eyes. There is an appearance of great prostration, but it is
        really stupefaction; he seems stupid and benumbed.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If you look at the throat you see it is covered with little purple
        patches, intermingled with an oedematous appearance similar to that found in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is a low
        depressed type of sickness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">De composition of the blood is going on rapidly. The blood that oozes is
        black. The child is going into a state of stupor and it is with difficulty that he can be
        aroused. Sometimes blisters are formed on the ends of fingers, or here and there over the
        body. From the mouth and nose come foetid odors. The child is going as rapidly as possible
        into a form of malignant disease.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes the disease comes on as a light febrile attack, but from taking
        cold and suppressing some of the natural manifestations the case takes on a low typhoid form
        and whereas you had at first only a simple remittent, the case has now assumed a state of
        prostration with a very rapid heart, foetor, purpleness or blueness, a passive congestion
        with purple blotches of the skin, causing a mottled appearance.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When a disease turns so suddenly blood poisoning is going on and a
        symptomatic typhoid state appears. A remittent that turns into a sharp zymotic state in the
        course of twenty-four hours, a diphtheria that takes on this form with stupidity and mottled
        skin are examples of such a type of sickness.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The mental
        symptoms accompanying this state are interesting. I read from some nows I have made. A
        continued dreamy state of mind though awake. Child cries all the time. Sees little animals
        like rats running around.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Feels a rat or something small crawling up the limb and over the body.
        There seems to be constant loss of memory, even the things spoken of a moment ago go right
        out of the mind. Constant forgetfulness. All past events are forgotten. Past events are
        forgotten or remembered as belonging to someone else, or as matters read.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is in keeping with the dreamy state, it seems as though those things
        that are past appear as in a dream, as if he had dreamed them. Cannot concentrate the mind
        in any mental effort; cannot answer questions correctly; is as if in a semi-conscious state,
        and finally he goes into complete unconsciousness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is in the earlier stages of this zymotic state great anxiety and
        restlessness, later there is stupor and indifference to everything. Continual sighing with
        depression of spirits; extremely irritable, semi-conscious, finally unconsciousness, stupor,
        delirium and insensibility; muttering delirium with sleeplessness and restlessness.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This mental state is such as occurs in zymotic sickness; the chronic
        illness has not been well brought out. Dr. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Wells</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> used this remedy in
        a number of cases, as it was at that time an epidemic remedy for scarlet fever, in Brooklyn,
        and many patients were saved by it. It seemed to be able to change the character of the
        malignant forms of scarlet fever into a mild type.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In addition to
        the symptoms of the text it has been observed that the hair falls out and flashes of light
        play before the eyes on closing the lids at night.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pupils widely dilated; copious, thin, ichorous and bloody,
        discharge from the nose."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is in the zymotic states in scarlet fever.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Nostrils congested. Great prostration and a countenance indicating
        much distress. Face dark as mahogany."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is in suppressed scarlet fever. Purple, bloated and puffed, besotted
        face. This remedy is one not very much used, and it is not very often indicated, but it is
        very useful when indicated. You will not very often see this particular type even in
        malignant scarlet fever. You will often see such a scarlet fever running to a number of
        other remedies, but this remedy corresponds to one of the most malignant types, and its
        commonest use will be in an epidemic in which the cases largely run to the malignant type.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are three common types of scarlet fever. In one season you find the
        cases are mild and simple, the typical eruption is present and comes on speedily without any
        great amount of fever. Such cases will often run their course with good nursing, a warm room
        and plenty of clothing without much medicine.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The skin is
        bright red, smooth and shiny. The case is not serious. In other epidemics you will find only
        an isolated case of this kind, while the majority of cases present marked trouble in the
        throat; the rash is scanty when present, and congestion of the head and spinal symptoms come
        on with pain in the back of the neck.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Throat</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The throat is
        dreadfully swollen and inflamed, bright red and very painful. Then there is a third type in
        which the throat is severely swollen, all the mucous membranes are swollen, and the whole
        tendency is toward ad poisoning or zymosis with enlargement of the glands, puffiness of the
        skin and a great deal of fetor; the skin is dusky and the eruption is scanty, sometimes
        hardly visible from beginning to end.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These cases will almost all die if let alone; they are very serious. The
        old authors call these three forms "scarlatina simplex, scarlatina anginosa," and
        "scarlatin. maligna."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In some epidemics you will see all three of the appearances; in some
        families you will see two forms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">One child will have a mild in type, and another will have it more
        severely with zymotic blisters here and there, on the ends of the fingers, and these will be
        attended with foetor; as soon as the blisters break ulceration will take place if the child
        live long enough; but these are the deadly cases, the malignant type.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Even when the rash does not come out in the low forms of scarlet fever,
        the impression of the finger makes a white mark which will be slow to fill up. The more
        marked that is, the lower the type. The more zymotic the type the more sluggish the
        circulation, and in this remedy especially is this state present.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The congested condition of the skin is present even when there is no
        rash, a passive congestion of the veins.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Quite a number of medicines have that, but <i>Veratrum viride </i>produces
        such a vaso-motor paralysis that a line upon the skin made by pressure will remain a long
        time. In all these zymotic complaints there is a foetid odor that is sometimes cadaveric,
        sometimes like stinking meat; this will be found in the low types of disease where this
        remedy is indicated.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Throat much swollen, dark red, almost purple in color. Diphtheria
        with extreme prostration. Throat livid, swollen; tonsils prominent and studded with deep
        ulcers."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The throat and tonsils very often appear as if they would pit upon
        pressure like a dropsical state. In some of these zymotic cases where a reaction ought to
        take place a diarrhea sets in that is horribly offensive; a critical diarrhea. With these
        zymotic states there is pain in the back of the neck and head no matter what the name of the
        disease is.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Breathing hurried, irregular, heavy. Burning in the palms and
        soles, hunts to find a cool place to put them. Feels a rat running up the leg. Feeling as if
        a snake crawled up the leg."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These mental symptoms occurred in one of my provers. In low, adynamic
        forms of disease characterized by sudden and extreme prostration,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Vomiting, pulse small and rapid purplish appearance of skin."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Electric thrill from brain to extremities."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Chill at 8 A.M. with chill, heat and sweat."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">During the chill vomiting of food and piercing pain over the hip. Chill
        is preceded by malignant eruption, especially on the face and forehead.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"During chill hunger, empty feeling, intolerable pain in back of
        neck, upper part of back and hip joint."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That pain in the back of the neck is a common forerunner of low types of
        fever. It generally precedes a congestive attack of great violence characterized by fullness
        of the head with heat.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This miliary
        rash spoken of in the text, looking like measles, is when the scarlet fever rash or the
        measles rash does not come out in its uniform fashion, but in patches, little circles here
        and there and is dark.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Irregular, patchy, livid eruption, disappearing on pressure and
        return ing very slowly; interspersed with small vesicles, worse on forehead, head, neck and
        chest. Eruption appeared scantily for two days with sore throat and mild fever" .</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This eruption is like the petechiae that we see, in typhoid forms of
        disease. The record of this remedy in scarlet fever makes it worthy of further study; it
        ought to be reproved that we may have a fuller understanding of it.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Eruption plentiful, of a bluish tint. Typhoid scarlatina."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Eruption is slow to make its appearance, remains livid."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Body and limbs covered with an irregular patchy eruption of a very
        livid color."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Here you see but one type of scarlet fever. This low type of fever
        sometimes needs </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sulphur</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">or </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phosphorus, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">or <i>Belladonna, </i>or <i>Baptisia, </i>or <i>Lachesis</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>. </i>That you may be able to distinguish one from
        the other and keep the picture of each remedy clearly in mind requires a prolonged study of
        the Materia Medica.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is an easy matter to compare remedies for yourself after you have
        first studied each one separately.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You can then bring out many comparisons, and especially in this case at
        the bed side. If you go to the bedside with a good knowledge of the generals of Materia
        Medica you will be surprised at the number of symptom pictures which will come into your
        mind, called up by the signs of the sickness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When you go to the bedside of scarlet fever you should not call to mind
        the names of these medicines you may have heard recommended for scarlet fever; let the
        appearance of the patient bring to mind such remedies as appear like this patient,
        regardless of whether they have been associated with scarlet fever or not.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When you see the rash perhaps you will say that looks like an </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">rash but there is
        such scanty zymosis in the nature of <i>Aconite </i>that it is no longer thought of.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Belladonna</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">not suitable, for in that remedy the rash is shiny and
        smooth, the typical </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sydenham</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> rash.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">On the other hand, you will say </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pulsatilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">has a measly rash, and often associated with a low
        form of fever, but not so low as the typhoid type, so </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pulsatilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">goes out of your mind.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You now think of the remedies that are typical of all zymotic states; the
        prostration, the aggravation after sleep, general stupor and delirium, and almost at a
        glance you see </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">the type of such forms of disease.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Its picture comes into your mind speedily. You see another case of
        scarlet fever where there is a scanty rash, the child before you keeps on picking the skin
        from the lips and nose, lies in a state of pallor and exhaustion, no rash to speak of, urine
        nearly suppressed; almost in a moment you think of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arum triph</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is the aspect of things that will call the remedy to the mind. In
        another case you have all the purple appearance I have spoken of in this remedy; horrible
        foetor a good deal of sore throat, and the child cannot get water cold enough, wants a
        stream of water running down the throat all the time; you may safely trust to </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phosphorus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="justify">In these low types of sickness there is always something to tell the
        story if you will only listen, study and wait long enough.</p>
