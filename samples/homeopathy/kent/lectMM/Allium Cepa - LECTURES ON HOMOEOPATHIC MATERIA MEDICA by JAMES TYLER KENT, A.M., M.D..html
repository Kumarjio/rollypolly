        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is not strange that the old ladies used to bind onions on the ear for
        earache and around the neck for sore throats, for onion is very frequently indicated in
        almost every climate for the effects of cold.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Cold, damp, penetrating winds, in any climate, are likely to bring on </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> complaints-coryza, Ia grippe, influenza or whatever they may be called, and
        usually there is congestive headache.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Coryza</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Rawness in the
        nose, copious flow of water from the eyes, which is always bland; copious watery discharge
        from the nose, which is always excoriating.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Rawness in the larynx and throat, extending down into the chest. Raw in
        the nose. In twenty-four hours it reaches the larynx.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cough, excited by tickling in the larynx and when lying down at night in
        a warm room.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">On going to bed in the evening </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has its most
        troublesome aggravation.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I have heard patients describe the pain in the larynx on coughing, saying
        that it felt as if someone was reaching down with a hook at every cough.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Tearing in the larynx with every cough. Sneezing, rawness of all the
        mucous membranes and that tearing cough, all symptoms worse in a warm room and in the even
        ing; it is astonishing how quickly the onion will break up that "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">cold</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now we will take up the particulars of the coryza. Among the earlier
        symptoms will be the sneezing, which comes with increasing frequency. A watery discharge
        drips from the nose constantly, burns like fire, and excoriates the upper lip and the wings
        of the nose until there are rawness and redness.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Notice that the fluid from the nose is excoriating and the fluid from the
        eyes bland. Bear that in mind, for when we come to study </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Euphrasia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">we will find just the opposite.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">We will find just such a watery discharge from the nose and such copious
        lachrymation; but the lachrymation is acrid and the discharge from the nose bland. The nasal
        discharge of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> fairly eats the hair off of the upper lip. And there
        is so much congestion that the patient has a sensation of fullness in the nose, with
        throbbing and burning, and sometimes nosebleed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains through the jaws, in the face; and these pains extend into the
        head. Dull frontal headaches, occipital headaches; headaches very severe and the eyes cannot
        stand the light; tearing, bursting, throbbing in the head.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, there is another phase of this medicine. Why it begins the left side
        and goes over to the right nose, I do not know, but it usually does this.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Stuffing up of the side of the nose, watery, acrid discharge from the
        left side of the nose - in another twenty-four hours the right side is invaded.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Profuse nasal discharge. Colds after damp north easterly
        winds."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is, after damp, cold winds, for they may come from different
        directions in different localities. Fluent coryza with headache, tears from the eyes, want
        of appetite, cough and trembling in the open air.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Every year in August, morning coryza, with violent sneezing, very
        sensitive to the odor of flowers and skin of peaches."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That is one form of hay fever cured by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. It will wipe
        out an attack of hay fever in a few days, when the symptoms agree.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You may know that the true nature of hay fever is not generally
        understood. It is really only an explosion of chronic disease, that is, it is a
        manifestation of psora, and can be eradicated only by antipsoric treatment. Many a time have
        I seen hay fever wiped out in one season by a short-acting remedy, only to return the next
        just the same, and perhaps another remedy will be required.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Psora</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: As soon as the
        hay fever is stopped you must begin with constitutional treatment. There will be symptoms,
        if you know how to hunt for them, that differ altogether from the acute attack. When the hay
        fever is on these do not appear.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a difficult matter to find a constitutional remedy when the hay
        fever is at its height, for it resembles an acute disease; but it is a manifestation of
        psora, like an other manifestation of psora, as eruptions, cough, etc.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The nose may manifest only a certain phase of chronic disease in one
        season which may, for instance, be suited to Allium cepa. I remember one time having
        occasion to prescribe </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> at long distance. it was near a homoeopathic
        pharmacy. I wired the pharmacist to send my patient </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, and he
        labeled it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Well, the patient kept the bottle and used it next season, but it did no
        good. That is likely to be the case, even when the symptoms seem to agree. In a psoric
        condition a short-acting remedy is insufficient; it may help for one day only, and the
        deep-acting remedy that includes the patient as well as the hay fever and all the other
        symptoms will have to be administered.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The best time to treat hay fever is after the acute attack subsides and
        until it begins again the next season. It will then occur in a greatly modified form,
        different from any the patient has ever had, and calling for a different remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That will be the case if the constitutional remedy has been properly
        selected.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In these coryzas the inflammation soon spreads to the ears, the throat
        and the larynx.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Earache</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The old
        mothers used to put onions on the baby's ear when it had earache. That is not surprising,
        when we see all the pains and aches belonging to this remedy. Jerking pains from the throat
        toward the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Eustachian</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> tube. Violent earache, even to the discharge of pus
        from the car. Ringing in the ears. Stitches towards the ear from the forehead. Pain like
        thick threads drawing from deep within the head. Stitching, tearing pains in the ear, with
        whooping cough, with coryza, with laryngitis.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In the household where a medicine case is kept, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pulsatilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is
        the standard remedy for earache, and it is true that only occasionally has a doctor to be
        sent for. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pulsatilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has such a strong affinity for the ear that it will
        cure earache in almost all sensitive children who cry pitifully. But those who are snappish,
        who are never suited, who will throw away something they have asked for and slap the nurse
        in the face must have </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pulsatilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla
        and Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> you can cure the majority
        of earaches in children.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Further, as to
        the eye-symptoms that accompany the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium
        cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> colds, remember that the discharge
        from the eye is bland. Although there is burning in the eyes the tears do not excoriate as
        they flow down over the cheek. Profuse, bland lachrymation. Lachrymation in the evening in a
        warm room.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Colic</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: We all know
        what a flatulent vegetable the onion is. It is a wonderful medicine for babies with colic.
        Cutting, rending, tearing pains, drawing the poor little thing almost double. It screams
        with the violent cutting in the lower abdomen.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stitching pains in the abdomen."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Colicky pains beginning in the hepatic region and spreading over
        the whole abdomen, worse around the navel; worse when sitting."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Wind colic. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium
        cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a wonderful remedy in whooping
        cough, and when it is indicated the child will often have indigestion, vomiting and
        flatulency; will pass offensive flatus, will be doubled up with colic. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> also cures a ragged, sensitive condition of the anus, with bleeding, in
        infants.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Voice and larynx</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        Acute complaints of the voice; catarrhal hoarseness; copious expectoration of mucus from the
        larynx. Violent inflammation of the larynx coming on very rapidly, with that cough I spoke
        of, and the tearing in the larynx.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Some will describe it as a sensation as if something were being torn
        loose. Those who describe more accurately will say that it feels as if a hook were dragging
        up through the larynx with every cough.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tickling in the larynx with hoarseness. In the whooping cough there is
        this same painfulness of the larynx. The child shakes and shudders and you can see that it
        dreads the cough because of the tearing pain in the larynx.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cough and difficult breathing from inspiring cold-air, yet a warm draft
        will so increase the tickling that it is sure to set the patient coughing. So the cough is
        aggravated both by cold air and a warm room.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Colds sometimes travel down into the bronchial tubes and are attended
        with fever and rapid pulse. If the tickling in the larynx, the cough from inspiring the cold
        air, worse in a warm room and in the evening, with tearing pain in the larynx, are present, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will cure.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The cough is spasmodic and resembles croup or whooping cough. Cepa has a
        record for croupy cough.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The old lady binds onion on the throat of the child with croup, and no
        doubt, out in the back woods, where there are no doctors, it was far better than Old School
        treatment.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is a fairly good description from the Guiding Symptoms:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Hoarse, harsh, ringing, spasmodic cough, excited by constant
        tickling in the larynx; cough produces a raw, splitting pain in the larynx, so acute and so
        severe as to compel the patient to crouch from suffering and to make every effort to
        suppress the cough."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Severe, laryngeal cough, which compels the patient to grasp the
        larynx; feels as if cough would tear it."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The child will reach up to the larynx and clutch it. This is wholly
        different from the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">condition, when the child, after exposure to a dry, cold wind, wakes before
        midnight with a hoarse, barking cough, and clutches the larynx.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">So </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> cannot be substituted for </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Allium cepa</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="justify"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Traumatic neuritis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        Another affection over which this remedy has marvellous power is traumatic neuritis, often
        met with in a stump after amputation. The pains are almost unbearable, rapidly exhausting
        the strength of the patient.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
