        they begin to walk, will drop all over the carpet, involuntarily, little yellow drops of
        mucus and faeces. The mother sometimes punishes the little ones, but they cannot help it,

        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a lack of control of the sphincter. This state is not always

        little, hard, round marble-like pieces of stool. They do not even know the stool has passed.
        There is relaxation about the rectum and protrusion of the anus, with bleeding piles. Every

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The text of the earlier writers speaks of it as a sputtering, for while

        sometimes do cure strictures. If they can cure the patient it is marvelous how nature will
        take up all that inflammatory tissue and the canal become normal. This thing has been seen
        many times in stricture of the urethra and stricture of the rectum.</p>
