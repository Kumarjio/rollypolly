        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Weakness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This
        medicine, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">seems to produce a peculiar kind of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Paralytic weakness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">of the muscles in all parts of the body, a sort of
        lack of tone.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The extremities are weak. This weakness is felt especially in the rectum
        and bladder. The stool becomes impacted from want of ability of the rectum and colon to
        expel their contents.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The bladder is also slowed down in its action, and it is with great
        difficulty that the urine is voided. After urinating, the bladder often remains half full.
        The urine is very slow to start, and when the patient stands to urinate the urine falls down
        perpendicularly, as in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hepar</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">From this we see the sluggish action. The paralytic condition extends also
        to the veins producing a vaso-motor paralysis.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Induration</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Another
        peculiar condition running through the remedy is the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">tendency to induration</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">wherever there is an inflamed surface.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All remedies that have this in their nature relate more or less to
        cancerous affections, because in cancer we have as the most natural feature a tendency to
        induration.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Ulcers are common in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, and this induration underlies the ulcer; ulcers with
        indurated base. Or little scales may appear upon the skin where the circulation is feeble,
        over cartilaginous portions for instance and a great thick indurated mass forms.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Infiltration takes place under this crust, the crust keeps coming off,
        and a lack of healing follows because of the weakness of the tissues from a vaso-motor
        paralysis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Epithelioma is scarcely more than that, and so we have in this remedy
        features like epithelioma and other cancerous affections. What is the scirrhus but a
        peculiar form of induration?</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When the economy takes on a low type of life, a low form of tissue
        making, and the tissues inflame and upon the slightest provocation indurate we can see that
        this is a kind of constitution that is predisposed to deep-seated troubles, to phthisis, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bright’s</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We are on the border line of ultimates and something Is going to happen.
        This remedy leads the economy into such a state of disorder, a low type of tissue making is
        found, and many of these indurations will have cancer as an ultimate. This is a long acting
        antipsoric remedy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Glands</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There is also
        in this medicine a tendency to induration of the neck of the uterus and the mammary glands.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Glands become slowly inflamed, and do not stop with ordinary congestion
        and hardness, but become as hard as bullets.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This induration extends to the various glands of the body, but is
        especially noticeable in the tonsils.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">For those who have a tendency to colds which settle in the throat,
        especially singling out the tonsils and indurating these; those who keep on taking cold and
        the tonsils keep on growing, and indurating, we have in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> a medicine that
        fits the whole process, the hardening and infiltration, and it cures these cases according
        to the law of similars, when the symptoms agree.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It cures young children growing up with enormously enlarged and very hard
        tonsils in whom every cold settles in the throat.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is one of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., which has the same tendency. In one patient there will be one kind of
        constitution, and, after thoroughly examining it, looks like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You may have a different constitution in another patient, and, after
        carefully examining it, see that it looks like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">; another you will
        see is </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sulphur</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">; another, if you look into it carefully, you find is </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Calcarea carb.,</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and another, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Calcarea
        iod.,</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and so on among those remedies
        capable of bringing about the conditions described.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If we can find symptoms which picture the constitutional state we have no
        trouble. When the symptoms have been well gathered the case is as good as cured; it is easy
        then to find a remedy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Partially proved</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This
        remedy is imperfect from the fact that it is only partially proved. I do not care to dwell
        upon partially proved remedies, but when they have a number of striking features that fit
        into everyday life it is important to know them. The mental symptoms of this remedy are very
        few.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The remedy should be proved in the higher potencies upon sensitive
        persons in order that the mental state may be brought out.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Head</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Some of the
        symptoms of the head are very striking and valuable. Pain on the top of the head with
        burning. The pain is a sensation as if a weight were pressing down into the skull. You will
        see a woman in bed with her hand on top of the head and she will say:</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Doctor, it burns right there like fire, and it presses as if my
        skull would be crushed in, and the only relief I get from pressing hard upon it an from an
        ice cold cloth pressed upon it."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">She wants the cloth changed and made cold every few minutes. It is a
        queer thing that a pressing pain is made better from pressing upon the part. This is like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cactus</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">pressing pain on
        vertex relieved from pressure.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The rubric of remedies with that symptom is very small, and hence this
        remedy fills a place.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are some strange, rare and peculiar symptoms for which paucity of
        remedies, and we have to work in other channels and along sidetracks in getting the
        constitutional state of the patient.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Alumen cured the pressing pain on the vertex in one patient in whom it
        alternated with the most troublesome chronic, irritable bladder.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">" </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Vertigo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">: lying on his back, with weakness in pit of stomach;
        &gt; opening eyes; &gt; turning on right side."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Heart</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There is
        another feature, however, in this remedy, the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">palpitation</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">brought on from </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">lying on the right side.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It would strike anyone as something very singular, because palpitation is
        generally worse lying on the left side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A heart that is fluttering, enlarged or disordered is generally worse
        while lying on the left, as the heart has less room then, but it is strange, rare and unique
        when these symptoms are worse lying on the right side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When this condition is present in a patient it is necessary to find a
        remedy having just exactly that symptom, and very often it will be seen that the rest of the
        symptoms of the case fit into the remedy that has produced this peculiar state.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is one more feature that you must add to these things, viz.: </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">slowness and sluggishness of the muscles</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">throughout the body, a slowing down of all the muscles, a sense of weakness
        in the arms and legs.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Stools and rectum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In
        the <i>constipation </i>there may be some urging to stool without result or he may go
        several days without desire. There is no ability to expel the stool. He will strain a long
        time with no success, and finally after many days the stool is passed and is an
        agglomeration of hard balls, large masses of little bard balls like marbles all fastened
        together.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This is a very strong feature in an </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> constitution.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        or in small pieces like sheep's dung; no relief afterwards."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After stool there is a sensation as if the rectum were yet full. This
        peculiar feature comes with the weakness or paresis of the rectum, i. <i>e., </i>the rectum
        is not strong enough to expel all of its contents, and hence the sensation of unfinished
        stool.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the rectum there is ulceration with bleeding from the ulcers. The
        hemorrhoids ulcerate and they are very painful, so that after every stool he has prolonged
        suffering, a dull aching pain in the rectum.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Catarrhal conditions<i> </i>prevail throughout the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In old scrofulous, psoric patients, who are subject to chronic yellow
        bland discharges from the eyes, with enlarged veins; chronic yellow discharges from the
        vagina and from the urethra in the male; chronic painless gonorrhoea.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In addition to the catarrhal discharges there is a tendency to
        ulceration, so that there are little ulcerative patches in the vagina, little aphthous
        patches in the vagina and on the cervix of the uterus.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When a patient is suffering from a chronic gonorrhoea, instead of the
        discharge becoming white as in a gleet if remains yellow, and there are little indurations
        along the urethra, which the patient will call the physician’s attention to as
        "lumps".</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Discharge with "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">little
        bunches</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" along the urethra. These
        are little ulcers, and beneath the ulcers are indurations.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When this state is present you have an </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> gonorrhoea. In a
        little while the patient will have two or three strictures unless he gets this remedy,
        because these little ulcers will each end in stricture narrowing the canal. Another strange
        feature in the catarrhal states and in the ulcers is its tendency to affect the vessels.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The veins become varicose and bleed, so that there may be bleeding from
        any of the inflamed or catarrhal areas and bleeding from the ulcers.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There are many neuralgic pains about the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">head</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">of a non descript character.
