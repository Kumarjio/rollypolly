        This remedy comes in very nicely after </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">which has much </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in its nature and depends largely upon </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, which is its base, for its way of working.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It occurs to me to throw out a little hint. When you have a good
        substantial proving of an oxide or a carbonate, and the mental symptoms are well brought
        out, you can use these, in a measure in a presumptive way, in prescribing another salt, with
        the same base, which has a few mental symptoms in its proving.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">For instance, you have a group of symptoms decidedly relating to </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        mental symptoms of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and the physical symptoms of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">you can rationally

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: We know the
        mental symptoms of Alumina fairly well.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It especially takes hold of the intellect and so confuses the
        intelligence that the patient is unable to effect a decision; the judgment is disturbed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is unable to realize; the things that he knows or has known to be real
        seem to him to be unreal, and he is in doubt as to whether they are so or not.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Guiding
        Symptoms</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">this is not so plainly expressed, but in the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chronic Diseases</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">we have a record of
        this which is the best expression of it that occurs anywhere.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There we read:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"When he says anything he feels as if another person had said it,
        and when he sees anything, as if another person had seen it, or as if he could transfer
        himself into another and only then could see."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is to say, there is a confusion of mind, a confusion of ideas and
        thoughts. It has cured these symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The consciousness of his personal identity is confused. He is not exactly
        certain who he was; it seemed as though he were not himself.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is in a dazed condition of mind. He makes mistakes in writing and
        speaking! uses words not intended; uses wrong words.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Confusion and obscuration of e intellect. Inability to follow up a train
        of thought. Then he enters into another state, in which he gets into a hurry. Nothing moves
        fast enough; time seems so slow; everything is delayed; nothing goes right.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Besides this he has impulses. When he sees sharp instruments or blood,
        impulses rise up within him and he shudders because of these impulses. An instrument that
        could be used for murder or for killing causes these impulses to arise; impulse to kill
        herself.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient is very sad, constantly sad. Incessantly
        moaning; groaning, worrying, fretting and in a hurry.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Wants to get away; wants to get away from this place, hoping that things
        will be better; full of fears.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All sorts of imaginations. A sort of general apprehensiveness. When he
        meditates upon this state of mind he thinks he is going to lose his reason.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He thinks about this frenzy and hurry and confusion of mind, how he
        hardly knows his own name, and how fretful he is, and he wonders if he is not going crazy,
        and finally he really thinks he is going crazy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Most of the mental symptoms come on in the morning on waking. Sadness and
        weeping on waking in the morning. His moods alternate.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes his mental state is a little improved and his mood changes into
        a quiet placid state, and again he goes into fear and apprehensiveness. Some evil is going
        to take place and he is full of anxiety. Anxiety about the future.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Nerves and weakness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        The next most striking feature is the way in which the remedy acts upon the nerves that
        proceed from the spine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a state of weakness of the muscles supplied by these nerves;
        weakness over the whole body. There is difficulty in swallowing, a paralytic condition of
        the oesophagus; difficulty in raising or moving the arms; paralysis of one side of the body,
        or paralysis of the muscles of the lower extremities, or of the bladder and rectum.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The paralytic state begins as a sort of a semi - paralysis, for a long
        time merely an inactivity, which grows at length into a complete paralytic condition.
        Everything is slowed down.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The conductivity of the nerves is impaired so that a prick of a pin upon
        the extremities is not felt until a second or so afterwards. All of his senses are impaired
        in this way until it really means a benumbing of the consciousness and appears to be a kind
        of stupefaction of his intellect, a mental sluggishness. Impressions reach his mind with a
        marked degree of slowness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The paralytic state runs through the remedy and is observed in various
        parts in many ways. The bladder manifests it in the slowness with which the urine passes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A woman sits a long time before the flow starts, with inability to press,
        and then the stream flows slowly. The patient will say she cannot burry the flow of urine.
        The urine is slow to start and slow to flow, and sometimes only dribbles. At times it is
        retained and dribbles involuntarily.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This slowness is observed also in the rectum. Its tone is lost and there
        is inability to perform the ordinary straining when sitting at stool, and so paretic is the
        rectum that it may be full and distended, and the quantity of faeces enormous, and yet,
        though the stool is soft, there is constipation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In this remedy there is often a hard stool, but we notice that the remedy
        will do the best work where there is this paretic condition of the rectum with soft stool.
        If the mental symptoms however, are present, such as I have described, with large, hard and
        knotty or lumpy stool, Alumina will cure.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, so great is the straining to pass a soft stool that you will
        sometimes hear a patient describe the state as follows:</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When sitting upon the seat she must wait a long time, though there is
        fullness and she has gone many days without stool; she has the consciousness that, she
        should pass a stool and is conscious of the fullness in the rectum, yet she will sit a long
        time and finally will undertake to help herself by pressing down violently with the
        abdominal muscles, straining vigorously, yet conscious that very little effort is made by
        the rectum itself.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She will continue to strain, covered with copious sweat, hanging on to
        the seat, if there be any place to hang on to, and will pull and work as if in labor, and at
        last is able to expel a soft stool, yet with the sensation that more stool remains.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course a number of other remedies have this straining to pass a soft
        stool, but they have their own characteristics. Take for example an individual who cannot
        keep awake; she says that it is impossible for her to read a line without going to sleep;
        that she can sleep all the time; she suffers night and day from a dry mouth, and the tongue
        cleave to the roof of the mouth.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now let her describe this state of straining and struggling to expel a
        soft stool, and you hardly need to go any further before you know the remedy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If that patient in addition to what she has said tells you that she is in
        the habit of fainting when standing any length of time, that she is disturbed in a close
        room and has all sorts of complaints in the cold air, it is </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Nux moschata.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Now you see how easy it is for remedies to talk; they tell their own
        story. Suppose a woman should come to you who has been suffering from haemorrhage, from
        prolonged oozing, who is pallid and weak and is distended with flatulence, with much
        belching and passing of gas, and the more she passes the worse she feels, and she has these
        same symptoms of straining a long time to pass a soft stool, tremendous effort with
        inactivity of the rectum. You could do nothing but give her </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now you know how easy it is for remedies to talk and tell their own
        story.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">By allowing remedies to talk and tell their own story, individualization
        is accomplished.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I have said all that to show that it <i>is </i>not upon the inactivity of
        the rectum that you are to decide upon the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Individualization must be made through the patient. That is a principle
        that should never be violated. You may have twenty remedies all possessing a certain symptom
        but if you have a few real decided things that you can say about the patient, the manner in
        which he does business, the manner in which the disease affects the entire man, then you
        have something to individualize by.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You have seen the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient, the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient and the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Nux</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">moschata</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient. The sole duty of the physician is to treat the sick,
        which means to study the patient himself until an idea of the sickness is obtained.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Vertigo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This medicine
        is full of vertigo; he quivers, reels and "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">objects go round</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">"
        almost constantly. It corresponds to the vertigo of tired-out people, old broken down
        patients, men worn out from old age.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Vertigo also that comes on when closing the eyes, as is found in spinal
        affections, in sclerosis of posterior lateral columns.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has produced
        affections analogous to locomotor ataxia. It produces numbness of the soles of the feet, the
        fulgurating pains, the vertigo when closing the eyes, and produces staggering and
        disturbances of coordination.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is true that in an early stage of locomotor ataxia </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will check the disease process by bringing into order the internal state of
        the economy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aluminum
        metallicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> I have, stopped fulgurating
        pains in old incurable cases, and improved the reflexes wonderfully, thus showing the
        general improvement of the patient.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Modalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Most of
        the symptoms are &lt; on rising in the morning.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the morning as I have mentioned it, the urine is slower to pass than
        after, he has moved about and warmed up a little. His limbs are stiffer in the morning and
        in the morning he has to whip up his mental state. He wakes up confused and wonders where he
        is.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will see that in children especially-they wake up in the morning in a
        bewildered state, such as you will find in Alumina, Aesculus, Lycopod<i>.</i></p><i>
        </i>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He has to put his mind on things to ascertain whether they be so or not,
        as to how things should look and wonders whether he is at home or in some other place.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are many headaches with nausea and vomiting. The headaches come
        whenever he takes cold. This probably is due to the catarrhal state.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mucous membranes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient suffers almost constantly from dryness of mucous membranes, the
        nose is dry, stuffed up, especially in one side, commonly the left.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Nose feels full of sticks, dry membranes or crusts, old atrophic catarrh
        crusts in the posterior nares and in the fossa of Rosenmuller.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Large green, offensive crusts all through the nose. Now comes the
        relation to the headache. Every time he catches cold the thick yellow discharge slacks up
        and gives way to a watery discharge and be has pain in the forehead over the eyes, going
        through the head, with nausea and vomiting.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So when it says headache from chronic catarrh that is what it means. The
        headache &gt; lying down. He has sick headaches and periodical headaches.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will see that Alumina corresponds to a constitution that may be
        called psoric-old, broken-down, feeble constitutions, scrofulous constitutions, such as are
        inclined to tubercles and catarrhal affections.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The catarrhal tendency of this remedy is marked. Catarrhs are found
        wherever mucous membranes exist. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> affects the skin and mucous membrane extensively, i.
        e., the external and internal skin, the surfaces of the body.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is always expectorating, he blows the nose much and has
        discharges from the eyes. There is much disturbance of vision belonging to this catarrhal
        state that may be spoken of now.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Dimness of vision, as if looking through a fog sometimes described as
        through a veil. A misty dimness of vision.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is also disturbance of the muscles of the eye, of the muscles of
        the ball and of the ciliary muscle. Weak and changeable vision. The paralytic weakness, such
        as belongs to the whole remedy, will be found in certain muscles, or sets of muscles, so
        that it is with great difficulty that glasses can be adjusted. The activity of the eye
        muscles is disturbed.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Naso pharynx</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        catarrhal state extends over into the back of the nose and the posterior nares are filled up
        with tough mucus and crusts, and on looking into the throat you will see that the soft
        palate and the mucous membrane of the tonsils and pharynx and all parts that can be seen are
        in a state of granulation, are swollen, congested and inflamed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pharynx feels dry and there is a chronic sensitiveness and soreness.
        When swallowing food there is stinging and sensation as if the throat were full of little
        sticks, especially after a moment's rest, better by moistening and swallowing. In the night
        air, after keeping still a while, there in an accumulation of ropy mucus.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This extends into the larynx with soreness in the larynx and chest and
        chronic dry, backing cough. The same catarrhal state proceeds down into the oesophagus, so
        that it becomes sensitive and clumsy. He swallows with difficulty.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bolus goes down with an effort and he feels it all the way down.
        There is soreness and clumsiness, paresis and difficulty of swallowing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This paralytic weakness reminds the patient that he must put on a little
        force in order to swallow and this swallowing is felt while the substance goes down as if
        the oesophagus was sensitive. It has a catarrhal state of the stomach, bowels and rectum so
        that with the soft and difficult stool there is often an accumulation of mucus.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is also a catarrhal condition in the bladder, kidneys and urethra
        and an old gonorrhoea will be prolonged into a catarrhal or gleety discharge.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes it is not a gleet, but the discharge remains for many months
        and instead of its being a light milky white, such as is natural in most prolonged cases of
        gonorrhoea, it remains yellow and is painless. So it is with the vagina.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mucous discharge from the vagina is thick yellowish-white discharge,
        sometimes excoriating. Thus we see, in the constitution we have described, that an extensive
        catarrhal state belongs to the remedy.</p>

        the skin we find that it takes on a similar state of affairs. The patient is subject to all
        sorts of eruptions. The skin withers, becomes dry and is subject to eruptions, thickening,
        indurations, ulcerations, cracking and bleeding.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The eruptions itch worse in the warmth of the bed. The skin itches, even
        when there is no eruption, when becoming warm in bed, so that he scratches until the skin
        bleeds. This presents an idea as to eruptions that you will have to consider. A patient
        comes to you covered with crusts, and he says:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course after this there is an apparent eruption because crusts form.
        As soon as the healing begins the itching begins, and he is only relieved when the skin is
        raw. With the bleeding moisture of the skin there is relief of the itching.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now some of the books do not make the distinction between itching without
        eruption and itching with eruption, and hence mostly all young, doctors get to thinking that
        itching of the skin must always be associated with eruption, and make a mistake in figuring
        out what kind of an eruption it is.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The skin thickens and indurates and ulcerates, and there are indurations
        under the ulcers. There is a very sluggish condition of both mucous membrane and skin with a
        tendency to induration.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Thickening of the mucous membrane will be found anywhere; after the
        thickening come little ulcerations, and in the course of time indurations are formed at the
        base of the ulcers. The same thing is true of the skin. Dryness and burning through
        everything and may be said of all the mucous membranes and the skin in general.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chronic granular lids. It we turn the eyelids down we will see that the
        mucous membrane is thickened. Sometimes this thickening or hypertrophy causes a turning out
        of the lids like ectropion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"The eyelashes fall out;" that is in keeping with the general
        state.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The hairs all over the body fall out. Parts become entirely denuded of
        hair; the hair of the scalp falls out extensively. All sorts of sounds in the ears, buzzing,

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The discharge is a painless one in the male. The gonorrhoeal discharge

        That is not strange; it is only in keeping with the general state, the broken down

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">On beginning to sing the voice is weak and husky, but after using it a

        the throat until the voice can get to work.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The vocal cords on beginning to work are covered with mucus and on

        The vocal cords are painful after motion and the larynx is painful to touch.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Some times this is so marked that it is like stabbing with a knife on
        trying to use the voice. So we must individualize hoarseness very extensively.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Homoeopathy is a matter of discrimination. Soreness of the chest which is
        much increased by talking. There is weakness of the muscular power of the chest. The lungs
        seem weak and the chest has a sensation of weakness in it. Jar increases the misery of the

        <p align="JUSTIFY">In myelitis this medicine does wonderful work when there is a
        considerable amount of spasmodic condition of the back as well, showing that the membranes
        are involved.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another thing that belongs to this remedy that is a well known state in
        myelitis is the hoop sensation; sensation of bandages here and there about the limbs and
        body is a common symptom.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A sensation of a tight cord around the body characteristic of the most

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Running through the remedy very often, there is a great lack of animal
        heat, coldness, and yet the patient wants to be in the open air; must be well clothed open
        and kept warm, but wants to be in the open air.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient takes cold continually from every change and draft. Sometimes
        the patient will go to bed as cold as a frog, and when warm in bed is so disturbed by
        itching and the warmth of the bed that there is no comfort.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These are two extremes coming together. The circulation is so feeble over

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The febrile condition of this remedy is not at all marked. There is not
        much chill and not much fever, but the passive, slow, sluggish, chronic elements and chronic
        symptoms are the ones that prevail most markedly. In weak, broken-down cases there are some
        night sweats and sweating towards morning. Slight chill in morning. Chill with thirst.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A striking feature of the remedy is the chronic dryness of the skin.
