        looking over this remedy as a whole it will appear to you that you have been studying the
        characteristics of one </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">prematurely</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">old.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will often see symptoms coming on in one at fifty years of age that
        should appear at eighty, and after studying this remedy you will see that the same aspect is
        presented, a premature old age.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We recognize trembling and a peculiar kind of feebleness that cannot be
        described by any expression but senility; it is not the confusion of mind belonging to
        sickness, but the peculiar state we recognize in old people, in declining life; trembling
        and tottering and a dreamy state of mind with forgetfulness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He goes on from one subject to another, asking a question, and, without
        waiting for it to be answered, asking another.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">And so he jumps about from one topic to another. It can hardly be said to
        be confusion, it is a dreamy state of mind, a state of senility.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This remedy is useful when such a state is found in young persons, when
        the mind is not insane and yet it is weak. Especially is it indicated in those persons who
        manifest a momentary, fleeting inquisitiveness, </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">jumping from one subject to another.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Often a patient asks me one question after another, never waiting to have
        the first one answered, a flitting, flighty talker, who does not seem to realize that I have
        not answered his questions; that patient, I say to myself, needs Ambra grisea.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That state of mind belongs to modern society women in such great
        frequency that you will be astonished to note it on all hands.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A modern society belle that could not darn the heel of her stocking to
        save her soul will in a few years get into just that state, and even </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ambra</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will not cure her.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But there is a kind of nervous sickness manifested by these symptoms that
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ambra grisea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will cure. Alternation of depression of spirits with vehemence of
        temper is an other feature. That naturally belongs to old age.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A period of greatest excitability is often followed by depression, a
        state of indifference to all things, to joy, to grief, to people etc., treating with
        indifference things that would naturally break the heart of a well-balanced person.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He does not even wonder why he is not excited over these wonderful
        things, so decided is the state of indifference. Many of the complaints are </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">worse in the morning.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He gets up with confusion and dullness of mind and is in a dreamy state
        and towards evening he takes on symptoms of insanity.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Vertigo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ambra</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is one of the most frequently indicated medicines in simple, nondescript </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">vertigo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">of old men.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So dizzy that they cannot go out on the street; so dizzy upon getting up
        in the morning that they must wait a while until they can get a-round on their feet. It is
        the dizziness belonging to senility and to premature old age.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Now, when this
        man undertakes to meditate upon something his ideas are whisked away. It is a sort of
        confusion with </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">vanishing of ideas.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He has to make an unusual effort a few times to bring his thoughts back
        to the place before he can concentrate the mind to meditate upon some idea.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But while concentration of the mind is difficult, he is compelled to sit
        and </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">dwell upon the most disagreeable
        things</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">that force themselves upon him and he cannot get rid of them.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is somewhat analogous <i>to </i></font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Natrum mur.,</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">but the peculiar feature of the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Natr. mur. is</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">that she delights to
        dwell upon past unpleasant occurrences and lies awake at night thinking about them.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ambra grisea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is forced
        to dwell upon such things. Images, false faces, hideous imaginations, fancies and visions
        annoy him and keep him awake.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the semi-dreamy state he is kept holding up before his mind these
        grimaces. Such a state of mind may come on from business embarrassments with vertigo,
        congestion to the head and brain fag.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">One thing running through this remedy is that the <i>presence of other
        persons aggravates the symptoms; </i>also the <i>marked aggravation from conversation.</i></p><i>
        </i>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A woman, when attended by a nurse, is unable to have a stool without
        sending the nurse into another room. In spite of much straining she can do nothing unless
        alone.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is said in <i>Natr. mur. </i>that the patient cannot urinate in the
        presence of other persons.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The urine will not start when anyone is around. That is a port of general
        feature of this remedy. Confusion of mind and embarrassment in the presence of other
        persons. Embarrassment in company. As soon as he goes into company there is flushing,
        trembling, nervous excitement and the thoughts vanish.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With these symptoms the patient imagines that he is going out of his
        mind, and finally he settles down into a state of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">melancholy</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">sadness and despair, and does not want to live. He
        loathes his life and wants to die.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Great sadness."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Melancholy, sits for days weeping."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Such is the mental state of this prematurely old patient with broken down
        constitution. It is a picture of a wreck and the question will arise when you find a patient
        that looks and acts in this way whether you have received him in time to cure him.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You readily see you have before you one who is going down hill and going
        into insanity of one form or another. A physician sees the forerunner of a great breakdown
        when he sees an </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ambra grisea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient with the nervous mental state, the quivering,
        trembling and excitement in one who was once a strong, vigorous man.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Some great business or domestic shock has come upon this patient. It is
        not the aspect you see when phthisis is coming on; you do not we the cachectic condition,
        but it is a prostration of the nervous system, a mental prostration.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A man goes through the trial of one death after another in the family and
        there seems to be nothing remaining; he cannot look at it philosophically; he has lost his
        business and his friends and then he takes on dreaminess and wonders whether life is
        worthing living.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Then it is you get the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ambra

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Modalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">: Many of
        the complaints come on in the <i>morning </i>and many come on <i>after eating</i></font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is not mentioned in the text, but it is also worse after eating.</p>

        tremble, aggravates his mental symptoms and gives him pain in the back as from a hammer.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A number of physical symptoms are brought out by listening to music. The
        tones seem as if they were a material substance taking hold of him.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Complaints are often <i>one-sided; </i>perspiration on one side of the
        body or perspiration on the affected side.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"On right side of head, a spot where hair when touched pains as if

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Scalp feels sore in the morning when awaking; this is followed by a
        sensation of numbness."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The word <i>numbness you will </i>find running through the complaints.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will find a peculiar kind of numbness, such as belongs to old people.

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Again, we find

        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is dimness of vision coming on without any condition in the eye
        that would justify it. It is a nervous dimness of vision, a senile paralysis coming on.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A good deal of this cough is of nervous origin. It is a cough with
        excitement, with nervousness, with trembling, which would make one of considerable
        experience wonder if that patient did not have brain and spinal cord trouble.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Nervous cough, such as occurs often, in spinal irritation. Cough from
        constriction of the larynx followed by copious flow of white mucus.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a paroxysmal cough, much like whooping cough. Asthmatic dyspnoea
        from any little exertion, from music, from excitement. Cough with congestion of blood to the
        head. Cough from thinking and from anxiety.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is not very long after these symptoms show themselves before this
        patient will emaciate and wither. until the skin looks like dried beef. With all he is a
        tremulous and shaky patient.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He complains a great deal of tearing pressure deep in the left side of
        the chest. Sensation of rawness in the chest and itching in the chest. Titillation and
        itching, moving about here and there if he tries to touch the place and scratch it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will not be surprised to know that this patient suffers from
        palpitation of the heart upon slight exertion, from excitement, from music, from any effort
        to put the mind on anything, with trembling and quivering.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">And this palpitation he notices even to the extremities; he throbs all
        over. His extremities pulsate. He is conscious of his arteries everywhere and the
        palpitation of his heart causes oppression of breathing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The limbs easily become numb; pressed upon in the slightest manner they
        go to sleep; go to sleep on being crossed. Coldness, trembling and stiffness of the
        extremities. The finger nails become brittle and are shriveled.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The arms go to sleep when lying down.</p>
