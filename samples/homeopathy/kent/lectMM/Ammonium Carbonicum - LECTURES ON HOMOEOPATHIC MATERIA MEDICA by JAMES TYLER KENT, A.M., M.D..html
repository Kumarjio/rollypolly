        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: If we
        were practicing in the old-fashioned way and considered the wonderfully volatile nature of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ammonium carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. in some of its forms we would only look upon it as an agent to relieve
        fainting and simple affections and use it in the form of hartshorn to comfort old maids and
        some other women.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ammonium carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is a deep-acting, constitutional medicine, an
        anti-psoric. It effects rapid blood changes, it disturbs the whole economy and it
        establishes a scorbutic constitution. Its fluids are all acrid.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The saliva becomes acrid and excoriates the lips, so that they crack in
        the corners and middle, and become raw and dry and scabby.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The eye-lids fester and become dry and cracked from the excoriating
        fluids from the eye.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The stool is acrid and excoriates.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The genitals of the female become raw and sore from the acrid menstrual
        discharge and leucorrhoea, and wherever there is an ulcer upon the skin the fluids that ooze
        from it excoriate the parts round about, this excoriating character belonging to all of the
        exuding fluids and discharges.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy has bleeding of black blood, often fluid blood, that will not
        coagulate, flowing from the nose, the uterus, the bladder and bowels.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The blood is dark, showing that a great disturbance is taking place in
        the circulation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The skin has a mottled appearance intermingled with great pallor.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It produces a violent action upon the heart, in which there is audible
        palpitation, and every motion aggravates the pulsation. With this is associated great
        prostration.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is rather a strange coincidence that the ancients know that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Amm. carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. would overcome difficult breathing from cardiac<i> </i>attacks and that
        aqua ammonia or hartshorn is used today to a certain extent in indications similar to those
        mentioned.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They use it as a stimulant, but when indicated the single dose very high
        is enough.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The ancients knew enough, also, to use hartshorn in the low forms of
        pneumonia, at the turning point in the advanced stage; that is an old allopathic practice,
        but it had a homoeopathic relation to some of the cases.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Once in a while they would cure a patient in the awful stage of
        prostration with heart failure at the end of pneumonia, and because they relieved such a one
        it was then established as a remedy for all future use.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ammonium carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has a
        state analogous to blood poisoning, such as we find in erysipelas and in the most malignant
        forms of scarlet fever, with prostration, great dyspnoea, so that it seems as if the heart
        were giving out.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With this there is an unusual patchy condition of the surface, due to the
        paralytic condition of the blood vessels, enlargement of the glands, duskiness and puffiness
        of the face.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Amm. carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has been
        used allopathically in just such a state for centuries and it has demonstrated its
        homeopathic relations by its efficacy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Heart</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It belongs to
        the simple enfeeblement, weak heart, emaciation. There is quite an absence of symptoms and a
        lack of response to remedies.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient must lie in bed because of the palpitation and difficult
        breathing on motion. It is a matter of mere weakness. Such a case furnished me much
        amusement for a year and a half.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There was a woman in this city who answered just such a description; her
        state was one of peculiar cardiac weakness with dyspnoea and palpitation on motion; I had
        been treating the case, but had not fully studied it, and as she did not progress under my
        management she was taken out of my hands and taken to one of our most able neurologists, who
        put her upon the "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">rest cure</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" and promised that in six weeks she would be
        perfectly well.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But at the end of six weeks she was worse than ever and a cardiac
        specialist was then brought to examine her.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He said it was true the heart was not vigorous, but there was no organic
        affection and consequently the case did not belong to his branch.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Then a lung specialist was brought in, and later she was examined by all
        kinds of specialists. All of her organs were fully investigated, and it was announced that
        nothing was the matter with them; but the poor woman could not walk because of her
        sufferings and palpitating heart.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She had a little dry, backing cough that did not amount to anything, but
        her chest was examined and there was nothing wrong with it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But after she bad been in this continual fire for about three months, and
        was steadily failing, the side of the family that were my adherents prevailed against the
        others and I went to see her again.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">I continued to study the case, which was extremely vague, having nothing
        but those few symptoms, and finally I settled upon </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ammonium carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., and she
        has been on this remedy for eighteen months.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She now climbs mountains, she does everything she wants to do and is
        about ready to go to housekeeping.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She has grown from a case of nervous prostration, brain fag and any other
        diagnosis that might have been heaped upon her to a well woman, and under that one remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This shows you how deeply this remedy acts. One dose generally acts upon
        her for from six weeks to two months, steadily improving her each time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Exhaustion coming at every menstrual period. An attack of cholera, or
        what one might mistake for cholera, coming the first day of the menses; a copious diarrhea.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes it is an exhaustion with vomiting, exhaustion as in Veratrum,
        with coldness, blueness, sinking, dyspnoea.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Asthma</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The kind of
        dyspnoea that I have been speaking of up to this time is not an asthmatic dyspnoea; it is a
        cardiac dyspnoea due to a weak heart; but this remedy has also asthma, and in the asthma
        there is this peculiarity: if the room is warm the dyspnoea increases until suffocation
        seems imminent; as if he would die for want of breath.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is compelled to go out into the cold air for relief. While the warm
        room increases the dyspnoea in asthmatic complaints the bodily state of the patient is worse
        from cold.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The complaints of the body and the headaches are worse from cold.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bones</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: A common thing
        running through this remedy is aching in the bones. The bones ache as if they would break.
        The teeth ache violently from every change of weather or from change of the temperature in
        the mouth. The jaws ache or the roots of the teeth ache.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A prominent feature is falling out of the hair, the finger nails become
        yellowish, the gums settle away from the teeth and bleed, the teeth become loose, all in
        keeping with the scorbutic constitution.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Hysteria</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This remedy
        has hysteria, and it is not surprising that nervous women carry a bottle of ammonia hanging
        to their chain.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many women do this because as soon as they go into a close place they
        faint and must use their hartshorn.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This condition in the woman, if in a mild degree, is not hysterical; it
        belongs to the sensitive nature of women; but if carried to a more marked state. It is
        hysterical.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The hysterical fainting will be averted by the use of the hartshorn. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Amm. carb.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will stimulate the action of the heart and relieve.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Depression</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The remedy
        is full of depression of spirits. She weeps much, has fainting fits, anxiety, uneasiness and
        exhaustion from motion. Over sensitive about what she hears other people saying.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Complaints from listening to others talking. Complaints, both mental and
        physical, are worse in the wet weather, and she is sensitive to cold, raw, wet weather.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The gouty complaints. nervous complaints, prostration, cardiac
        complaints, dyspnoea, headaches, etc., come on in raw weather.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Headache</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: A congestive
        headache comes on in wet weather and from weather changes. Sensation as if the brain would
        ooze out through the forehead and eyes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pulsating, beating in the forehead as if it would burst."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headache is worse from stepping, especially the head aches that come
        at the menstrual period.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Headache worse in the morning. This medicine. in such headaches, with the
        symptoms I have described, shows its antidotal relation to </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">because <i>Lachesis </i>produces all this state of
        prostration.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In the old text-books you will notice this expression, "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Inimical to Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This means when </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">has been given in high potency and has acted curatively, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ammonium carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is not likely to act curatively after it, and is, some times capable of
        disturbing the case, confusing it and mixing up the symptoms.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But when </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lach</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">has been given in too low potency, and the patient has been poisoned with
        the crude Medicine, this remedy then becomes an antidote, used in a high potency, because of
        the similarity in its action.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It will, overcome many of the poisonous symp toms of the case. If you
        will examine the appearance of people who have been bitten by snakes and then examine the
        pathogenesis of this remedy you will see a great similarity between them.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is well known that this remedy has had repeated use in snake bites.
        Evidently it did not save all of them, but it must have done something, for these cases or
        it would not have established so great a reputation for itself.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Give it not as an antidote <i>per se, </i>but when indicated in
        blood-poisoning and animal bites with zymosis, with a tendency to black liquid bleeding, as
        in Elaps.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Running through the snake poisons there is a tendency to bleeding of
        black blood that will not coagulate.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It has many eye
        symptoms.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sparks before the eyes in connection with headaches; double vision;
        aversion to light.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Large black spot floats before the eyes after sewing."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When these symptoms have been present in such a constitutional state as I
        have, described the remedy has cured cataract; it has, cured the patient and finally the
        crystalline lens has cleared up.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Burning of the eyes, smarting eyes blood-shot eyes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It disturbs the hearing, causing hardness of hearing and discharge of
        acrid fluid from the ears.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Nose</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: We have had
        scorbutic, catarrhal condition of the nose, such as described.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Discharge from the nose acrid.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Severe pain as if the brain were forcing itself out just above
        nose."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Nose-bleed when washing face or hands in morning."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has many complaints from bathing, and a prominent feature is that the
        skin is covered with red, mottled spots after bathing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Bathing produces surging all over, here and there, as well as nose-bleed.
        Palpitation is worse from bathing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the throat we have an appearance like malignant scarlet fever,
        diphtheria and other zymotic state; purple, swollen, ulcerated and bleeding, and gangrenous,
        accompanied by great exhaustion, with enlarged tonsils and glands.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The glands outside of the throat and neck are enlarged and felt as lumps.
        In diphtheria, when the nose is stopped, the child starts from sleep gasping for breath.
        Here again we observe its relation to </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and the ophidia, for soon after the patient drops to sleep he wakes up
        suffocating, in diphtheria, in chest troubles with great prostration, the patient is worse
        after sleep.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Menses</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Menses too
        soon.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"The menstrual blood is blackish, often in clots."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The leucorrhoea is acrid,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Violent tearing in abdomen and vagina."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Irritation of clitoris."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Swelling of the genitals. Now, let me tell you something not mentioned
        here, but important, and that is a sensation of soreness in the whole pelvic viscera; at
        times it seems as if all her inner parts were raw.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a sensation of soreness; not always sore to touch. This sensation
        of deep-seated soreness is especially felt during menstruation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All through the menstrual period soreness and rawness.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Menses premature, abundant, blackish, often in clots, preceded by

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Chest</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The remedy is
        full of catarrhal symptoms and cough, with much rattling of mucus in the chest and air
        passages.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Oppression of breathing, a catarrhal dyspnoea. Especially is this a
        remedy, when the symptoms agree, in hypostatic congestion of the lungs, a filling up of the
        chest with mucus which it is difficult to expel; great rattling in the chest and great
        weakness.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is a good palliative in the last stages of consumption.
