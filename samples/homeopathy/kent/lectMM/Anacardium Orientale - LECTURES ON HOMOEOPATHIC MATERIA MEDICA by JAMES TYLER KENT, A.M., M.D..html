        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind appears to be feeble; almost, if not complete imbecility; seems
        as if in a dream; everything is strange; slow to comprehend. Marked irritability; disturbed
        by everything; cursing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Weak memory. Forgetful of things in his mind but a moment ago. All his
        senses seem to vanish and he gropes around as if in a dream.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Change of states; after states. Dullness and sluggishness of the mind
        prevail. He is in a continuous controversy with himself. Irresolution marks his character.
        He cannot settle between doing this and that, he hesitates and often does nothing. He cannot
        decide, especially in an action of good or evil.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He hears voices commanding him to do this or that, and seems to be
        between a good and an evil will. He is persuaded by his evil will to do acts of violence and
        injustice, but is withheld and restrained by a good will. So there is a controversy between
        two wills, between two impulses. When this is really analyzed by one who knows something of
        the nature of man it will be seen that the man is disturbed in his external will, but the
        internal will cannot be affected by medicine.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">His external voluntary is continuously excited by external influences,
        but his real will, in which is his conscience, restrains that and keeps him from carrying
        the impulses into effect. This can only be observed when its action is on a really good man.
        He has a controversy when his external will is aroused, but in an evil man there is no
        restraint and be will not have this symptom</font><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000ff">

        demon sits on one shoulder and an angel on the other.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is disposed to malice and has an irresistible desire to curse and
        swear. Laughs when he should be serious. So it is carried on until all things in the
        external will are inverted. Internal anxiety, i. e., the internal will is in a turmoil. over

        on a portion of the mind that it teaches a great deal.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">I have learned much from </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Anac., Aurum and Argentum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        of the strange action of medicines on the human mind.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Psychology must be figured out by the action of drugs on the human mind.
        By this means we get at facts and can lay aside many hypotheses.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Ideas as if nothing were real, all seems to be a dream. Fixed ideas. He
        thinks he is double. This comes from a vague consciousness that there is a difference
        between the external and internal will, a consciousness that one will is the body and
        another is the mind.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Dwells on thoughts about salvation. That a stranger is by his side, is
        another recognition of the two wills. That strange forms accompany him, one to his right
        side and one to his left. This mental state drives him to madness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Alternation of his moods and understanding. One moment he sees a thing
        and another moment he does not understand it. One moment she sees it is her child and
        another that it is not. One moment it is a delusion and next moment it is an illusion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">One moment thinks it is so and next moment has enough reason left that it
        is not so .</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Delusion is an advanced stage of illusion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the Repertory we have the same remedies often in illusion and
        delusion, it is a matter of grade.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When the intellect is slightly affected it is an illusion, and what he
        sees he knows is not so.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He sees demons, and at first he knows from his intelligence that a demon
        is not there, but later, he wants you to drive him out.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It does not matter which, they are similar symptoms, and it is a matter
        of degree, and so, in the Repertory, delusions and illusions are not given separate places.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Anac., Hyos., Stram, and Bell</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., are important in bringing out the quality of the perverted human mind as
        to the intelligence and affections.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Whenever a medicine makes a man desire to do something it affects his
        will, and when it affects his intelligence it is acting on his understanding. Medicines act
        on both.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Low-spirited, disheartened, fears be is pursued, looks for thieves,
        expects enemies, fears everything and everybody.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Full of internal anxiety. No peace. He is separated from the whole world,
        and he despairs to do that which is required of him. Cowardly in the extreme.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Fears some dreadful thing will happen. Morose, sulky, sullen.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Unsocial; complains of weak memory. Slight causes make him excessively
        angry. A strong feature is that all moral feeling is taken out of him. He feels cruel. Can
        do bodily injury without feeling.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cruel, malicious, wicked.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Bad effects of mental excitement. Weak-minded. Consequences of fright and
        mortification. Suitable in religious mania when the conflict between the external and
        internal will is kept up. It is analogous to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hyos</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many complaints are ameliorated by eating.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensation here and there of pressure, described as if a plug, all through
        the body, in the head, eyes, in the navel and down the spine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Objects appear too far off. Things have a strange look, sometimes
        uncanny. Illusions of smell, burning timber, pigeon's dung.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chronic dry coryza.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The whole body has been well covered by symptoms; but it seems that the
        mind represents the principal aspect, and A will seldom be used excepting for such mind
        symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Usually when the mental symptoms are strong the physical are also covered
        by the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Full of trembling and paralytic weakness. Tetanus; epilepsy. Sensations
        as of a hoop or band around the body, limbs or head; pressing as of a plug.</p>
