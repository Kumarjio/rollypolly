        <b><font face="Arial" size="5" color="#000080">
        <p align="CENTER"><a name="Antimonium_crudum">Antimonium Crudum</a></p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: You will
        be surprised, when studying full provings of this substance, to notice that all the symptoms
        seem to centre about the stomach; it does not matter much what kind of complaints he suffers
        from the stomach takes part in it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains disturb his stomach and bring, on nausea; with his headache he
        is sick at the stomach; with all complaints his stomach is out of order, and, on the other
        band, whenever he disorders his stomach he is sick all over. Complaints that manifest
        themselves through the stomach very frequently need this medicine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">First in importance are the mental symptoms showing the type of
        constitution likely to need this remedy. It produces a very serious state in the mind, an
        absence of the desire to live. It is well known to physicians that the case is a serious one
        if the patient has no desire to live; life is a burden. When I hear a patient say:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Oh, doctor, if I could only die."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I do not like such a case; there is some deep-seated trouble in the
        economy that is hard to remove. Something is threatening, and when it comes it is a common
        thing to see the patient actually die.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Loathing of life."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You will find this especially in a low, lingering, continued fever, such
        as typhoid. This remedy has all the prostration of typhoid, and it has the continued type of
        fever as well as the intermittent and remittent. The prostration is similar to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arsenicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, but </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. have overwhelming fear of death, while this medicine
        has loathing of life; and so they both part company. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, has overwhelming
        restlessness, this remedy is seldom restless. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has an intense
        thirst, this medicine is thirstless.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So even though both these remedies have excessive exhaustion with
        continued fever, we see they have features dissimilar enough to make them wholly distinct.
        Such a typhoid will sometimes be seen in young girls about puberty who are threatening to go
        into chlorosis. They have loathing of life, but it is a hysterical loathing of life.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Moments of great exhaustion, sudden attacks of weakness and fainting. You
        will commonly find another feature with this, not coming at the same moment. but alternating
        with it, or only present at times, namely, these over excitable, intense, nervous,
        hysterical, ecstatic young girls and women are overcome by mellow lights such as flow
        through stained glass windows or the mellow light from the moon in the evening.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is, what is meant when it says in the text:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sentimental mood in the moonlight."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a hysterical state, a disorderly outburst of the affections, such
        affections as can be aroused only in one who is sick, or one who is unbalanced in the
        general nervous system.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This kind of patient gives us the mental state and constitution of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ant. crud.,</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and along with such mental states the physical conditions seems to strike
        to the stomach, as it were.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We have running through this remedy a general state that you should keep
        in mind, that is, a gouty or rheumatic state, in which the symptoms change with the changes
        of the weather; worse in cold, damp weather, worse from cold bathing, better from the heat
        of a hot bath, worse from taking sour wine, and worse from stimulants of any kind.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When you use the expression "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">worse from wine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," it
        is not only important to know that the patient is worse from wine, but also the character of
        complaints that are worse from wine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This patient becomes easily intoxicated, but the physical symptoms are
        more disturbed than the mental; his gouty symptoms are worse from sour wine; all the pains
        and aches of the body are worse from sour wine; headaches come from this cause and the
        gastric disturbances are greatly aggravated from sour wine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This patient is worse at night, worse in damp weather, worse from damp
        cold, better from lying down quietly, better from applied heat, but much worse from
        over-heating and from radiated heat, and in a warm room.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Many of the symptoms come on in the sun's rays and from the heat of an
        open grate. The open fire is wholly against the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ant. crud</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. patient.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A child with whooping cough will cough more after looking into the fire.
        Such things are queer; they are so strange that there is no philosophical hypothesis to
        explain them, no theory that looks toward an explanation, but they are facts which we must
        accept.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Gout</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The whole gouty
        nature of the case seems to change so suddenly that you wonder where the more exterior
        symptoms have gone to, for all at once in a night or a day the patient commences to vomit
        and you have persistent vomiting, lasting days and weeks, until the gouty symptoms come back
        into the extremities.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is wonderful how quickly this old-fashioned metastasis will come on,
        this changing from one place to another. The gout suddenly ceases in the extremities and
        stomach symptoms come on, and you may call it gout in the stomach if you will.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Catarrhal symptoms</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        There are catarrhal symptoms in this remedy; catarrh of the nose, stomach, rectum, etc., and
        an increased flow of mucus from any of these localities from drinking sour wine and from
        taking cold.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A distressing feature of the catarrh is the stuffing up of the nose at
        night. As soon as he gets into an overheated room, his nose gets stuffed lip.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The coryza has a tendency to become chronic, because of the low and
        feeble circulation and the poor constitution.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When it becomes chronic it is worse at night and is associated-with
        headaches. As the catarrh slackens up and becomes dry the headache becomes worse; he has
        neuralgia in the head, crushing pains and dreadful sickness at the stomach with vomiting.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He often has an attack of sick headache and it will be called by the
        family a gastric sick headache, but the condition just mentioned comes on from taking cold,
        which slacks up the thick discharge into a dryness of the nose and the inhaled air burns the
        nose like fire.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes these troubles pass off after an intense vomiting spell;
        sometimes they do not, but the headache may remain for days not relieved by vomiting, or
        relieved only after prolonged vomiting.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Headache</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There are
        remedies full of headache and as soon as ho vomits he feels better, but in this remedy he
        vomits long, and becomes relaxed and exhausted.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headache is worse moving about, worse at night better from lying
        down, from keeping quiet, better in the open air, worse in warm room, worse from
        overheating, worse from radiated heat and light. You see now how the catarrh, the headache
        and gastric symptoms all belong together.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is because the patient is sick that you cannot take symptoms
        separately, you must prescribe for the whole man.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another feature belonging to the mucous membranes, and an
        important one; these membranes have a tendency to throw out a milky white exudation or
        deposit, and it is especially noticed upon the tongue.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mucous membranes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        whole tongue is covered with a milk-white coating. This you find in all diseases where the
        remedy is indicated.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the stomach disorders of children, in gastric fevers, in complaints
        with fever and much vomiting great irritation of the whole nervous system and in irritation
        of the stomach in typhoids, the tongue looks white. Upon the slightest provocation he will
        retch and gag.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Every thing seems to disturb him. He has loathing of food; the thought
        and smell of food disturb him. This is like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arsenicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Voice and larynx</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He takes a cold bath at night on going to bed and gets
        up in the morning voiceless cannot speak a word.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This has come on in an apparently painless manner; he does not know that
        it is present until he attempts to speak in the morning. This may be present with spasms, of
        the larynx clutchings of the throat. Colds sometimes go down into the throat and into the
        trachea, producing a bronchitis or pneumonia.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Cough</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Dry, hacking
        spasmodic cough in diminishing paroxysms.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I will explain that: The first paroxysm occurs with great violence,
        racking his whole frame, and lasting a longer or shorter period, to be followed by one with
        less violence and another with less violence; perhaps after a dozen or less paroxysms of
        diminishing violence, he ends up with a dry, hacking cough which is not a paroxysm.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When this first cough shakes the whole body, whether it is a bronchitis
        or whooping cough, and the tongue is white, and there are more or less gastric disturbances,
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ant. crud</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It will change the whole aspect of the case at once. The chest remains
        sore, lame and bruised from the violence of the cough.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Stomach</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The stomach
        symptoms must be particularly considered.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Constant nausea, lump in the stomach, feeling all the time as if he had
        an overloaded stomach, as if he had eaten too much, and that is when he had not eaten at
        all.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The stomach feels distended although the abdomen is flat. He feels
        distended and vomits the contents of the stomach; he vomits slime after he has emptied the
        stomach of its contents; prolonged retching, nausea, sickening load in the stomach and it
        seems to go on and on.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The vomiting does not relieve and there is increasing exhaustion.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Liver</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Inflammation
        and hardness of the liver or any portion of it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pain in the region of the gall bladder. Great pain in the region of the
        liver, rending, tearing pains in the liver, jaundice is associated with these symptoms at
        times.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Abdomen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In the
        abdomen we have a group of symptoms; violent abdominal pains, burning, great distension;
        there appears to be an increasing distension as if by a screw, gradually forcing down upon
        something gradually increasing the tension.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We find this state in the tympanitic condition of typhoid fever, we find
        it in cases of flatulence, we find it in summer diarrheas.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It will be associated with gastric symptoms and the white tongue,
        especially if such disturbance had been brought on by drinking sour wine, by taking a cold
        bath, in one who has a gouty constitution, where the nodules in the finger joints become
        painless and the stomach and bowels become distended and painful.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Diarrhea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This remedy
        has a nondescript diarrhea, but also a lumpy and liquid diarrhea.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Diarrhea from sour wine. It seems to take a long time to empty the
        bowels. He hurries to stool and passes a little lump and some liquid, and is soon hurried
        again to stool and more lumps and liquid are passed, and this goes on in summer diarrheas
        until finally the bowel is emptied and then there is great tenesmus.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a diarrhea ending in dysentery; inflammation of the rectum and
        colon, with suffering, much tenesmus, prolonged efforts and great exhaustion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Troublesome hemorrhoids in old gouty constitutions. They are always sore
        and inflamed from a cold, wet day, from cold bathing and, are always worse if he is foolish
        enough to drink sour wine or take sour food.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The stomach, bowel, rectum and hemorrhoidal complaints are all worse from
        disordering the stomach with sour wine, sour fruit or indigestible substances from cold
        bathing and wet weather.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Female</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The pelvic
        viscera become greatly relaxed, especially in women, so much so that there is a dragging
        down in the pelvis.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It seems as though the contents of the pelvis would be expelled, or would
        fall out. There is prolapsus of the uterus and a discharge resembling leucorrhoea .</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Disturbances of various kinds at the menstrual period.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Irritable and painful ovaries, such as we find associated with hysterical
        girls; those who suffer from unrequited affections; dreamers.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Sweat</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This medicine
        produces sweating; copious, exhaustive sweats, night sweats, such as we find in lingering
        diseases.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sweats from the slightest exertion. If he becomes slightly overheated he
        fairly boils with perspiration and then takes cold.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The skin is
        ulcerated and has a tendency to grow warts, callosities, bad nails and bad hair.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hard, horny excrescences grow under the nail and are extremely painful.
        From the ends of the fingers little horn-like excrescences appear.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The slightest pressure will produce a callosity, or a sore place, and in
        working men you will find an unusual tendency to thickening of the skin on the soles of the
        feet.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They are very sore to walk upon, because these callous places are
        sensitive and have numerous centres of little corns. The tendency to build up and indurate
        belongs to the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Warts grow upon the hands. The hair is unhealthy. Pustules form upon the
        skin with red areola.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pustular eruptions have an inflamed base that is red, and sensitive.</p>
        <p align="justify">Now, if you will study the proving and get the particulars of the remedy,
        and fit them into this framework, you will understand something of Ant. crud.</p>
