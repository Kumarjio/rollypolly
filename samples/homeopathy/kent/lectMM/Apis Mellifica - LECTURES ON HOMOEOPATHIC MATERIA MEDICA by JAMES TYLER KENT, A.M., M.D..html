        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This remedy has
        so many symptoms on the surface of the body we will study the outer aspect first. All over
        the body is found a thick rash, sometimes of a rose color.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is rough and can be felt as a rough rash under the fingers. The
        patient at this time is greatly distressed by heat and the skin is sensitive to touch with
        the rash or without it. Nodular swellings here and there come and go.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Then comes an erysipelatous inflammatory condition, in patches, here and
        there, about the head, with great tumefaction about the face, eyes and eye-lids.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Erysipelas may occur anywhere, but it more commonly belongs to the face
        and runs to a high degree of inflammatory action, with stinging, burning and oedema. In the
        extremities we have a marked dropsy, swelling with pitting upon pressure.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A general anasarca may appear. The face is greatly swollen at times, the
        eyelids look like water bags, the uvula hangs down like a water bag, the abdominal walls are
        of great thickness and pit upon pressure, and the mucous membranes in any part look as if
        they would discharge water if they were punctured.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Puffing or oedema, with pitting upon pressure, is a general condition
        that may be present in any inflammatory state, There is a general amelioration from cold and
        aggravation from heat. The skin symptoms and the patient are aggravated from heat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This prevails also in the mental state, in inflammatory conditions; in
        cardiac conditions, in dropsy, in sore throat, etc. Sometimes this aggravation amounts to
        aggravation from warm drinks, warm room, warm clothing, warmth of the fire, etc.,; if it is
        heat the patient is greatly disturbed.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Brain</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In brain
        troubles, if you put an Apis patient with congestion of the brain into a warm bath he will
        go into convulsions, and consequently warm bathing is not always "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">good for fits</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is taught in old school text-books so much that the old women and
        nurses know that a hot bath is good for fits, and before you get there just as like as not
        you will have a dead baby.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This congestion of the brain, with little twitchings and threatening
        convulsions, makes them put the baby in a hot bath, and it is in an awful state when you get
        there. If the baby needs </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium or Apis </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">in congestion of the brain the fits become worse by
        bathing in hot water.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If the nurse has been doing that kind of business you have learned the
        remedy as soon as you enter the house, for she will say the child has been worse ever since
        the warm bath, has become pale as a ghost and she was afraid he was going to die.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There you have convulsions worse from heat, pointing especially to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium and Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. That is the way with Apis all through. It is not laid down in the books
        that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is worse in the throat symptoms from warm drinks and wants
        altogether cold things, and will not take warm things which aggravate, but one of our
        graduates wrote me that by making use simply of the generals, as he had been instructed, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        conforming to all the rest of the case, he made a beautiful cure of a case of diphtheria
        which had the relief from cold, which shows how generals are continued into particulars and
        how they can be made use of.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The generals continue to build and enlarge our Materia Medica. Upon the
        outer surface then we see that Apis is full of dropsy, red rash, eruptions, urticaria,
        erysipelas, which inflammations extend to the mucous membranes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The outer part of man is his skin and mucous membrane. When we are
        dealing with man from centre to circumference, we think of the innermost as the brain and
        heart and internal organs that are vital, while their coatings and coverings are external.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Apis affects the things that are external; it affects the envelopes, the
        coverings. You notice how frequently it affects the skin and the tissues near the skin, and
        it also affects the envelopes or coverings of organs; for example, the pericardium. It
        establishes serous inflammations with effusion. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> produces an
        inflammation of the membranes of the brain. In the serous sac which encloses the heart,
        pericardium, and also in the peritoneum it produces the same kind of inflammation.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Thus we see that the coverings are especially affected by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">,
        viz., the skin and mucous membranes and the coverings of organs; and with these we get
        dropsy, catarrh and erysipelas.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In all of these inflammatory conditions there is stinging and burning;
        burning like coals of fire at times, and stinging as if needles or small splinters were
        sticking in.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">: The <i>mental
        symptoms </i>of Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> are very striking,
        and the most striking thing throughout the mental state is the aggravation from heat and
        from a warm room,</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The symptoms themselves are great sadness, constant tearfulness without
        any cause, weeping night and day; cannot sleep from tantalizing thoughts and worrying about
        everything.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Depression of spirits with constant weeping. Sadness and melancholy;
        extreme irritability; borrowing trouble about everything. Foolishly suspicious and jealous.
        Absolutely joyless. Absolutely indifferent to everything that would make her happy or
        joyful.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">No ability to apply things that would make her happy to herself, they
        must mean someone else. Foolish, silly, childish behavior in a woman in confinement, in a
        woman in advanced years; talking foolish twaddle, such as a child would talk, on serious,
        occasions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another aspect of the mental state is the delirium, which comes on in
        serious forms of brain affections in children. The child gradually goes into a state of
        unconsciousness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Lies in a stupor, one side of the body twitching the other side motion
        less, rolling head from side to side; head drawn -back rigidly; pupils contracted or
        dilated, eyes very red, face flushed, a stupid state or state of semi-consciousness. Child
        lying with the eyes partly, closed, as if benumbed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is suitable in congestion of the brain, meningitis or cerebro-spinal
        meningitis with opisthotonos when all the symptoms are aggravated from heat.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Child</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The child puts
        on a more dreadful state if the room becomes overheated; become extremely death-like or pale
        if the room becomes overheated.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If the child is able to do so it kicks the covers off. If it is in a
        position where it can look into a large open grate it will be much aggravated. I have seen </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        children who had to be removed from near an open fire.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They will cry, to get away from the heat that comes upon them from the
        register or open fire. The heat increases every symptom, and sometimes causes them to break
        out in a cold sweat all over the body, which does not ameliorate their fever nor the burning
        heat.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Very often the head is rolling and tossing, the teeth gnashing, and the
        eyes flashing with threatening convulsions, the child carrying the hand to the head at
        times, a state of semi-consciousness, and the child screams out with that peculiar scream
        which is known to mean congestion of the brain - </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">cri encéphalique</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> - the
        brain cry.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The shriek is a very strong </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> feature. The child
        cries out with this shriek in sleep when going into brain troubles. It says in the text:</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sopor interrupted by piercing shrieks."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We must be able to see in the general beginning of provings the disease
        which they resemble, for we do not always see the remedy in the advanced state.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We see the diseases in a state of progress, and must be able to see it in
        its beginning. As was the disease in the beginning so was the remedy in the beginning.
        Things that have similar beginnings may have similar endings.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> also has
        muttering, delirium and loquacity. All kinds of screaming and shrieking, shrill and
        otherwise, violent and less violent. Premonition of death, dread of death, fear of apoplexy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        The whole nervous system shows a disturbance in co-ordination. This disturbance in
        co-ordination runs through the remedy, awkwardness, staggering with the eyes shut.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Dizziness when the eyes are shut.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Ailments from fright, rage, vexation, jealousy or hearing bad
        news."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"After severe mental shock paralyzed on the whole right side."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Violence and rapidity</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        The complaints of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> are attended with violence and rapidity. They come on
        with great rapidity, rush on with violence, until unconsciousness is reached. It has been my
        fortune to see many violent cases of poisoning from the sting of the honey-bee.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When the over sensitive patient is poisoned by the sting he is dreadfully
        sick. The majority of people in the course of their life have been stung by the honey-bee
        and a mere little swelling occurs in the region of the sting, a swelling as big as a robin's
        egg or 4 hen's egg at most, without constitutional states; that is, when the individual is
        not sensitive to Apis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He may have been stung in half a dozen places, and each one gives him a
        little lump.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But you meet one who is sensitive to the sting of the honey-bee, and if
        he gets one little sting on any place in his body, he comes down with nausea and anxiety
        that makes him feel that he is dying, and in about ten minutes he is covered with urticaria
        from head to foot; he stings and burns and wants to be bathed in cold water; he fears that
        he will die if something is not done to mitigate his suffering, rolls and tosses as if he
        would tear himself to pieces.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">I have seen all these symptoms come on after </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. The
        antidote for that </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">is Carbolic acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. I </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">have seen </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbolic</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">administered in that state, and the patient described the sensation of the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbolic acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">going down his
        throat as a cooling comfort.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He says:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Why, doctor, I can feel that dose go to the ends of my
        fingers."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When you administer an antidote under such circumstances listen to what
        your patient says. When you get the true natural antidote, and, at times, when you get the
        true curative medicine in a case, no matter how high the potency is, the patient will say:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"I feel that to the roots of my hair and to the ends of my
        toes."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Such is the feeling it gives when the true antidotal medicine goes to the
        innermost portions of his economy, and that is the way we want to get our medicines always,
        to be guided by the symptoms of our patient that they will tell us what medicine to
        administer, and when the medicine is administered its highest reaction is of that sort.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: If we are well
        acquainted with the symptoms of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> we can many times get along without having a
        specialist to treat the eyes. They make more people blind with their lotions, caustic
        solutions, etc., than they benefit.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The old-fashioned way was to cauterize with copper and silver nitrate
        solution, and the modern things are not much better. At the present day, the homoeopathic
        physician who is not capable of taking eye symptoms as well as lung symptoms and symptoms of
        any part of the body is not competent to practice medicine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Eye cases can be prescribed for by the physician. In Homoeopathy there is
        no such thing as treating the eye and other organs of the body, but the patient with all his
        organs, not the patient with one or two organs.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a great remedy
        for the eyes. It has deep-seated inflammatory complaints of the eyes as a result of disease.
        Inflammations that are erysipelatous in character, that leave thickening of the mucous
        membrane and lids, and white spots over the eye; opacities.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        inflammatory condition is active it is attended with oedema of the lids, both upper and

        after a bee sting.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The swelling of the mucous membranes of the lids is so enormous that they
        roll out, looking like pieces of raw beef. The fluid will run out over the cheeks in great
        abundance. Burning and stinging like fire, better from washing, from cold applications,
