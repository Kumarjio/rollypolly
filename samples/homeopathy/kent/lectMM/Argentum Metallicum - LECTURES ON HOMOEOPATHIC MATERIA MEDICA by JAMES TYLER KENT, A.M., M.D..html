        take up the study of Metallic silver.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">No wonder that this remedy is a very deep acting remedy, for it has been
        used symbolically, and medically throughout all history.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has been a valuable substance throughout all history. It is an anti
        psoric and from its symptoms. I believe it to be an anti-sycotic. It goes into the life.
        Especially affects the nerves, nerves sheaths. Has complaints along the nerves.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All cartilages in the body are affected by it. It produces a hypertrophy
        of cartilages, a thickening of the cartilaginous portions of joints, of the cartilage of the
        ears, and of the nose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Produces cartilaginous growths and tumors; infiltrations. It affects the
        nerve substance, it is a deep organic remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is more than an ordinary remedy, for it affects all there is of man.
        In those nerve fibers especially that carry messages. It affects the brain in a very
        profound manner, bringing about changes and a gradual softening.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: A strange
        feature about it in its general action upon man is that is singles out mostly the
        intellectual faculties.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It scarcely disturbs his affections; only makes slight and vague changes
        in his voluntary system.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the memory, the intellectual part of man is disturbed increasingly to
        imbecility. In great sufferings and it is full of suffering - it affects his ability to
        reason.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In nearly all the headaches and pains in the back, and the rending<i>, </i>tearing
        pains that it produces over the body, it disturbs his memory and reasoning faculties.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Disturbs his ability to think. And it comes on in persons who are in the
        habit of laboring with the intellectual faculties.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Business men, students, readers, and thinkers. Reasoners come to a point
        when they can no longer reason and the slightest mental effort brings on vertigo.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is fatigued. All symptoms are worse after sleep. Instead of being
        rested for the day, he wakes in the morning with mental fatigue and weakness, so that he can
        hardly move, and it is with great difficulty that he gets himself together for a mental or
        physical effort of another day.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: If he
        undertakes to do any more mental work, he gets a headache. Headache mostly in the front of
        the head, but also in the occiput.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another strange feature about it, it is full of rending, tearing pains
        along the nerves, predominantly of the lower extremities.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tearing, as if the nerves would be torn in pieces (<i>during rest).</i></p><i>
        </i>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cold, damp weather, stormy weather will bring on rheumatism - not so much
        with swelling, although it has that, but pains apparently in the cartilages, and pains along
        the nerves.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">And these pains are so severe that he cannot keep still. Hence, it has a
        rheumatic state, from cold, damp weather, from becoming chilled, in the joints and in the
        nerves, so that be walks and walks.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many symptoms are better from especially walking. So tired and exhausted,
        but die pain is so severe that it drives him to walk. These pains are many times palliated
        by copious drafts of coffee, and this will suppress the sickness, and leave upon him all
        sorts of difficulties, under which he is threatening with break down, and in time be becomes
        almost useless.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Mental weakness. Physical prostration."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Rending, tearing pains, Affections of the joints, the cartilages of the
        joints. Tearing pains along the bones and he is really a wreck, an old broken down
        constitution when he is yet young.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"A man of forty is like one of eighty."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All these pains are better from motion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, it full of infiltrations. Inflamed cartilages infiltrate and form
        into hard knots. A superabundance of cartilaginous tissue, so that round about the joints
        the cartilages are thickened.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the ear and nose the cartilage is thickened. The infiltration that
        belongs to epithelioma. It has been a wonderful palliative in scirrhus, and in epithelioma.
        It has cured epithelioma.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is on record as curing pp epithelioma of the cervix uteri.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Ulceration everywhere; but ulcers that have their beginning in the
        cartilaginous tissue and. break out through the cellular tissue, and copiously discharge.
        The ulcers infiltrate at. their base, and become hard.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another marked feature is that it affects both testes, but it has a
        predominant action in the right. The left ovary and the right testis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Such things are singular, that in one sex it should produce symptoms in
        one side of the body, and in the other sex on the, opposite side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has cured. all sorts of tumors enlargement of the ovary, and
        infiltrations of the tissues. It is a chilly remedy. Wants to be kept warm and its pains are
        ameliorate by heat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Its headaches are ameliorated by heat - are ameliorated by pressure, by
        bandaging. I have orated by heat. I have many times cured these symptoms in headaches when
        the patient had the head wrapped up.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, in this medicine we class the patient as one having a lack of vital
        heat. He wants to be warm. Likely to be lean, growing increasingly lean, increasingly
        nervous, increasingly sensitive.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Takes on all sorts of whims. Women needing Silver very often do such
        strange and unaccountable things in (compare <i>Argentum nitricum) </i>their nervous states
        that they bar out all sympathy of their friends, and are called hysterical.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Deep seated trouble of the nerves. Growing increasingly sensitive to
        surroundings.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, the mental state of Argentum met. is just such as is aroused by
        confusion, just such as is I aroused by the emotions, just such as the loss of balance from
        fear, from anger, from fright, from disturbance of the mind.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Because this patient is so sensitive to his surroundings and so disturbed
        by annoyance. With his pains he becomes delirious, and it is not that involuntary delirium
        that we see in low forms of fever, but he becomes wild and full of rage.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He takes on mental excitement, rage and a state in which he talks
        nonsense with great rapidity. Sometimes there is a stage of unusual excitement in his
        conversation all mixed up about the character of his thought.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All of the time looks as if he were intoxicated, and he flies from one
        subject to an other, and prattles. For a moment appearing to be very intense and very active
        in mind, and forgets all that he was talking about.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In society indisposition to talk.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Because he is incompetent. He is tired mentally and he forgets what he is
        talking about. Loses the thread of his discourse; and he dreads to talk because he gets
        complaints while talking. If compelled to answer, he becomes dizzy, and feels strange all
        over, and has nervous shakes or shocks.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">And shocks go over him when tired like an electric shock. It comes
        suddenly, but the most favourable time for that to come is just when he wants to go to
        sleep. He thinks, now he is away from all the troubles of the day and can, rest, and the
        instant sleep comes over him he is roused from head to foot a shock, and another one, and
        another one, sometimes the whole night he jerks from head to foot.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">His limbs jerks up, his lower limbs twitch and jerk, then he gets out of
        bed and walks - tries to walk it off. This comes out in the proving of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Argentum nitricum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">but it belongs as
        much to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Argentum met., and Argentum met</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has long cured it. In </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hahnemann's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        study of the remedy he lays down the importance of shock on going to sleep. Shocks in the
        limbs.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But it is an electric shock that causes the whole body to jerk. Anxious
        about the health. Thinks he is certainly breaking down, for he is growing weaker. He cannot
        walk, though he is growing increasingly restless. He cannot exercise mentally or physically
        without distress. From meditation or as soon as he enters a warm room he becomes dizzy and
        that is an exception belonging to a few of the head troubles and the sensorium; he usually
        is sensitive to cold. In the house when the room is close he becomes dizzy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has been an astonishing feature in this remedy that precisely at the
        hour of no great many troubles come on, and the pains and Hess Chills. Pains in the ovary at
        noon. Dizziness with vertigo as if intoxicated.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headaches are frontal and occipital. One-sided brain affection.
        One-sided headaches. Violent neuralgia in the head upon one side at a time, as if deep in
        the brain, as if involving one-half of the brain, Mostly the headaches have been on the
        right side-the one-sided headaches.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Those broken down patients that have become prostrated and over-wrought
        by exposure to the sun. Upon the scalp, the ears, here and there upon the body, itching
        places.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Itching and burning, like frost bite. It has an itching and burning like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Agaricus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">in the toes, in the
        ears, and he scratches the part, and scratching does not relieve it until the skin is off,
        until it oozes, but no relief from scratching.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Rawness in the ears, kept up by constantly boring and scratching in the
        ears. Scratching the skin off because of the tingling, itching and burning.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Another strange
        feature is that about the eyes. Silver affects the lids more than the globe. It affects the
        sight, producing dimness of vision, and loss of vision; but it produces infiltration of the
        lids, thickening of the lids until they are almost as hard as cartilage.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mucous membrane is infiltrated and hard, and the eyelids cannot be
        opened. They spasmodically close, they cannot be pulled apart except by violence. It is a
        blepharitis, with thickening and infiltration.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Copious discharge. Now, as we strike this as a catarrhal region, let me
        say that all through the remedy we will find passive catarrhal discharges. In some instances
        thick and yellow, but at the same time passive, a passive state of the mucous membrane. But
        the characteristic, the principal discharge of Argentum met. is gray, thick, tenacious
        mucus.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He expectorates from the lungs-and from the air passages, from the
        trachea and from the larynx, gray mucus. Gray mucus from the vagina, gray mucus from the
        urethra, gray mucus from the eyes. Only in a few instances does it have yellow discharges.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When ulceration takes place, as in the larynx and on the eyelids, we have
        from this ulceration thick, yellow discharges; but from the ulcerated mucous surfaces it
        will generally be found to be gray, except in the urethra.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has cured old cases of chronic gonorrhoea. If we get the general
        character of the remedy we know what to expect when it goes to each region. If we do not
        know the general character of a remedy we do not know what to expect; and if we get into a
        region where we have the very opposite of it we know then that that is a particular, and
        does not conform to its generals.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But first of all we have to single out what is general, what may be
        expected, what belongs to the nature of the remedy, so that when we see its opposites we may
        recognize it and know it as an opposite, as a particular, and as an exception. Here is one
        of the characteristic features of Argentum itching.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Scratching until bleeding in the ear".</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, this itching involves the whole outside ear and extends into the
        ear, so he scratches the ear until it is red, and swollen, and bleeds.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The cartilage of that ear is lumpy and nodular; is infiltrated. The
        cartilages of the nose are also infiltrated. Argentum met. cures many of these cases that
        are operated on when they have some portion of the inside of the nose removed by the
        surgeon, so that the patient can breathe better.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Thickening of' the bones in the nose, the thickening and building
        up of the mucous membrane and the cellular tissue in the nasal passages."</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Argentum met</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is often
        indicated in such cases. This remedy has a very decided action. Infiltrations go on
        thickening and hardening, and then we have serum in joints. This is one of the most
        important remedies to know in the necrosis of cartilages every where in the body.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But with it must go such nervous and mental symptoms as the remedy has,
        such as I have described. The patient looks sickly, pale, careworn, tired. A broken down
        patient. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">An Argentum met</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. patient is a sickly one who should have had a

        the abdomen. If these progress from a catarrhal inflammation of the mucous membranes to a
        general congestion of all the tissues in the abdomen, diarrhea comes on, or constipation of
        the most inveterate character, tuberculosis of the mesenteric glands, emaciation, weakness,
        trembling.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Paralytic feelings here and there in the body. Painful soreness, in the
        whole abdomen in connection with the urinary troubles. It has a low form of tissue making,
        such as tuberculosis, cancerous affections, infiltrations, such as we have mentioned.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Dry stool, like sand. Undigested stool; very offensive. Catarrhal
        inflammation of the mucous membranes of the urinary passages, the whole urinary tract. It
        cures albuminuria; it cures diabetes, with sugar in the urine; and many of the broken-down
        conditions of the kidneys. Low, broken-down constitutions. Enormous quantities of whey-like
        urine. A copious flow of urine. Children lose the urine in sleep. Broken-down, nervous
        constitutions lose the urine in sleep.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Genitals</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It has a
        very decided action upon the genitalia of both male and female. In the male it especially
        affects the testes and the mucous tract. It, infiltrates the testes, producing hardness. In
        the text it reads;</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Inflammation with infiltration. Chronic orchitis. It has cured a very
        suspicious testicle believed to he a cancerous affection, which began in the epididymus,
        following a gonorrhoea. Inflammation, great hardness, pain, swelling, burning and stinging.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another symptom here is of great importance:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Yellowish-greenish gonorrhea of an indolent character from the

        <p align="JUSTIFY">That clinical symptom has been verified.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Now, it is a natural feature of gonorrhoea for the discharge to be
        yellow, or yellowish-green, and thick in the early stage, for it then to become lighter and
        lighter until it is whitish thick or thin, growing lighter in character until it becomes
        white and gleety. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Argentum met</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is the remedy when the discharge remains yellow.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        passive discharge, the urethra loses its sensitiveness to pain, and the mucous membrane
        loses its sensation to a great extent, but the thick greenish or yellowish discharge
        remains. Now, in these thick passive discharges that are long-standing, old cases, we are
        very much troubled to find remedies.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These old stubborn cases that still remain yellow, and still remain

        sitting. The cures have been predominantly of the left ovary, although, it cures complaints
        of both.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another grand feature - found in-this remedy is weakness, relaxation of
        muscles through the whole body; trembling; and now, if that thought is applied - if that
        feature of the remedy is observed in the pelvic organs - it will be seen that those muscles
        that hold up the uterus, the broad ligament, etc., are in a state of relaxation, they allow
        the uterus to sag. In other words, we get prolapsus.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Prolapsus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: You will be
        astonished to know that homoeopathic remedies are wonderful in their ability to create
        tonicity, and thereby restore the prolapsed uterus to its normal position, and to remove the
        dragging down feeling women generally describe, a sensation as if the inner parts were being
        forced out.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">All of these are sensations that accompany a prolapsus. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Argentum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is one of the medicines. In fact, the whole pelvic system is engorged
        increased in weight; tissues infiltrated likely to be hardened. Cervix congested and
        indurated. Takes on ulceration.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Greatly enlarged, congested. It has been a palliative medicine in
        epithelioma of the cervix, with burning, stinging pains, copious, putrid, yellowish-green
        and bloody discharge. It has cured a tendency to menorrhagia, copious menstrual flow; the
        relaxation that must be present in hemorrhages will soon be overcome when the symptoms
        agree, when the general state is present. Ulcer of the uterus; discharge purulent, ichorous.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sometimes bloody water, with unbearable stench."</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"In less than three days foul smell was lost entirely."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When a remedy acts in that manner it actually stops the growth. In fact,
        a cancerous state that would go on to its termination in fourteen to sixteen months will go
        two or three years and the patient remain comfortable.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The remedy that is indicated stops the ulceration, it checks the
        destruction, and keeps the patient comfortable and with her friends for years. In cancerous
        affections the state of life is very low. The state of order is generally beyond
        restoration.</p>

        we come to a state of the larynx. It is a wonderful laryngeal medicine. Loss of voice with
        inflammation, from overuse of the voice such as occurs in singers and talkers. One who is
        compelled to use the larynx much. It is then a paralytic weakness of the vocal cords.
        Running all through this remedy there is aggravation from any little prolonged exertion - a
        paralytic tendency wit aggravation from exertion.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So it is in the lungs - in every part of the body. And then comes the
        loss of voice. Now, apply all that we know of its ability to infiltrate.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We have tuberculosis of the larynx. Singers, public speakers, who are
        broken down, nervous, of poor digestion, bad inheritance, take on tuberculosis of the
        larynx, and the voice is lost. Ulceration follows. And this trouble finally goes into the
        lungs. They emaciate and get night sweats.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Loss of voice." Generally of a painful character.</p>

        wiry, getting about fairly well. Has inherited phthisis. The cough is a deep cough, is
        aggravated from laughing, talking and in a warm room. Laughing causes cough and causes mucus
        in the larynx.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This remedy will turn aside this threatening phthisis, this dry teasing
        cough. A little dry, hacking cough especially comes under this remedy. In no instance are we

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has a sense of weakness of the chest. There are two remedies having
        this weakness of the chest and you cannot easily tell them apart.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Weak voice, weak chest; a feeling that it is so difficult to, breathe,
        and so difficult to talk, and so difficult to cough, because the muscles of the chest feel

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Great weakness of the muscles of the chest. The patient dwells upon it
