        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: We shall find by
        examining the symptoms of this remedy that the intellectual feature predominates, as in the
        metal; that the affections are disturbed only in a limited way. There is a predominance of
        mental symptoms.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">First of all, disturbance in the memory, disturbance of reason, he
        becomes most irrational in his explanations of his actions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is irrational and does strange things and comes to strange
        conclusions; foolish things.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He has all sorts of imaginations, illusions, hallucinations. He is
        tormented in his mind by the inflowing of troublesome thoughts, and especially at night his
        thoughts torment him. to the extent that he is extremely anxious and this puts him in a
        hurry and in a fidget and he goes out and walks and walks, and the faster he walks the
        faster he thinks he must walk, and he walks till fatigued.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Strange notions and ideas and fears come into his mind. He has an impulse
        that lie is going to have a fit or that he is going to have a sickness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A strange thought comes into his mind that if be goes past a certain
        corner of the street he will create a sensation, will fall down and have a fit, and to avoid
        that he will go around the block.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He avoids going past that corner for fear he will do something strange,
        He is so reduced in his mental state that he admits into the mind all sorts of impulses.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is inflowing of strange thoughts into his mind, and when crossing a
        bridge or high place the thought that he might kill himself, or perhaps he might jump off,
        or what if he should jump off, and sometimes the actual impulse comes to jump off the bridge
        into the water.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When looking out of a window the thought comes to his mind what an awful
        thing it would be to jump out of the window, and sometimes the impulse comes to actually
        jump out of the window.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is fear of death, the over-anxious state, that death is near, and
        often at times like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">he predicts the moment he is going to die.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Looking forward to times he is anxious. When looking forward to some
        thing that he is about to do, or in the expectation of things, he is anxious.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When about to meet an engagement he is anxious until the time comes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If he is about to take a railroad journey he is anxious, full of fear and
        anxiety and tremulous nervousness until he is on the car going and then it passes away. If
        he is about to meet a certain person on the street corner he is anxious and breaks out often
        in a sweat from anxiety until it is over with.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Not only is this particular symptom present, but the symptoms come on as
        a result of his anxiety.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is excitable, angers easily, and as a result of this pain comes. When
        he becomes angry he becomes vehement and pain in the head comes on; cough, pain in the chest
        and weakness follow this anger</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The anxiety he has from these circumstances will bring on complaints.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When he is going anywhere, going to a wedding or to the opera, or any
        unusual event it is attended with anxiety, fear and diarrhea.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So it is we have in this a wonderful medicine. It says in the text that
        he gave all sorts of queer reasons for his strange conduct, endeavoring to cover up, as it
        were, his foolishness which he himself realizes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sadness, melancholy and confusion. Defective memory. The sight of high
        houses makes him dizzy, and his vertigo is increased or comes on from closing the eyes; with
        the vertigo there is buzzing in the ears, great weakness and trembling.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Constitutional headaches from brain fag, from exertion of the mind. In
        such mental exhaustion, headaches, nervous excitement and trembling, and organic troubles of
        the heart and liver in business men, in students, in brain workers, in those subject to long
        excitement; - in actors who have kept up a long time the excitement of appearing well in
        public.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This state of mind progress until there is a general state of weakness;
        with trembling, paralysis, numbness, disturbed functions, palpitation, throbbing all over
        the body, with the mental state.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The nervous state continues until there is disorder of all the organs of
        the body. The stomach refuses to digest, everything taken, seems to go into gas, and he
        becomes distended and suffers with pain.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The circulation seems to be greatly disturbed in addition to the
        palpitation. Fullness of the blood vessels and throbbing all over the body. The blood
        vessels become diseased.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Atheromatous degeneration and dilatation of the veins, varicose veins.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the mucous membranes and skin ulceration, and this progresses and
        the heart becomes increasingly feeble, and the extremities become cold and blue and the lips
        are cold and blue, with aggravation of all these complaints from mental excitement, from
        going to the opera, from meeting a friend, from keeping an engagement.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The medicine is preeminently a nervous one, full of spinal symptoms,
        rending, tearing pains down the extremities; such pains are found in locomotor ataxia
        fulgurating shooting pains.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is one grand feature running through this patient modifying most of
        his symptoms, with few exceptions, and that is that he is like a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pulsatilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        patient; he wants cold air, cold drinks, cold things; wants ice, ice cream; wants the head
        in the cold air; suffocates in a warm room.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He suffocates from warm clothing, wants the door and windows open; cannot
        breathe in a stuffy room, suffocates if other people are in the room; cannot go to church or
        to the opera, cannot go to places of amusement or gatherings, must stay at home.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He dreads a crowd, dreads certain places.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Ulcerations</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        Everywhere we find ulceration, but particularly upon the mucous membrane. The throat has
        ulcers in it, the eyelids, and of the cornea; ulceration of the bladder.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Ulcers of the uterus, of the vagina and of the external soft parts. This
        tendency of ulcerate seems rather strange, peculiar that it should have in its pathogenesis
        such a tendency, when the old school has been using it to cauterize ulcers, and yet it heals
        them up.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">We know that </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phosphorus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">will<i> </i>burn and it intensifies the tendency to ulcerate, makes the
        ulcer go deeper, while Argentum nitricum sets it healing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon mucous membranes we find red elevations, granulations, enlargement
        of vessels, purplish aspect. Sensitive ulcers.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Female</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The complaints
        in women come <i>on </i></font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">before and
        during</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> the menstrual period. It is a
        favorable time for all her complaints to be aggravated; if she have Argentum nitricum
        symptoms they are likely to be at their worst at this time.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She suffers from most violent dysmenorrhoea, from nervous excitement,
        from hysterical manifestations, and an unusually increased flow.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A tendency to hemorrhages it belongs to this remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The ulcers bleed; there is bleeding from the nose, bleeding from the
        chest, the urine is bloody; leucorrhoea copious, menstrual flow copious; menorrhagia;
        bleeding from the mucous membranes generally, from the uterus. Vomiting of blood. It has
        cured prolonged and most inveterate ulceration of the stomach, when there has been vomiting
        of blood.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The aggravation at the menstrual period is a strong feature and she is
        free from symptoms during the interim.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The palpitation, the trembling, the coldness of the surface, though
        desiring cold open air, blueness of the lips, coldness of the extremities, blueness and
        coldness of the lower extremities to the knees and of the hands and arms to the elbows, and
        yet the patient wants cool things, wants something cold.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This may not be seen at any other time. Here is striking feature:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Patient cannot lie on the right -side because it brings on so much
        palpitations."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">We have plenty of remedies with palpitation worse lying on the right side
        are rare</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000"> <i>(Alumen, Badiaga, Kalmia,
        Kali n., Lil. t., Platina, Spongia).</i></font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000"><i>
        </i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is uncommon, strange, rare and peculiar.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is such a strong feature in this remedy that to a great extent it
        becomes quite general, because it is a </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">heart</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">symptom and is intermingled with the general symptoms.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With this sensitiveness he is compelled to get into some other position;
        must get up and walk, because of lying on the right side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient will say he throbs from head to foot while lying on the right
        side. Do not forget in this medicine all these general things when we come to apply them in
        their particulars and the particulars in the generals.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Do not forget that this medicine is one of the most </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">flatulent</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">medicines in the
        books. He is distended to bursting; gets scarcely any relief from passing flatus or
        eructations.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is possessed with the distressing idea that all his undertakings must
        fail. When walking he becomes faint with anxiety which makes him walk faster. Everywhere you
        will find the intellectual symptoms predominant.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Headache</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        headaches are of a congestive character; considerable throbbing, ameliorated by cold, and
        tight bandaging. Headache from mental exertion from excitement, with vertigo, nausea and
        vomiting.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains in the right side of the head, jagging, cutting, stitching
        pulsating. Head feels much enlarged.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The eye symptoms
        are too numerous to mention. They are of a general character such as we find in catarrhal
        conditions with ulceration, relieved by cold.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All of the eye symptoms are worse in a warm room, worse from sitting by
        the fire. Wants cold applications, cold washing. Intense photophobia; aversion to light, and
        this is worse in a warm room; wants it cold, wants it dark.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is much swelling and tumefaction of the blood vessels of the eye,
        and redness, and it has a raw denuded excoriated appearance.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        long looking at fine sewing, fine print. In one who has suddenly taken on far sightedness,
        it has come on as a congestive condition; not of old age but something that should be cured.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All at once he cannot see print at the usual distance but must hold it
        away off; if it occurs in some one twenty-five years of age or in a child.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">At close distance it is indistinguishable. Such a disturbance of
        accommodation producing far sightedness it has caused and cured.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Oedema of lids," etc.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Oedema is a word which runs through the remedy. That is to say, it has a
        dropsical state wherever dropsy may occur.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The face is the

        throat symptoms. Another feature of this remedy is its general tendency to produce warts.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a tendency to favor the growth of warts and in the throat there
        are little wart-like growths polypoid growths in the throat and about the genitals and anus;
        hence its great use in sycotic constitutions.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">He cannot digest it; it acts like a physic and brings on a diarrhea. So
