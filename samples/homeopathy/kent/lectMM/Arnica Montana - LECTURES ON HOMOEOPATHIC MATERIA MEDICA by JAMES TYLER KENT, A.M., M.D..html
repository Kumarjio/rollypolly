        want to be talked to, does not want to be approached. He does not want to be approached,
        both because he does not wish to enter into conversation, a mental state, and also because
        he does not wish to be touched on account of the great bodily soreness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These are the two most striking things in this medicine. Irritable,
        morose, sad, fearful, easily frightened, imagines all sorts of things, especially that he
        has heart disease, or that he will mortify, or that some deep-seated trouble is upon him.
        Full of nightmare, dreadful dreams, dreams of muddy water, robbers, etc.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Horrors in the night. He frequently rouses up in the night, grasps at the
        heart, has the appearance of great horror, fears some dreadful thing will happen. A sudden
        fear of death comes on at this time, rousing him up in the night; he grasps at the heart,
        and thinks he is going to die suddenly. He is full of dreadful anguish, but finally he comes
        to himself, lies down and goes off into a sleep of terror, jumps up again with the fear of
        sudden death and says:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is repeated night after night in persons Who are fairly well in the
        daytime, who have no sympathy because there seems to be no reality in their sickness, only a

        through some shock, who are sore and bruised from injury.</p>

        with fever after an accident or injury, he becomes greatly prostrated, stupid and
        unconscious. He can be aroused and will answer a question correctly, but goes into a stupor,
        or be hesitates about a word and is unable to find correct words when trying to answer and
        goes back into the coma.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When roused up, he looks at the doctor and says:</p>

        there is nothing the matter with him. Such is the "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">shock</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" state, almost

        covered with red spots; the patient is constantly turning and that mental state is coming on
        with moroseness, and<i> </i>stupidity. It is a wonderful remedy, a misunderstood remedy, a
        misused remedy, because it is almost limited to bruises.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is one, of sheet anchors in certain seasons, in the malarial valleys
        of the West, for intermittent fever In congestive chills, in those dreadful attacks with

        <p align="JUSTIFY">From that it spreads on throughout the system, but hat horror of instant
        death is a striking feature and it comes on regardless of heart disease.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A horror in the night when there is nothing to come upon the patient; a
        horrible congestion, which affects especially the cerebellum and upper part of the spinal
        cord.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">There symptoms come in the low forms of disease, in the typhoid type of
        disease. Many of the remittent fevers, if badly treated, or permitted to run their course
        under bad nursing, will turn into a continued fever.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">While the true idiopathic typhoid comes on after many weeks of gradual
        decline, a symptomatic typhoid may come on suddenly, and it has symptoms of graver form than
        ordinary typhoid. The idiopathic typhoid will seldom kill and will generally run to a
        favourable termination, if the doctor stays at home.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is full of delirium in these low types of fever, even

        with this mental state thoroughly in mind, we are prepared to take up the general physical
        state, which has in all complaints, all over the body a feeling as if bruised. It is not
        strange that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arnica</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is used for bruises, but it is very foolish to put it
        on the outside and to rub it on in the form of the tincture.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It produces in its pathogenesis mottled spots, like bruises. If you take </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arnica</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> internally, in large doses, you will have mottled spots, bluish spots,
        which become yellowish, due to ecchymoses, from extravasations of the smaller capillaries.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is, to a certain extent, what takes place in bruising. It is an
        extravasation of blood from the capillaries, and sometimes from the larger vessels.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But all over the body he is sore and bruised, as if he had been beaten.
        If you watch an </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arnica</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient in order to get the external manifestations
        of his state, you will see him turning and moving.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will at once ask yourself, Why is he restless? and if you compare
        remedies in your mind, you will say, He is like <i>Rhus tox.; </i>he stays in a place a
        little while and then he moves.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">No matter if he is only semi-conscious; you will see him make a little
        turn, part way over, and then a little further over, and so on until he is over on the other
        side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Then he commences again, and he will shift a little and a little, and so
        he turns from side to side. The question is, why does he move so, why is he restless?</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is an important matter to solve.

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">he will tell us that the bed feels hard. That is one way of telling that
        the body is sore.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A more intelligent individual will say it is because he is so sore and
        feels as if bruised and beaten, and he wants to get into a new place.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Soreness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This state
        of soreness is present if it be a symptomatic typhoid, an intermittent fever, a remittent
        fever, or after an injury when he is really bruised all over. You get the same continual
        uneasiness and motion, moving every minute. He moves and thinks that now he will be
        comfortable, but he is comfortable only for a second.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The soreness increases the longer he lies, and becomes so great that he

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The parts that are inflamed bleed. He is subject to catarrhal conditions,

        is streaked with blood, or dotted with tiny pin-head blood clots. His urine contains blood
        and there is bleeding from the various orifices of the body. There is not sufficient tone in

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">All over the body there is a lameness, and soreness, and a feeling as if
        bruised; a rheumatic lameness; the joints are swollen, sore and lame. If an acute disease

        increasing soreness in the muscles. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arnica</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is very suitable for that sore, bruised condition of
