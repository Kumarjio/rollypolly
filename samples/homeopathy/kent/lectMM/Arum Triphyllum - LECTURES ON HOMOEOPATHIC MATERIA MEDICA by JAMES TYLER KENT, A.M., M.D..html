        <p align="JUSTIFY">(Indian Turnip)</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Many
        boys have wandered in the low grounds where this wild turnip grows, and have taken a nip out
        of it, and probably remember the sensations in the mouth that they received at that time.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I distinctly remember making an endeavor to enjoy a piece of wild turnip.
        The tingling that is left in the lips and tongue and from the throat to the end of the nose,
        and wherever sentient nerves come to the surface, is astonishing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The prickling and tingling is painful. It is a sensation that cannot be
        let alone. It requires a continued manipulation, and from this we gather the sensations that
        must be present in children when they are suffering from acute diseases and this remedy is
        indicated.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">For, in spite of the rawness and bleeding and smarting of the parts, they
        will insist on pinching and scratching and picking the lips and pressing around the mouth
        and boring into the nose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has been a guiding feature in acute diseases, scarlet fever, many
        throat affections, diseases that take on a low type, such as continued fever and eruptive
        fevers.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Among other complaints, sore throats, zymotic affections, delirium and
        excitement, even maniacal manifestations. It is manifested to a great extent in these
        associated symptoms. It must be that there is in the nose and lips painful tingling that the
        patient persists in boring the fingers into the nose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Manipulating and pinching the lips, picking the lips. It is altogether a
        different symptom that occurs in delirium of a low, muttering type, which we call
        carphologia, picking the bed clothes, picking all the time, picking and handling the
        clothing, a busy, low form of muttering, must be doing something all the time groping around
        with the fingers and feeling for something.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This is the carphologia and it is a mental symptom. While "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">picking the lips</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" is given under the "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">mental</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" symptoms in
        the repertory, it is not intended to mean that it is a mental symptom like carphologia.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, you will find two expressions in the repertory, and it is necessary
        to have two - the one is that</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"the nose itches," and the other is "he rubs the
        nose,"</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">he does something; that is what an individual would do if his nose
        itched. One's mind is not always directed towards the two-one is a direct and the other is
        an indirect expression.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy has not been sufficiently proved to bring out the nature of
        its chronic manifestations. It has undoubtedly something of that kind, but it has been used
        in a limited way among acute affections of a zymotic character. It has not been used to any
        great extent for chronic sick headaches, but it has cured some headaches that are worse in
        the heat, worse in a warm room and from warm clothing, worse from becoming warm, worse from
        wrapping up the body.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Heat in the head, determination of blood to the head. It has also cured
        eruptions upon the scalp like eczema.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Nose</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It has also been
        found useful in catarrhal affections of the nose, eyes and lids. About the nose its
        affections have been mostly of the acute kind. It has most dreadful coryza,</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The nose is stopped up, and more stopped up on the left side. Must
        breathe through the mouth. Sneezing worse during the night; fluent acrid coryza. The
        discharge of saliva flowing over the lips produces rawness, smarting and burning of the
        mucous membranes, and the lips, bleed. The fluid from the nose as it flows over the skin
        leaves red streaks.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Acrid ichorous discharge excoriating the inside of the nose, the
        alae and upper lip."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is expressive and occurs in diphtheria; in various forms of sore
        throat, in scarlet fever, when this remedy is indicated.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Inflammation of the tongue, with acrid discharge from the nose.
        Inflammation of the root of the tongue, of the throat and soft palate, of the tonsils. The
        glands of the neck are swollen.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This inflammatory condition is followed by paralytic weakness, making it
        impossible for him to swallow liquids or food, and when the mouth forces food into the
        pharynx the oesophagus refuses to operate, and then fluids and liquids are forced up into
        the nose and run out of the nose.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This has been clinically observed many times in diphtheria and sore
        throats. The sneezing is like an ordinary coryza, with repeated chills over the body, and
        aching in the bones as if the bones would break, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Nux, Eupator., Arn., Rhus, Bry. and Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">that have aching

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This is one of the most striking medicines as an illustration of the
        keynote system, that is, with those who prescribe on one symptom and give this medicine
        whenever the patient bores his nose or picks his lips, notwithstanding that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        congestive and nerve symptoms. The nostrils are really so sore from the acridity of the
        fluids inside of the nose that it feels as if the nostrils were filled with fire. This is
        the language of the patients who narrate their symptoms in an </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arum triphyllum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        case.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They come into the office with a sore, raw nose, and it tingles and
        tickles and he cannot let it alone. Fluids run down over the lip and excoriate. The glands
        of the neck are often enlarged. When he takes cold in one nose there is soreness of the neck
        and parotid gland.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will see children boring in the nose, inside of nose. it is an
        inflammation of the nasal duct, the duct that leads from the eye to the nose, and
        accompanied by a discharge of tears over the cheeks, with the tickling that extends up there
        which they cannot reach, but they undertake to reach it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Can hardly talk on account of phlegm in the back part of the nose. He
        talks through the nose. The nose is filled with mucus and there is great tumefaction of all
        the mucous membranes; which gives him a nasal tone.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mouth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There is
        bleeding of the lips, upper and lower. The under lip especially is denuded and drops of
        blood stand upon it, and the patient is constantly picking and pinching the lips, and when
        you request of the little one to stop it or take his hands away he yells with a sort of
        sepulchral yell.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Children will often pick and bore into raw surfaces, though it
        gives them pain and they scream with it, but they keep on boring."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is a striking symptom. Fluids make the lips raw and then this
        tickling comes on and he cannot let it alone, ho must keep at it.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Appearance of raw bleeding surfaces on the lips, buccal cavity,
        nose, etc."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Great itching tingling describes it. In typhoid, where you would hardly
        expect much swelling of the parotid, these glands are enlarged. In diphtheria, scarlet fever
        and sore throat enlargement of the salivary glands.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This inflammatory condition with soreness and swelling of these glands;
        the glands are hard and tender to the touch. The tongue is red, the papillae elevated; the
        tongue appears to be almost denuded. It is raw and bleeding, sometimes does bleed in a few
        places, and sometimes, after this has gone on for a few days, when the tongue is projected
        it looks like a big red straw berry, and for that reason has been called</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Strawberry tongue."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Tongue cracked, bleeding, burning, painful; smarting on tongue and
        fauces."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Putrid odor from the mouth. Mouth foul, so sore that he was unwilling to
        drink. All this points to tingling and raw condition of the buccal cavity far back into the
        throat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If you look into the buccal cavity you will see the parts raw, denuded
        and bleeding. Excessive flow of saliva, which is acrid. Mouth burns and is sore. Cries when
        anything is offered. Buccal cavity covered with diphtheritic ulcers, also with aphthous
        patches, which cover the whole mouth and tongue.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It says "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">stinging</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," but it is a painful tingling, stinging like
        the sting of a bee, stinging pains in the throat, and the parts are ulcerated, raw and
        bleed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Stools</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It has a
        diarrhoea such as occurs in idiopathic typhoid. If you have ever seen the yellow corn-meal
        mush when it is dropped on a plate, it has the appearance of the typhoid yellow stools. When
        this medicine is suitable diarrhoea is yellow like corn-meal; frequent, faecal, thin, mushy,
        yellow, is the description of this typhoid stool.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are other times that the stool is dark brown, watery, thin. As is
        usual, the faeces are acrid. The thin faeces escape from the anus and keep the parts raw and
        burning. With other complaints, in typhoid especially, in the groin where the thigh bends
        upon the abdomen an excoriation takes place with acrid moisture.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, we notice rawness over the coccyx. A moisture and rawness from
        acrid fluid in the posterior part of the fissure back of the anus so that over the coccyx
        and back of the anus there is rawness and acrid moisture.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Voice</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The voice comes
        in for art extensive part of the trouble. It has been found especially to relate to singers
        and public speakers.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">At times when a lawyer has had a long case and he is making a final
        effort, and has been speaking three or four hours, and while in a sweat has got into a draft
        or gone out, he finds himself hoarse and cannot finish Ids speech, a dose of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arum triph</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. will enable him to go on with his speech in a clear voice.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If clears up the hoarseness. In public speakers and singers who have been
        compelled to strain the voice and have taken a little cold and the voice is hoarse after
        prolonged exercise; this is the most striking feature of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arum triph</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        voice.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Voice hoarse; from over-exertion of the voice is speaking or
        singing."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Voice uncertain, uncontrollable, changing continually, now deep,
        now hoarse, etc."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It manifests itself in this way. A person starts in a certain pitch and
        he cannot talk to you, but he tries another pitch and can talk. It is a queer thing that on
        certain notes they are voiceless, which shows that there is an irregular and patchy
        inflammation of the vocal cords; it is not a uniform inflammation or the voice would be
        uniformly affected.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">"</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Clergyman's sore
        throat</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," is not a good expression,
        because it is clergyman's hoarseness that is meant; hoarseness and rawness of the throat of
        public speakers when talking.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course you would say any voice that is hoarse is aggravated when
        talking, but it is not always so.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">hoarseness carries with it its characteristic relief from motion, and the
        use of the voice is motion of the larynx.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus
        patient</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">commences to use the voice he finds that he is hoarse, but after
        using the voice a little it loosens up, becomes freer, or, in other words, it is better from
        motion. This may be so either in acute or chronic hoarseness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Now, in this remedy as in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phosphorus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">the voice is ameliorated from clearing the vocal cords
        of a little mucus. It is not so in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus
        tox</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">for it is a weakness and paralysis from cold. It is well known
        under </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus tox.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">that the tendons and muscles that are rheumatic become weak, they are stiff
        on beginning to move and are ameliorated when they are warmed up; so it is with the voice.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Chest</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Now, in the
        chest there is burning and rawness when coughing; this extends to the pit of the stomach.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Raw feeling in chest."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Lungs feel sore."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Soreness in l. lung."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will notice that many times patients and provers state sufferings are
        in the lungs, which may not really be the region affected. Most likely from what is known of
        other symptoms this burning is in the trachea, although it says in the lungs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy does have burning in the trachea, the whole length of it,
        during an attack of coughing, and burning in the larger branches of the bronchial tubes. The
        catarrhal state is largely confined to these parts, the trachea and bronchi, but this
        medicine has cured pneumonia It has been found useful as a palliative in phthisis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is used in crude form among the farmers as a domestic medicine for
        coughs and colds and as a palliative, in consumption. In many of the farm houses you will
        find the wild turnip hung up in strings like heads to be dried and, grated and used with
        sugar and cream.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I mentioned the fact that it seems to favor the left side of the head,
        the left nostril, the left side of the face. It also prefers the left chest and the left
        lung. It has soreness in the left side of the chest and left arm. it has a sensation of
        fullness in the thorax and soreness extending down and involving the left lung.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is a clinical picture of fever:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Typhoid forms of fever; picking ends of fingers and dry lips till
        they bleed, etc."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In most of these complaints the urine is very scanty and is sometimes
