        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Introduction</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This
        remedy in olden times was frequently abused for man and beast. Our grandfathers supposed it
        was a protection against disease and hence they used it in the stables.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Lumps of "foetty," as they called it, where put in the corn for
        the horse, to keep off</font><font face="Arial" size="1" color="#0000ff"> </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">distempter.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">What it has accomplished I am unable to say, but it is certain that these
        farmers looked upon </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Asa foetida</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> as a great protective against disease.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has been used also by the laity as a medicine for fainting, for
        hysteria, and all sorts of nervous symptoms and complaints.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The use is justified by the proving. These things are scarcely worthy of
        note, but it shows the general use among the people, as a domestic medicine, in crude form.
        It has been used more extensively in this form than in professional practice in a legitimate
        way.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Aspect</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There is one
        class of patients you will find who will trouble you. Those cases that come into your office
        with puffed, venous, purple faces; they have an appearance of plethora; the face looks
        puffed, bloated and dropsical at times; it is a dark red, dusky face; such a face we shall
        cure sometimes with </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Asa foetida</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo an., Aurum, Carbo veg. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and <i>Pulsatilla</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i> </i>are
        also related to this kind of face, but it is a very troublesome face, it shows more or less
        cardiac disturbance and venous stasis.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The venous side of the heart will often be involved, or be about to be
        involved, when you have this kind of face.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I never like to see them come into my office, for they are hard cases to
        manage. They have deep-seated troubles, with bleeding, they are subject to sudden
        inflammations, and they do not rally quickly.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Constitution</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In this
        constitution we have ulcerations; a little place will ulcerate and suppurate, and the
        ulceration will burrow; this is just what this remedy does.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another thing this kind of constitution will do is to set up an
        inflammatory condition of the periosteum with swelling, periostitis of the tibia for
        instance, where the circulation is not very active; inflammation of cartilages with
        tumefaction and purple skin, stitching pains and dropsy, ulcerations and fistulous openings.
        This medicine is good for just such states.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Ulcers with extreme sensitiveness."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Patients often say,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"I get no sympathy when I am sick because I look so well;" fat,
        flabby and purple.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This remedy will seldom be thought of in lean persons; they seem to be
        free from complaints like those of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Asa
        foetida</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, but in fat, flabby persons,
        extremely nervous, extremely sensitive to pain, full of hysteria.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Purple when out in the cold, purple when excited. In other words, you see
        before you the venous constitution, and these people get the worst kind of hysteria; they go
        off almost from no cause into fainting; from a close room, from excitement, from any
        disturbance; sometimes cramps come on, but more especially fainting.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They are subject to stitching pains from the bone to the surface; that
        is, from within out. The periosteum, becomes irritated, and glands become swollen.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Syphilis sometimes produces this kind of condition. Vascular disturbances
        in the body; periostitis, necrosis, induration of glands, nerve syphilis and head pains. in
        old syphilitics with this kind of venous face, subject to bleeding, ulcers turn black or
        become purple. In this there is a similarity to <i>Lachesis.</i></p><i>
        </i>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Old scars turn purple, threaten to suppurate, take! on a venous aspect,
        become painful and turn black. Ulcers form at the site of old scars in old syphilitic
        patients and sometimes in psoric patients. Most complaints come on during rest and are
        better by slow motion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another grand feature running through this remedy; it is full of
        discharges, catarrhal discharges, discharges from ulcers, watery discharges from different
        places and even watery stool; and all these discharges are horribly offensive and ichorous.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Deep, flat ulcers from bone and periosteal affections give out a watery,
        bloody discharge that is horribly offensive, with pains shooting outwards. Get the idea of
        the venous stasis well fixed in your mind and with this syphilitic state added to it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are many pains running through the remedy and they are night pains
        like those of syphilis, nightly bone pains, and pains in the periosteum.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The ulcers are deep, with bluish edges. Varicose veins surround the
        ulcers. Inflammation of the bone and periosteum, with blueness all around the ulcers.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When there has been an inflammatory condition of the periosteum, somewhat
        passive in character, the skin adheres to the bone, glues down to it by adhesion. It is too
        feeble to ulcerate, it does not get up a likely inflammation, but only a passive state, The
        glands all over the body are hot and throbbing, with shooting, jerking pains, in syphilis or
        old psoric and scrofulous complaints.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bone pains that are felt in the head are sometimes very distressing.
        Old syphilitic bone pains in the head, stitching, penetrating. It seems where there are
        lumps and nodules, about the head, this medicine seems to burry things. Shooting, stitching,
        tearing pains, under left frontal eminence.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This stitching pain is sometimes described as if a nail or plug were
        driven into the head. These nervous headaches are syphilitic hysterical or scrofulous;
        hysterical pains described as rending, tearing, stitching.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Head</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: All over the
        head there is stitching pain, but in the frontal eminence, in the temples, there is a
        sensation as if a nail or plug were driven in, and most of the pains seem to bore, as if
        they extended from the bone to the surface, and hence are said to be from within out.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It is useful in
        old syphilitics who are subject to eye complaints, ulcers on the eyeball, ulcers on the
        cornea, ameliorated in the open air, with a sensation of numbness in the eyes; inflammation
        of the iris, with ragged appearance of the iris; they are subject also to severe, sharp
        stitching pains that come from within out.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The remedy is full of burning, and so the eyeballs burn, better in the
        open air. Iritis, but the inflammation sometimes involves the choroid, the retina, and
        mucous membrane, making a general inflammatory condition of syphilitic character.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are tearing pains in various places around the eyes; sticking,
        stitching pains, worse at night. Ulcers, with stitching pains, worse at night. Burning.
        stitching in the eyes with dryness, so that the lids stick to the balls of the eyes, pain
        worse at night.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a misty appearance before the eyes, dullness as if looking
        through a fog. It also seems as if the atmosphere were filled with little floating black
        flies.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Muscae volantes."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You have looked into the air and seen little gnats and mosquitoes; well
        it appears to these patients as if these were there when they are not there. The discharge
        from the eyes is ichorous, bloody and often offensive.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This same syphilitic miasm may attack the car and the bones of the car.
        These bones may decay and the hearing be lost.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Burning in the ear with discharge of foetid pus."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Stitching pains in the ears from </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">within out</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Nose</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: A horribly
        offensive discharge comes from the nose; ulcers high up in the nose; caries of the bones of
        the nose; syphilitic ozoena. Putrid old catarrhs.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Feeling as if the nose stopped high up, as if he could not breathe
        through it, with fullness of the head, when riding in a carriage." (Aurum, Aurum mur.)</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Numbness is a great feature of this remedy, numbness of the scalp, or
        deep in the head; numbness here and there; numb, dead feeling associated with the pain;
        numbness after pain; often numbness after sleep.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Other nervous manifestations occur besides those that are hysterical. It
        has choreic motions. You would expect such a peculiar nervous constitution to have almost
        everything among its nervous symptoms.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Constantly chewing and working frothy slime out of mouth, with
        swollen tongue."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Speech unintelligible."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Grinding of teeth; starting at night."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Swelling of the lips, and of the whole buccal mucous membrane, especially
        the lower lip, with burning in the mouth.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are syphilitic symptoms in the throat, attended with the usual
        burning, darting, stitching in ulcers; pain when swallowing; a sensation of a ball rising in
        the throat, such as occurs in globus hystericus; choking, must constantly swallow.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hysterical and choreic affections of the oesophagus and trachea. Spasms
        of the oesophagus. This lump in the throat, or suffocation, is a sort of hysterical spasm of
        the oesophagus.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Dryness and burning in the oesophagus."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Stomach</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In the
        stomach troubles, if you have ever seen a typical case of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Asa foetida</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, you will
        wonder where all the air comes from; it comes up in volumes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Hiccough-like contractions of the diaphragm."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Choreic jerkings of the diaphragm, with expulsion of wind like the sound
        of a pop-gun going off almost every second. It is a condition that the patient has no
        control over; It is like the shooting off of little, guns forcing loud belching, loud
        eructations of wind from the stomach.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are a few symptoms mentioned in the text just here that are worthy
        of note.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pulsation in pit of stomach; perceptible to sight and touch."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pressing, cutting, stitching pains."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A queer observation has been made that flatus was not passed downward,
        but all upwards.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Eructations; smelling like garlic; tasting rancid, sharp or
        putrid."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Always horribly offensive. Offensiveness is a characteristic of the
        remedy. And then there is a</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"gone empty feeling in the pit of the stomach," not a pain.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pulsations after eating."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Meteorism of the stomach."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Abdomen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The remedy
        has many gastric and abdominal complaints; full of bellyache; stitching pains, colic. The
        diarrhoea is more or less troublesome.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These patients are afflicted with diarrhoea from the slightest
        indigestion, after any indiscretion in diet, a painful watery diarrhoea.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Liquid stools of most disgusting smell."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Blackish-brown papescent offensive stools, which relieve."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Genitals</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">:
        "Bearing down in genitals, worse when riding in a carriage."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Uterine ulcer sensitive and painful."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This medicine has been very useful in palliating uterine cancer in such
        constitutions as described those with purple faces, never the very pallid ones.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Women of feeble, flabby, venous constitutions are subject to hemorrhages
        and miscarriages. Women who are not pregnant sometimes have the breasts fill up with milk,
        wonderfully annoying thing, and but few remedies have it; this is one of the few.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has also deficiency of milk.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Ten days after delivery milk diminished."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These patients sometimes get hysterical asthma; all sorts of disturbance
        in breathing, dyspnoea.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Asthmatic feeling in trachea."</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Many of these complaints are worse at night; nightly aggravations.
        Syphilitic complaints are commonly worse at night and such anti syphilitic remedies as </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Mercurius, Staphysagria, Hepar, Nitric acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">etc. are all worse at night.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the other chest complaints, I will read a few of those that are

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is full of rheumatism and gouty symptoms; gouty affections in
        general, in nervous constitutions.</p>
        <p align="justify">When such a nervous constitution finally produces gouty formations, the
        nervousness often disappears; for it has been relieved by the deposit in the joints; a
        transformation scene has taken place.</p>
