        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The general
        features of the remedy are such as relate to the mind and such as relate to the tissues of
        the body in general. If you run through the mental symptoms, taking them all in as one great
        whole, you will see that all the affections, natural to healthy man, are perverted.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So great in extent is this that one of the fundamental loves, which is
        the love of living, of self-protection, is perverted and he loathes life, is weary of life,
        longs to die and seeks methods to commit suicide.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">No love of life. The affections pre-eminently are deranged, the
        intellectual sphere is only secondarily changed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course insanity runs through the remedy, but it is an insanity that
        begins in the will and proceeds to the intellect; it is first observed as a perversion of
        the affections.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is astonishing that one could get into such a state of mind, such
        horrible depression of spirits that there is an absolute loss of enjoyment in everything.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You take away a man's hope, and he has nothing to live for, he then wants
        to die. Such, it seems, is the state in this medicine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Self-condemnation, continual self-reproach, self-criticism, a constant
        looking into self; she does nothing right, everything is wrong, nothing will succeed,
        hopelessness.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Imagines he cannot succeed in anything, and he does everything
        wrong; he is in disunion with himself."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Imagines he sees obstacles in his way everywhere.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is all the time imaging that he has <i>neglected something, that he

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He imagines that he deserves reproach in consequence of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">having neglected duty</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">;</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> he has
        neglected something, he is wrong, is wholly evil, has sinned away his day of grace, is not
        worthy of salvation; this is the train of thought that constantly runs through his mind.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The thought really becomes uncontrollable; he is absorbed in himself and
        sits and broods over it, and by brooding over it he only intensifies his present state and
        hatches new grievances, continues to worry over himself, thinks he is wholly unfit for this
        world, and then he longs to die.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He looks on the dark side of everything, constantly expecting bad news,
        looking for everything to go wrong. The future looks dark to him, and he wants to die; he
        never will succeed, for everything goes wrong that he turns his hand to.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">His business is dark, his family troubles him, his friends annoy him; he

        vexation. The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aurum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> state of mind is an insanity dreadful to look upon
        because of its turbulence and melancholy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is suitable in the most profound states of melancholy and depression
        where the patient sits silent and says nothing. When disturbed he is aroused to great
        vehemence, anger and violence.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Melancholy, feels hateful and quarrelsome."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Terrible melancholy after abuse of <i>Mercury."</i></p><i>
        </i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The causes of this state of insanity are prolonged anxiety, unusual
        responsibility, syphilis and loss of property.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Persons who have been repeatedly drugged with </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Mercury</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">have established
        upon themselves a mercurial disease, with enlargement of the liver, and this is almost
        always attended more or less by melancholy and sadness and such hopelessness as we find in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aurum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aurum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> produces such
        affections of the liver as are associated with cardiac affections, endocarditis, dropsy of
        the heart and rheumatic affections that have gone to the heart.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You will notice that wherever the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">affections</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">are pre-eminently disturbed in mental, disease that
        there is either cardiac weakness, endocarditis, enlargement of the heart, or some organic or
        functional disease of the heart.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You will very often find a history of taking </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Mercury</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">that has superinduced a rheumatic state that has been
        rubbed away with liniments until the heart is affected, and with this comes hopelessness,
        insanity of the will, disturbance of the affections.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Then it appears to spread in this remedy from the will to the
        understanding, and the intellectual portion of man becomes involved. Think what a state it
        is for a man who has been in good condition of health, respected in his business circles, to
        have a desire to commit suicide.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will see other kinds of insanity and a breaking down or a state of
        feebleness of the intellect, he cannot think nor reason; his affections are practically
        intact, but he finally goes into a state of imbecility, or he becomes wild and commits
        suicide from impulse.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is an instance where the intellect has been affected first and
        spread to the will. Sometimes this state comes on, and no disturbance in the man's
        intellectual nature has been observed; it is intact, it is sound.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He has been sound in his business affairs, he has been a good father, he
        has been observed by those around him to be intelligent, but he has silently brooded over
        his state and his hatred of the world; he has told nobody of it, and then, he has been found
        hung in his room.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The man's intellectual nature keeps the man in contact with the world;
        but his affections are largely kept to himself. A man can have affection for all sorts of
        things and perversion of the affections, but his intellect will guide him not to show his
        likes and dislikes to the world.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The affections cannot be seen, but man's intellect is subject to
        inspection. He cannot conceal his intellect. We shall see that the affections are interior,
        they are covered with a cloak, they are his innermost and are hidden from inspection; but
        the understanding is the outermost garment, it surrounds and hides his affections, just as
        does the garment he wears over the body hide the body. The affections that Aurum resembles
        are those like unto the very innermost nature of man.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Ailments from grief, disappointed love, fright, anger,
        contradiction, mortification."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pain makes her desperate so that she would like to jump out of the
        window."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He meditates upon death, upon suicide; he wants to get out of the world,
        wants to destroy himself, has no love for his life which he thinks is worthless.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bones and articulations</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        The remedy is full of rheumatic affections, not unlike such as are found in old mercurial
        cases; rheumatic affections with swelling of the joints; affections of the cartilages and
        bone, inflammation of the periosteum; thickening and induration of the periosteum.
        Indurations of glands; induration of the cartilages about the joints.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These are all of syphilitic and mercurial character. It is useful in old
        syphilitics when the bones are breaking down in any part of the body; the shin bones, nose
        bones, ear bones, any of the small bones.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Like syphilis
        and mercury, the complaints are aggravated at night, coming on in the evening and keep up
        all night. The pains are violent, they tear, the bones ache as if they would break, not in
        acute fevers but in old syphilitic bone troubles.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Knife-like pains in the periosteum. Pains in the joints rendering them
        immovable. Inflammation of the bone itself with caries.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is not strange that the vascular coating of the bones, the periosteum,
        should be greatly affected because there is a strange vascularity, all over the economy, in
        this medicine.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Veins</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The veins are
        enlarged, in a state of congestion and inflammation, and friable. The veins become thickened
        and tumefied. The blood vessels pulsate all over the body.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Erethism or vascular fullness characterizes nearly all
        complaints."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Fullness of the veins of the extremities; this goes on until swelling
        appears with weakness <i>so </i>that dropsy <i>is </i>prevalent throughout the remedy.
        Oedema <i>of </i>the extremities, with pitting upon pressure, which occurs in heart and
        liver affections.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A false state of plethora seems to<i> </i>exist in the body and finally
        turmoil and excitement occur. Violent orgasms in the body, sometimes demonstrated as violent
        heat, coming in flushes with excitement. Fidgetiness, feeling as if something dreadful were
        going to happen throughout the economy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Then it settles into a state of quiescence for awhile and then this
        repeats itself. These violent orgasms come preparatory to the localization or establishment
        of some breakdown in the economy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">At times it is a cardiac affection, with marked oppression behind the
        sternum with dyspnoea on walking fast for going upstairs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Endocarditis will have this turmoil in the body; by and by, look for
        albumin in the urine, look for enlargement of the liver, look for signs of cancer of the
        uterus, and deep-seated affections.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Boring in bones."</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains drive the patient out of bed at night and make him walk. This
        is seen in old syphilitic bone pains, and old mercurialized patients.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many symptoms disappear after washing, especially cold washing; but
        whenever the patient is suffering from great excitement, turmoil and vascularity,
        constitutional orgasm, pulsations, he wants the doors and windows open, wants to get out in
        the cool air; wants the clothing thrown off.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This state of excitement and pulsation is ameliorated by the open air. It
        has those flushes of heat so, common to women at the critical period, and these are followed
        by sweat, sometimes by chilliness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Most that we have said of the remedy is about its general aspect, for
        everything about the mind is general.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">

        sensation as if air were blowing upon him; he looks around to see where the draft comes from
        when there is none; extremely sensitive.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        deal of congestion and rush of blood to the head. The head is sore and feels bruised.
        Stitching, burning, tearing pains in the head; much throbbing in the head. The face is
        bloated, flushed and shiny with the congestive headaches.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These headaches are often found in syphilitic subjects; often associated
        with cardiac disease. Pain in the back of the head associated with cardiac disease, with
        sluggish circulation, purple face, duskiness of the skin. Exostoses as in syphilis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The skull bones are sensitive to touch; the periosteum is tender to
        touch. In old mercurialized cases with bone affections and necrosis of the skull, as in
