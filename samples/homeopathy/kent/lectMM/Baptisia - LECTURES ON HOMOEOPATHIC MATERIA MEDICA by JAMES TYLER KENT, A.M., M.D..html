        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is suitable for acute diseases. It is principally a short-acting medicine,
        suitable for complaints that are not long lasting. So far as we know it is not an
        antipsoric, does not go deep into the life.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All of its acute diseases and complaints have the appearance of Zymosis,
        like scarlet fever, diphtheria, typhoid, and gangrenous complaints. There is one thing that
        is unusual about it, it brings on this septic state more, rapidly than most other remedies.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The zymotic complaints of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars., Phos., Rhus, and Bry</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.,
        are much slower in their pace. But </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is suitable for typhoids that come on rapidly, and
        hence it is not so often suitable in idiopathic typhoids.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When an individual comes down suddenly from cold, from malaria, from
        drinking poisonous waters, and from any zymotic or septic cause he is hurled into bed in a
        few days, instead of going through a period of four, five or six weeks. The old idiopathic
        typhoid fevers come on slower.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is suitable
        for those blood poisons that are highly septic such as the puerperal state, such as scarlet
        fever. He comes down perhaps with the appearance of a sudden violent break down, with a
        remittent fever.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But all at once it turns continued, and takes on septic symptoms. So much
        for its progress and its pace. Every medicine must be observed as to its velocity, as to its
        pace, as to its periodicity, as to its motion, and its wave.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Looking and smelling</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        We get that by looking at the symptoms. You take an individual who has been down in a mine,
        in the swam, down in the mud, in the sewers, who has inhaled foul gases, who goes into bed
        with a sort of stupor, from the very beginning he feels stupid. It is not gradual, but he
        goes down very suddenly, and he is stupid.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is prostrated. His face is mottled. Sordes begin to appear on the
        teeth much earlier than in the regular typhoid. The abdomen becomes distended much earlier
        than in a regular typhoid; that is one who is accustomed to observing those things knows
        they are postponed for a number of days; while with this remedy the third day the abdomen is
        distended, his mouth is bleeding, and is putrid.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">His odors are horrible; and he is in a marked state of delirium, such as
        would not be expected until the typhoid is out for many days. So it has rapid running
        diseases. It has velocity.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is, he is going down toward death rapidly. He is increasing in his
        prostration more rapidly than usual. It is not a gradual decline of days and weeks.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He goes into a state of stupor. When aroused he takes on delirium. It
        does not matter whether it is scarlet fever, or typhoid fever, or a septic surgical fever,
        or a puerperal fever, or what.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He has fever, and if you look at him, and talk to him, and turn him over,
        and rouse him up, and make him realize that you want to say something to him - which is
        difficult - he gives you the impression that he has been on a big drunk.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That is the first thought you will have in a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> case.
        His countenance is besotted. It is bloated and purple and mottled. Blood oozes from the
        mouth. You have seen the besotted countenance of drunkards, and it is like an old drunkard.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: His mind seems
        to be gone. He does not know what be is talking about lie is in confusion, and when aroused
        be attempts to say some thing, and utters a word or two and it all flits away, and he is
        back in his state of stupor again.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">No matter what disease that comes in, no matter what inflammation is
        present, no matter what organ is inflammed, if that state of the blood that can give rise to
        such symptoms and such sepsis is present, if that state of the mind is present, it is </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Discharges</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: All of the
        discharges are putrid. The odor is cadaverous, pungent; penetrating. His perspiration, if he
        has any, is sour, foetid, pungent, and penetrating.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If he has no sweat the body gives off an odor that is unaccountable. The
        odor is so penetrating that on going into the front door the whole house, if the room is
        open, is filled with the odor. The odor from the stool is putrid and so penetrating that it
        can be detected on first going into the house.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, a strange thing that runs through the remedy is a peculiar kind of
        mental confusion, in which he is in a constant argument with his parts.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Delirium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: He seems to
        feel that there are two of him. He realizes a dual existence whenever he is roused up. He
        will begin talking about the other one in bed with him.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is said clinically that</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"his great toe is in controversy with his thumb."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Or, "one leg is talking to the other leg."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Or, one part is talking to another part; or, he is scattered around over
        the bed; tumbles and you ask him what he is trying to do.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"why, I am trying to get those pieces together."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He never succeeds; he is in delirium, Of course these are only examples;
        you will get a new phase every time you get a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> case.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Most of the time he is un conscious except when roused. Sometimes
        mutters. You will see his lips go, and you rouse him to see what he is about, and he is
        trying to get the pieces together.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Confused as if intoxicated."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are stages when he is not quite so stupid, and he is sleepless and
        restless. That is the exception. Most, generally you will find him lying upon one side
        curled up like a dog, and he does not want to be disturbed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, when the stupor is not so great he is restless and turns and
        tosses. In that case he cannot sleep, because he cannot get the pieces together. He feels if
        he could once get matters together he could go to sleep, and these parts that are talking to
        each other keep him awake. His mind wanders as soon as his eyes are closed. Dullness,
        especially at night. Indisposition to think. Mind seems weak.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There you find the whole picture of the mental aspect in all complaints,
        in all acute diseases but they all come on in a hurry.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They are zymotic, of a low form such as scarlet fever, such as malignant
        diseases; and yet it takes on a continued type of fever.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These patients will die in from ten to twelve days if let alone. Whereas,
        ordinary typhoid will run for weeks, and sometimes die at the close of four weeks in a
        crisis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bleedings are black and offensive. The putridity is marked. In the
        mouth, the mucus from the throat and nose is bloody and putrid. It has a diarrhoea.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Stools</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Thin, faecal,
        watery, yellow. It has a typical typhoid discharge; the most typical typhoid stool is like
        yellow corn-meal mush, coming on many times a day, but soft, pappy, just about the
        consistency of soft mush.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This remedy has that stool, but it is not the commonest form - but the
        black, the brown, the dark. In treating a good many cases of typhoid it was my fortune to
        observe a large number of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> cases, which the remedy cured promptly.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The stool where the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> did the most service was like ground up slate, slate
        colored, brownish. The odor was penetrating. In addition to that I have seen this medicine
        cure that kind of diarrhoea when it was slate colored, even thin as water, if it was
        horribly putrid like decomposed meat; like the cadaver, attended with great prostration.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I have seen it cure that diarrhoea when there were none of the elements
        of typhoid fever present a simple prostrating form of diarrhoea.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Exhaustion</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Exhaustion
        comes rapidly. In three days he has a deathly sinking coming over him.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Headaches</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        headaches are nondescript. Only those congestive attacks, frontal headaches - violent pains
        in the head, and especially in the occiput, such as occur in the low forms of disease.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">I hardly ever go into the details of headaches. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is not
        a headache remedy. It is not a remedy that we would single out to treat headaches with,
        except such violent pains in the head of a congestive character that are associated with
        this low form of fever.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It has
        characteristic eye symptoms. Congestion. Redness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Pains in the eyes, and back of the eyes. So it has with hearing. So it
        has with nasal symptoms. But associated with fevers. But as soon as we come to the face we
        begin to realize the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baptisia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> symptoms, that besotted expression.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The countenance shows that. The eyes show it, the face shows it. And
        these are the symptoms:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Dark red with besotted appearance. Hot and perceptibly flushed;
        dusky."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That tells the whole story. Burning; beat in the face.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Critical sweat on forehead and face. Anxious, frightened
        look."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">On rousing from sleep looks as if he had a horrible dream.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">And then comes the mouth, and the teeth, and the throat, and the tongue,

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The tongue is swollen, painful, offensive. Covered with black blood. Raw;
        denuded. Stiff and dry as leather. Described as if it was made of wood, or burnt leather;
        ulcerated. Ulceration runs all through the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Aphthous patches. These little ulcers that start no bigger than a
        pin-head become black and are so offensive and run together so that the whole surface of the
        mouth will be in a state of ulceration; raw and denuded, oozing a thick saliva that is
        putrid.</p>

        have another phase of it. From the sore throat the trouble extends into the oesophagus, and
        the oesophagus is at first in a state of spasm. Later it is paralyzed. Fluids will at first
        go down the throat, but he cannot swallow a particle of solids.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bolus of food will go into the upper end of the oesophagus and there
        it chokes him and feels like a lump, and he chokes and struggles and gags and throws it
        back, and then takes water or fluids.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He can swallow fluids but he cannot swallow solids. Every particle of
        solid food gags; but he can swallow liquids. Natr. mur. and quite a number of other remedies
        have spasms of the oesophagus coming on with nervous complaints, but in this low state I
        know of no other medicine having that one symptom, having these features, and the paralysis,
        and the spasmodic condition of the oesophagus.</p>
