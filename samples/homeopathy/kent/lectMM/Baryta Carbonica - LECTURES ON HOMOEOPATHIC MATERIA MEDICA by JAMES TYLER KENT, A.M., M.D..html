        late learning how to walk, even with pretty good limbs. Calc<i>. </i>has miserable, weakly

        medicines have a peculiar kind of tardiness in the development of the brain, so that they
        are late learning to do things; late in developing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. leads them all in this late coming into the
        activities and uses of life.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will have patients to treat, where this slow development manifests
        itself in girls. 18 to 25 years of age, who do the things they did when they were children,
        and say things as they said them when they were children.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Childish manner of doing things, and childish behavior. Playing
        with dolls and saying foolish things."</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">They have not come into womanhood. They are late in taking on the
        activities and uses of the woman. They lack the prudence of the woman. They have not become
        circumspect, and say things just as a boy or just as a little girl would say them.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That is the dwarfishness of the mind. To appreciate that late
        development, and to see it in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. from all of its symptoms and peculiar features,
        leads to a strong grasp of the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is some of this found in such remedies as </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Graph., Sulph. and Calc</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., but nothing compared to this remedy. This seems to suspend the
        development that makes the child into a man or a woman.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is not a small person that makes me think of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.,
        but the dwarfishness that is mental, and that is of organs.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Organs, as it were, become paralyzed, or one organ does not develop. It
        stops, and the others go on. That would make me think of this remedy. A single organ fails
        to mature, and the others go on; one-sidedness, a partiality of development.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Lymphatic glands</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        next grand feature of this remedy is its affinity for the lymphatic glands all over the
        body. The glands all over the body enlarge and indurate; the glands of the neck, the glands
        of the groin, the lymphatics in the abdomen are all affected-knotty chains form in the neck.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With a few other things that we will put together shortly we will see in
        this patient a peculiar figure. It has emaciation-gradual dwindling in persons who have been
        fat, who have been well nourished.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It has an enlarged abdomen. It has been found suitable in marasmus, for
        children with enlarged glands, enlarged abdomen; emaciation of the tissues, emaciated limbs
        and dwarfishness of mind, and you have there all the whole </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        marasmus.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient himself is chilly; sensitive to cold; wants to be well
        wrapped. Marked weakness with feeble pulse is a strong feature and he must lie down; he is
        worse standing and sitting.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The weakness is worse after eating. His pains are better from motion and
        in the open air. His complaints are aggravated by cold. The enlarged glands take on
        tenderness and congestion from being exposed. The tonsils gradually increase. The glands of
        the neck increase in size, and in hardness, from every cold and from becoming chilled.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Swelling and induration of glands. Inflammation of glands with
        infiltration."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Infiltration belongs to the remedy. The glands become harder and harder.
        Ulcers become indurated in their base. Open sur faces become indurated in their walls.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When a child has almost any disease, measles, scarlet fever, mumps, or
        even a bad cold, or a malarial attack, the development ceases and dwarfishness results, a
        state in which he was not born, but a state that he has acquired, arrest of development.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It brings on emaciation and dwindling of the whole body, except the
        abdomen, which gradually enlarges. These are phases not to be overlooked in the very
        beginning, because the symptoms only help to establish this basis and these troubles and
        tissue changes come on as ultimates.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another grand feature in this remedy is the application of these things
        to more advanced years. We say this is a childhood state, this is the state of youth and
        arrested development.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now it does not matter whether we have this arrested development in
        youth, in childhood, or at the advanced age of fifty. From some strange circumstance which
        we are not able to fathom we say the individual is taking on the, appearance of old age.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Premature old age</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: We
        call it premature old age. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has cured lingering complaints that have resulted
        from malaria, overwork, mental or physical, prolonged mental strain, when the appearance of
        premature old age was a prominent feature.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Old age creeps upon him too soon. There is but little difference between
        childhood and old age, and hence old age is called second childhood; but we always regret to
        see a man under seventy becoming childish, and yet we do see many becoming simple and
        childish. It does not mean merely imbecility, but childlike behavior.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Doing and saying things like a child. So in premature old age these
        symptoms lead us to think of Baryta carb.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has cured
        fatty tumors, encysted tumors, lupus, outward growths of tuberculous character, sarcoma; and
        it has mitigated the pains and sufferings and has prolonged life in cancerous affections.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Mentally it is
        worthy of careful study, and we will see cropping out in the mental symptoms all of the
        phases intermingled with tissue changes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. child will be seen hiding behind the furniture when
        strangers come in; will hide as for shame of something or as if afraid. It imagines all
        sorts of strange things, that it is talked about, or laughed at.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It does not seem to advance. It does not seem to do any good to teach it,
        for it does the same things over and over and remains untrained. They either cannot
        comprehend, or they can not memorize, or they cannot maintain a thought, and you go over it
        and over it, and the mother wonders if that child is ever going to learn something, and the
        teacher reports that the child lacks capacity.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The teacher cannot comprehend it, the mother cannot comprehend it, but
        the homoeopathic physician should know all about it at once. If he knows his Materia Medica
        he should be well up in the development of a feeble child; those who are going towards
        rickets, who are feeble, who are always depending on somebody, fitted only for menial
        places.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The homeopathic physician does well when he trots the little Johnnies and
        the little Susies on his knee and takes a good fair observation of their ability, and of
        what they lack, and understands how to build up what is lacking. Is not that in itself worth
        working for?</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It requires all of the potencies that have ever been made to master
        constitutions. Some will require medium potencies, some very low, some very high. Let us not
        deprive our little ones of anything they need. Only so we look forward to the highest use,
        to develop them into their fullest capacity.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is an expression here in the text,</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">"</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Want of clear

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Do we not see from what I have said, what that must mean in this remedy,
        and that it is different in this remedy from what it is in a good many others?</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">And yet if you had read that symptom first you would not have appreciated
        it.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        mind that we know to be dizziness. But he is not clear in his intellect. We see how this
        medicine takes hold of the intellect. It takes hold of his memory. It begins with a feeble
        state, and it gradually travels toward imbecility.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You press it to its extreme and it has imbecility, and up to this we have
        degrees all along the line from the very beginning, from a mere matter of cloudiness in his
        thoughts to imbecility.</p>

        gives the constitutional medicine, and they often disappear after a while, and then the
        patient thinks the doctor has done a wonderful thing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He gets more glory and more credit for curing a wart than he does for
        curing the patient. The doctor who prescribes correctly turns the vital state into order.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He cures the patient, and the patient, being in a state of order,
        commences to repair his body, and the tissues go through a general house cleaning and such
        things as are not needed are dispensed with; and the physician is considered a wonderful
        man.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So this remedy cures tumors and warts. Warts upon the limbs, and upon the
        back, and upon the hands.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains are of a gouty, rheumatic character, worse from becoming cold
        and from cold weather. Paralytic weakness and trembling and numbness of the feet.</p>
        <p align="justify">Offensive perspiration of the feet which causes soreness of the soles,
        ulcers on the feet, checked foot sweat. Trembling of the feet while standing and tottering
        while walking. Tearing, drawing pains in lower limbs. Sudden sharp pains in knees.</p>
