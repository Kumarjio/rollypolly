        down; all motion creates violent pains; feels as if the head would burst, as if the eyes

        standing, or stooping. It feels as if the brain would fall out or push forward.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This in creases the headache so much that it sometimes turns into
        knife-like, or hammering pains. These are the expressions used.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensation of nails and hammers, jagging and tearing; but with all,
        pressure and throbbing. When rising from a seat these sensations are all intensified.
        Throbbing pulsation, like hammers hitting the inside of the sore skull, described by
        patients as if the inside of the skull was one continuous sore and was being pecked by
        hammers with every pulsation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Some times it will settle down while sitting still, or while lying; but

        <p align="JUSTIFY">All these headaches are relieved by pressure upon the outside. Sudden

        bear carefully upon the head will ameliorate, like the pressure of a bandage, or a
        tight-fitting cap.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, all of these headaches are brought on by exposure to the cold air;
        from standing in the cold air with the head uncovered. Sometimes a severe headache will come
        on from merely having the hair cut. Congestion of the head lasts for days, with throbbing
        and pulsating; from having the hair cut.</p>
