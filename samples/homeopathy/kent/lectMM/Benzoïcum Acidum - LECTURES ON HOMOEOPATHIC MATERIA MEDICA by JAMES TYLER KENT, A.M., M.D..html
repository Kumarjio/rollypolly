        <p align="JUSTIFY">They simply call up in a single individual something that the individual
        has, and that something belongs to the human race, and so whenever we see a diseased state
        in the remedy we know that it exists in correspondence to something in the human race.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Things are so adjusted that everything is for use. There may be
        conditions in the human race that we, as yet, know no remedy for.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We see certain groups of peculiar symptoms frequently repeat themselves
        and we know they are representatives of a state of the economy, but up to this day we may

        Now this remedy has a<i> </i>state and condition that is sometimes called the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">gouty</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> constitution, the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">uraemic</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> or the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">lithaemic</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> constitution,
        and, these cases are very difficult to manage, as the state is so persistent. It is one of
        the manifestations of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Psora</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Urines</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: These patients
        suffer more or less from irregularity in the action of the kidneys; sometimes the urine is
        scanty and then they suffer from bodily complaints; again the urine is copious and then they
        are relieved of their complaints.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They are subject to rheumatic attacks and pains in the joints, showing
        the gouty constitution, and then they have relief when the urine is copious<i> </i>and
        heavily laden with deposits; but on<i> </i>comes an attack when they have more or less
        urine, but it is light in specific gravity, and then they are full of pains; in that way
        they fluctuate.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, the young prescriber will sometimes see the patient when he is
        passing large quantities of uric acid forming the red pepper deposits and he thinks he must
        stop that; his main idea is to check that one particular thing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the patient is a great deal better off while he has it. To cheek it
        is like suppressing a skin eruption, or restraining any other manifestation of disease.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It will be noticed, as one of the foremost things in this remedy's
        manifestations, that it has strong smelling urine; the urine is pungent, and it sometimes
        becomes so strong that it smells like, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hippuricum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, and so it is said </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">urine smells strong like that of a horse.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        are changeable; when the urine is copious and plenty of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">uric</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> acid is being
        passed, and the urine is full of deposits, then the patient is at his best; when the urine
        is scanty or of light specific gravity he suffers from backache and pains in the joints, he
        suffers from atmospheric changes, is sensitive to cold drafts and to the air; but let the
        urine start up again, which it does in a sort of alternating way, light urine alternating
        with heavy urine, and the patient is comfortable again.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Then, there are complaints in which the urine smells strong and pungent;
        this often occurs in children. It is astonishing that these little ones manifest the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">uric</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        acid diathesis in early life.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Children</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Mothers
        often describe it as intensely urinous. It smells like intensified urine; it is not the
        smell, so much, of decomposed urine nor of<i> </i>foetid urine, but urine intensified.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has cured many times wetting the bed involuntary urination in sleep,
        when the bed that has been wetted several times becomes uncleanable.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You can smell it almost as quick as you go into the room; the children
        all, smell like urine, strong urine; the house smells like urine. If two or three of these
        little fellows wet the bed at night, the urine is so strong it tells the story at once.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This medicine needs reproving; details have not been brought ou yet in
        nature is known. We have a good many medicines having this nature, but this is perhaps as
        intense as any.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy does not. of course, fit all these patients, because it does
        not fit their special symptoms; but it has the nature or general state which, of course,
        precedes everything, and when it relates to all the particulars as well it does make
        wonderful changes.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There are a few

        the period of wakefulness, he dwells, during the night, upon all the unpleasant subjects
        that he can think of.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This state alternates with nights of stupid sleep for weeks, and this
        fluctuates, in accordance with the fluctuation of the state of urine.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headaches are very numerous; the remedy is full of dull, aching

        time in the joints, and they are passing but little urine.</p>

        acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> for the stomach symptoms, it is
        important that we have in mind its whole nature, how it brings about its complaints and what

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Its striking ones I will call your attention to, but remember its

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The white stool, like soap-suds, is so strong a symptom that the remedy

        <p align="JUSTIFY">So we get the idea that the stools are white and that the first passages

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is well, often, when a stool is passed that is of a light liquid, to
        bear in mind a few remedies that produce this state and ascertain whether it is like
