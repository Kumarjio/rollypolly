        have finished the study of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Berberis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> we will see that it is not a very extensive remedy,
        but it is a very important one.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Benzoic acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">it fits into the gouty and rheumatic sphere. It corresponds to such gouty
        conditions as do not determine to their proper places.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A low state of the economy is present; anaemic condition; feeble
        constitution; pallid and sickly, old and worn out; prematurely old and wrinkled men and
        women.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They are too feeble to determine the gouty deposits to the finger joints,
        where they naturally belong, and the trouble is yet, as it were, wandering around through
        the economy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Wandering pains in the nerves, and nerve sheaths. The wandering,
        stitching, tearing, twinging pains that run through </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Berberis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> are found in old
        gouty constitutions, and that is where we get the greatest benefit from </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Berberis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        proving would lead us to see it is similar to the wandering, twinging and tearing pains of
        old gouty constitutions, in persons who are pallid, and sickly, and chilly, where the
        deposits have not been so marked in the joints; but where the twinging in the fingers and in
        the toes are just such as are found - where the deposits do exist.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course in all of the gouty states we must look to the liver and
        kidneys for pains and various distresses; they are centers of observation, because these
        organs are more or less disturbed. And very often cardiac troubles go along with them.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The kidneys, liver, and heart are more or less disturbed in their
        functions and we see that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Berberis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> takes hold of these organs. We have the uraemic
        state, and the state of disorder that ends in these conditions. We will have twinging pains
        along with kidney disturbances.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Irregularities of the urine. Copious discharges, alternating with scanty
        discharges. Light urine, and heavy urine, excessive deposits of uric acid and urates.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is changeable, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Benzoic acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These two remedies run very much together, yet their
        symptoms are wholly unlike. We find among these sensations that stitching pains are found in
        almost every region of the body, and they are all the time changing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Wandering and stitching pains; little twinges. As you sit by his side and

        <p align="JUSTIFY">If you single them out in places, in a given joint, from that one joint
        they will radiate in every direction. If it is the knee joint, they will go up; and down,

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The head comes in for its share of these wander ing, pains. Stitching,
