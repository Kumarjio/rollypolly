        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is one underlying feature of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bromium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> conditions, they
        are found especially in those individuals that are made sick from being heated.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It there is a diphtheria epidemic and the mother bundles up her baby
        until she overheats it, and keeps it in a hot room, and it happens to be a child that is
        sensitive to being wrapped up, and one whose complaints are worse from being wrapped up,
        look out.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You are going to have a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bromium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> diphtheria. It is
        indicated also in complaints that come on in the night after a very hot day in the summer.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Now, this is as near as you can come to being routine in croup and
        diphtheria. If the mother has the baby out in a dreadfully cold, dry day, and along towards
        midnight it wakens with spasmodic croup, you know that it is more likely to call for </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">than any other

        that baby has been overheated, with too much clothing, and it is a plethoric child, and
        towards midnight you are called up, and the child has a red face, and your examinations
        reveal a membrane in the throat, we will see as we study the remedy that this may be a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bromium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> case.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Hoarseness coming on from getting overheated."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Loss of voice coming on from getting overheated. A turmoil in the whole
        economy; with headaches, coming on from getting overheated. That runs through </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bromium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. So it is in the hot weather, and being confined to a hot room, and after
        going from the cold into the heat.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But after the complaint comes on, no matter where it is, he is so
        sensitive to cold that a draft of cool air freezes him; but he cannot be overheated without
        suffering.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Glands</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Bromium has
        running through it a tendency to infiltrate the glands. The glands become bard, but seldom
        suppurate. They generally remain hard. The glands of the neck, the parotid, the sublingual,
        the submaxillary, are enormously enlarged and very hard.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The processes of inflammation are slow; they are not that rapid, violent
        kind like we find in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bell</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. and </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Merc</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Parts that inflame infiltrate, becoming hard."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Inflammation with hardness is the idea. It has been very useful in ulcers
        with this infiltration; very useful in enlarged glands with great hardness, without any
        tendency to suppurate.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Glands take on tuberculosis, and tissues take on tuberculosis. Glands
        that inflame for a while begin to take on a lower form of degeneration, a lower form of
        tissue making.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is very similar to these enlarged, hard, scrofulous glands that we
        find in the neck; enlargement of the parotid and submaxillary. It has cured enlargement and
        great hardness of the thyroid gland.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, we have emaciation, and when we see the tendency to infiltration
        it is not strange that it has been a curative medicine in cancer and tuberculosis. There is
        weakness in this remedy. The legs become weak. Growing prostration, with tremulous limbs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Twitching; tremulous weakness; fainting. In the catarrhal affections
        there is a formation, more or less, of membrane.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Membranous exudate is a natural course of events. A natural feature of
        the mucous membrane is infiltration, so that the mucous membrane appears to exude little
        grayish-white vegetations, and beneath them is induration.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is true in ulcers, it is true in mucous membrane. And ulcer will
        form upon the mucous membrane and eat in, and build beneath it a hardened stratum of tissue.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has febrile conditions along with these catarrhal states. Great
        nervous excitement.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Croupy manifestations. Running through most of the complaints there is
        palpitation.</p>

        nausea, palpitation with headache, palpitation with various kinds of nervous excitement. So

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Scraping and rawness in the larynx. Scraping mucus from the larynx,
        scraping and coughing. It is not a hawk, because that noise clears the throat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Every medical should go through all the noises he hears others make, and
        try and observe as much as possible what feeling is accompanied with that noise, so that he
        can put himself in the other's place.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Each one is accompanied with its own sound, and the instant you hear it
        you realize the exact place he is drawing mucus from and just where the irritation is.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If you allow the patient to describe it he always calls it by the wrong
        name. The patient knows very little about this part except that it is the throat, and if he
        is drawing mucus from the throat, or scraping it from the larynx, he always calls it the
        throat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the physician must waive all that and observe as to sound. So let
        each one go alone by himself and make all these noises that he bears people make, and then
        realize for himself what part it is he is scraping.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It may seem ludicrous, but how else will you learn about it? It is just
        as important to figure out these sounds as it is to figure out what a child needs by its
        sounds and motions. It is impossible to get the symptoms and wants of a child except by
        interpreting its motions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Every motion it makes indicates something. An astute observer, one who
        has been watching children for a number of years, will understand the child, and will hardly
        have to ask the mother a question. He will know at once where the child is sick by what it
        does.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The child is like the animal. You never have to ask a horse or dog where
        he feels pain, because he will always tell by his motions. So does the infant.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The hoarseness comes on after being overheated. Remember that.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">You cannot individualize a remedy by these because one child will croup
        in one pitch, and another will croup in another; but to get at the constitution of the child
