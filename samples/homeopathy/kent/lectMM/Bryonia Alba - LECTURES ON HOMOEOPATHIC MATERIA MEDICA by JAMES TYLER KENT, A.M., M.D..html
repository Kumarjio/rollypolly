        remittence or intermittence.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The symptoms of some remedies come on suddenly, with great violence, with
        great rapidity, stay but a short time in their paroxysm, and go off as it nothing had

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has inflammatory conditions anywhere about the body, but particularly
        of the fibrous tissues, serous membranes, ligaments of joints and aponeuroses. It also
        affects the coating of nerves with its congestions, and these gradually increase in
        severity.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">From the beginning there are present the characteristic features, and it
        may be seen that this patient is coming down with a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bryonia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> sickness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient has several days of preparation. He does not feel very well,
        is languid and tired, does not want to be spoken to, does not want to move, and this
        gradually increases; pains begin to flit over the body, they move around here and there over
        the fibres in one place and another, and every time he moves the pain increase, until they
        end in a steady and continuous pain. The parts become hot and inflamed, and at last he is
        down with rheumatism.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The complaints come on </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">after taking cold</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">not the first few hours, as in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aconite </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">or <i>Bell</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>., </i>but
        the day after an exposure he begins to feel uneasy and he sneezes and the nose discharges,
        there is rawness in the chest, and in a day or so he has a chill and comes down with some
        inflammatory trouble, pneumonia or pleurisy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Its inflammatory complaints include inflammation of the membranes of the
        brain, sometimes extending, into the cord; the pleural membranes, the peritoneum and the
        heart covering, these are the most common; it also has inflammation of organs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When these conditions come on there is noticed, very early in the case,
        even before the pains begin, an aversion to motion, and the patient does not know why, but
        finally he observes that his symptoms are made worse if he has to move, so that the
        slightest inclination to move is resisted with a feeling of anger, and when he does move he
        finds he is aroused to great suffering, and that all the aches and pains of the body come
        on.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Thus we have the well-known </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bryonia <i>aggravation from motion</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>. </i>This<i> </i>runs all through the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This medicine is suitable in a great many diseases, diseases of a </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">typhoid nature</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">diseases that take
        on a symptomatic typhoid, diseases that start out as remittents and run into a continued
        fever, as in pneumonia, pleurisy, inflammation of the liver, of glands, of the bowels, etc.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It may be a gastro-enteritis or peritonitis, or inflammation of the
        bowels, with the sensitiveness, the aggravation from motion and the desire to keep perfectly
        still. Inflammation of joints, whether of rheumatic character or not, whether from cold,
        exposure or injury.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is an extreme state of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">irritability</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">in Bryonia; every word which compels him to answer a
        question or to think will aggravate him.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The effort to talk will be attended with horror. At the beginning of
        complaints you go to the bedside of a patient who has been grumbling a few days; something
        is evidently coming on; the family meet you at the door and say,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"The patient is almost unconscious;"</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">you look at him, the face is puffed and purplish, he seems to be dazed,
        there appears to be a short of venous stasis all over the body, but especially about the
        face; his countenance is almost that of an imbecile, yet he is perfectly capable of talking,
        although he has an aversion to it and appears to outsiders to ignore everything that is
        said.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This sometimes comes on apparently in a short time; the patient awakens
        in the morning with a dull, congestive headache and a stupid feeling in the head; dulness of
        mind so that he cannot work, and this feeling gradually increases; such a state is sometimes
        the forerunner of a serious illness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We find, when a pneumonia or inflammation of the liver, or some slow
        insidious inflammation is coming on somewhere in the body, but not yet located, that this
        state will begin in the morning.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This is peculiar about the aggravation of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bryonia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> - its
        troubles commence many times early in the morning. On waking, with the first move, he
        realizes that things are not all right, there is a state of stupidity bordering on
        unconsciousness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Those who have been grumbling for a week or ten days wake up in the
        morning feeling miserable, some time that night or the next day they have to send for the
        doctor. If this is watched for a few days, a continued fever is observed.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Or at night a chill will come on, with much pain in the chest, rusty
        expectoration, short, dry cough and other symptoms that will be spoken of under </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bryonia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> later, showing that the trouble is going towards the chest; or the

        state of complete stupefaction in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bryonia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, in which he becomes quite unconscious, as in

        <p align="JUSTIFY">He goes from a state of partial unconsciousness to one of complete
