        <p align="JUSTIFY">The little lands along the back of the toad's neck, when squeezed with
        forceps, ooze a secretion which is soluble in alcohol and has been proved, this is the
        subject we will now consider.</p>

        one I use in practice. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bufo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a wonderful medicine, it profoundly affected the
        mind and especially the intellectual faculties, including confusion of mind and loss of
        memory until the patient gradually goes towards a state of imbecility.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The greatest use of this medicine will be found in nervous conditions,
        throbbings, jerking and spasmodic condition of muscles, ulceration of the skin and mucous
        membranes, and all this in such patients as are tending towards a state of imbecility, a
        state of confusion or weakness of mind.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The imbecility is more frequent in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bufo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> than the active
        states of insanity or mania, yet these appear occasionally through the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The first symptom in the text reads,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Desire for solitude in order to practice masturbation."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This alone throws a flood of light upon the nature of the remedy; the
        lack of government, the lack of control over the sexual longing, and the low-mindedness
        whereby he is willing to abandon himself to the lower things that are in the human race, to
        perverted practices and vices. It tells a great story.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Whimpered, then cried, until he fell into a state of coma."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These states, as brought out clinically, are manifested in adult people
        who act as if they were children. An aspect of child-like simplicity is present and the mind
        returns to a state of child-like innocence.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">An adult takes on the ways of a child, as a state of imbecility. This
        mental state is especially found under </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta
        carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">in adults who have never developed beyond childhood, who have
        always remained children.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A person reasons like a child, talks like a child, whimpers like a child,

        of mind in children who have developed epilepsy, but we do not prescribe this remedy on
        account of the epilepsy; the child has not developed properly, and the epilepsy is only one
        of the manifestations.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The cause is far back, and is really the psoric condition. Thereby the
        mental state has not developed, the child has not grown into a man or woman in intellectual
        attainments or wisdom, and remains as a whimpering, screaming child.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This lack of development is found in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bufo and in <i>Baryta carb</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>.; </i>they are related to each other in that the child-like state
        remains while the body grows.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We see in these medicines the fear and simplicity that belongs to the
        child; always sickly, deficient, never reaching adult fullness or growth, always a child.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"How much like a child that woman appears," or</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"How much like a child that man is."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">We say that of some old people, they are so childish. The old routinists
        have said of those people who are prematurely old or have taken on senility, that they need </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This medicine also stands out in bold type for those prematurely senile;
        the man at fifty acts like an old broken-down man of eighty; he has lost all he had five or
        six years ago, and has taken on a child-like simplicity and innocence, an appearance of
        imbecility.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Then it is that we think of this medicine. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Baryta carb</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">has hitherto been the leading one, but </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bufo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        is also very important.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Left his bed after apathy and ran like mad through the house."</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There it branches off from the condition of imbecility to that of
        excitement of mind. Most of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bufo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patients will be passive, placid, not in a state of
        excitement or mania, but passive in everything. Feeble-minded, simple, child-like.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Angry, bites at surrounding objects."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Easily laughs or cries."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has been used in delirium tremens, during the stages of excitement and
        mental prostration, biting and grasping things.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">"</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Titters</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," now that is more expressive than to say she
        laughs, she titters at every little thing that is said. Titters and says foolish things;
        titters over things that are not laughable; everything said seems to be funny to this
        simple, child-like woman.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You know a child laughs and is merry, but we do not expect such things in
        adults except when what is said is particularly ludicrous. These symptoms are sometimes met
        in epileptics.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"Easily laughs or cries;" </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">easily affected, and extremely sensitive, nervous nature. Again, the most
        extreme anxiety, night and day, wringing the hands and talking about something awful that is
        going to happen when there is nothing to happen; some awful event, some terrible thing in
        the future, it is all darkness and despair, walks the floor and wrings the hands and says
        over and over the same awful things that are going to take place, when in reality the future
        is safe and there is nothing to be anxious about.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This occurs in cases of insanity. Such as are approaching imbecility are
        passive, they have a lack of comprehension of things around; but those that are going into.
        insanity have an increased imagination of the things that surround them. Where these
        symptoms have been induced by secret vice.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Become angry if misunderstood."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is approaching insanity. It is well known to medical men and to the
        courts that these conditions of insanity intermingle in the human race with epilepsy, and
        that an epileptic is not always held responsible for murder, because it is so well known
        that the epileptic state of the body is not confined merely to the spasms of the muscles,
        the sudden falling, foaming at the mouth, clonic spasms, biting of the tongue, etc. These
        alone do not constitute all of epilepsy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The epileptic suffers from an underlying psoric state, which in one is a
        state of imbecility and in another a state of epileptic manifestation, and in another a
        state of insanity. Those who inherit this peculiar constitution, even in one family, exhibit
        it in different ways; one will be insane, another an imbecile, another will die of cancer
        and another will be an epileptic.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bufo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, underlies such a
        constitution; it is an antipsoric, it is a deep-seated, vital remedy; it goes to the very
        heart and interior of man's physical nature, and from this mental state it may manifest
        itself in his ultimates, the fingers and toes, eyes, ears, etc., so that even the touch is
        disordered.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are patches upon the skin that have loss of sensation and others
        with increased sensations. Spasms of various muscles, sometimes local spasm and sometimes
        complete epileptic spasms with bleeding at the mouth, unconsciousness, falling down. Besides
        such grave state, it has milder states that may be called dizziness or vertigo.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The milder conditions of dizziness have gone on to sudden falling and
        collapse, a sudden state of unconsciousness with spasms and biting of the tongue. In the
        proving we find attacks of apathy and partial coma; numbness of the brain. So we see in the
        text that we have conditions ranging from mere dizziness to a complete and profound
        epilepsy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The study of this remedy may reveal to you something of the, nature of
        epilepsy. From the allopathic treatises on epilepsy you will only get the appearance of the
        fit, and the fit is treated as epilepsy. They hunt for remedies to subdue and control the
        fit, thinking when they have done that they have cured the patient.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">They feed these patients </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bromides</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in large doses
        and now and then they branch off into some side issue, but go back to the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bromides</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and stupefy and make imbeciles of their patients. Prescribing for the fit
        has never cured the patient,</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Again, its
        action on the circular fibres of the abdominal aorta furnishes a key-note in epilepsy. An
        awful sensation of anxiety is felt in the abdomen and then there is a sudden loss of
        consciousness; the aura or warning is first felt in the abdomen. Some writers have described
        it as in the solar plexus. The awful sensation occurs as an anxiety and then he falls.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has spasmodic conditions of the eye, but increased vision and
        diminished sensation, and lastly a tendency to profound trophic disturbance.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Little blisters form upon the eye. These little blisters also form upon
        the skin, and the integument is thrown off and there is. no healing. Ulcers will form upon
        the cornea.</p>

        natural state is expected to enjoy beautiful music, whereas in this remedy music brings
        about a state of anxiety. The sense of hearing is so violently exaggerated that every little

        <p align="JUSTIFY">A person, in this mild form of epileptic vertigo, will hardly show
        anything, but he will sometimes come to a perfect standstill and then go on as if nothing
        had happened. What occurred during that attack he knows nothing of.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes be will continue right on doing what he was doing, and nobody
