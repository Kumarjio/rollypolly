        <p align="JUSTIFY">A medicine may be said to be thoroughly proved when it has left its
        impress upon all elements of man; when it has affected his memory and his intellect, when it
        has affected his organs and all their functions, i. e., when healthy man has taken a
        medicine until all these things are affected and the results are known as the effects of
        that medicine.</p>

        of work; aversion to doing everything, mental and physical. Anxiety has been brought out
        more by cures than by the pathogenesis, so that it well enough known to be classed along
        with </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arsenicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">for its anxiety; it may well be classed with </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arsenicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">for its prostration also; it has great weakness; it

        must be studied on its merits,</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There must be no guesswork in the study of provings. Every remedy must be
        used for its own symptoms, and for these there is no substitute. If a remedy does not work,
        the homeopath can only examine the case anew and seek new symptoms and another remedy.</p>

        Disturbances of the taste. It is suitable to low forms of continued fever; it has sordes,
        dark tongue, bleeding tongue and dry mouth, as in typhus, typhoid and yellow fever. Sluggish
        tongue; difficulty in moving it. Difficult swallowing. The muscles of the throat are
        affected causing dysphagia. Constriction of the oesophagus. Violent thirst. Every time he
