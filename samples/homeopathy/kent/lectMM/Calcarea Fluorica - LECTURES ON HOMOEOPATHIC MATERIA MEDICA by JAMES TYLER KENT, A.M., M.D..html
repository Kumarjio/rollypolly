        <p align="JUSTIFY">This chemical union of lime and fluoric acid gives us a remedy with a new
        nature and properties. However conversant one may be with either or both of these elements,
        he could not predict the curative powers held in this double remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I refer to its ability to cure indurated infiltrations of glands,
        cellular tissues and bony formations.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A nodule in the course of a tendon and exostosis, a stony bard gland,
        bony infiltration in the periosteum, rice bodies in cartilages have been cured by this
        remedy wonderful to tell, when there was a paucity of symptoms. It will cure of course when
        symptoms agree, but it needs proving in order that individualization may be oftener
        possible.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A recurrent fibroid in the hallow of the knee was removed once by the
        knife, but returned, and grew to the size of a fist. The leg was drawn up to forty-five
        degrees, and the knee became immovable.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This wonderful remedy was prescribed on the symptoms of the case and the
        hardness of the tumor.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The tumor gradually dwindled, the limb became normal and as good as ever;
        this patient has since born a healthy child is still perfectly free from the trouble. It is
        now ten years since she was cured.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is sensitive to cold, to drafts, to changes in the weather,
        and to damp weather. The symptoms are ameliorated by heat and by warm applications. The
        symptoms are worse during rest.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a useful remedy in gout, with copious pale urine and diarrhea.
        The patient is sad and miserable. This remedy has cured a fluctuating tumor on the cranium
        of infants known as Cephalaematoma.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Blur before the eyes after exerting the vision. Cataract. It cures
        ulceration of the cornea if the edges are hard; also hard, small spots and conjunctivitis.
        It has cured adenoids and thick, yellowish green discharge from the nose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Offensive catarrh of long standing. Scanty enamel of the teeth.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Pain, ulceration and granulation of the throat, worse from cold, and

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pain in the liver at night, worse lying on the painful side, better from
        motion. Cutting pains in the liver, better walking.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Diarrhea in gouty subjects. Itching of anus and hemorrhoids, painful and
        hard bleeding. Fissure of anus. Constipation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Copious watery urine. Strong smelling urine. Urine causes smarting when
        passing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Indurated testes. Nodular testes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Varicose veins of the vulva. Uterine fibroid.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hard nodules in the mammae.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Dryness and tickling in the larynx. Desire to clear the vocal cords.
        Hoarseness after reading aloud. Hacking cough after eating, and in cold air, from tickling
        in the larynx. Spasmodic cough.</p>
