        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The camphor bottle is, a great mischief in the house, as camphor
        antidotes most of our remedies. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in potentized form will cure many complaints.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is suitable in some acute complaints attended with nervous excitement,
        even to frenzy, with spasms and convulsions and finally exhaustion. The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> state is one of convulsions or coldness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In the most acute period of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> excitement, the
        excitability and frenzy of the patient are extreme, or he goes into the other extreme, in
        which the irritability is lost and there is loss of sensation, unconsciousness and coldness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The two extremes may be seen in one patient, one earlier and the other
        later. He may go from the extreme of mental excitement and violence to one of prostration
        and exhaustion, in which the body is blue and cold and yet must be uncovered.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In the mental
        state, there is anxiety and extreme fear; fear of persons, of strange spheres, of the dark;
        the dark is filled with imaginary specters; he dare not get out of bed in the dark;
        everything that moves is a specter and the inanimate things of the room become alive and
        terrify him.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Frenzy. Coupled with this, there is kidney and urinary trouble, like that
        of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cantharis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and
        because of this similarity, the two remedies are both complementary and antidotal to each
        other. If a woman has poisoned herself with </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cantharis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and there is present the frenzy and excitement, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will act as an antidote.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The details of the mental symptoms are worthy of much consideration. The
        patient goes into a state not unlike imbecility, and the appearance is as if it had come on
        slowly. The mind and memory are gone. He closes the eyes, seemingly asleep, and answers no
        questions. Delirious with the heat, rage and mania, wants to jump out of bed or out of the
        window. Screams and calls for help. Tosses anxiously in bed.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Anxiety and almost loss of consciousness. These symptoms will indicate </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in puerperal fever, in congestion of the brain, or in shock from violent
        inflammation of organs. Confusion comes from the shock and comes with violence.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The more violently the patient suffers, the sooner he is cold, and when
        he is cold, he must uncover even in a cold room. This is somewhat like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Secale</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Secale</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">the patient, when
        cold, wants to uncover and to be in a cold room, and it also has frenzy, and so there is
        nothing in what we have yet seem to distinguish </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Secale</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">from </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camph</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But there is another thing that runs through </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camph</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., by which
        a distinction can be made. The coldness, frenzy and heat very often intermingle. When the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient is becoming cold, he has spells of heat which come over him;
        flashes of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">heat</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">intermingle with rending, tearing, burning pains, either in the inflamed
        organ or along the nerves.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is a most troublesome patient to nurse; nobody and nothing
        suits. If an inflammation of the bladder comes on, there is intense pain and tenderness, and
        from the shock of the suffering the mind is in a state of frenzy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Coldness then comes on and the patient wants to be uncovered, wants </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">cold air</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, wants the windows open, but before all this can be done, a flash of beat
        comes on and then he wants the covers on, and the register turned on, and wants a hot iron
        and hot bottles; but this stage now passes off, and while the nurse is bringing the hot
        irons he wants her to open the windows and have everything cool.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You will see at once that these are serious cases. This occurs with
        opisthotonos, convulsions, inflammation of the brain, liver, kidney, bladder, coming on from
        violent shock and cold with great exhaustion. You will see this in one who has worked for
        hours for his life, and when the excitement is over reaction sets in and it is like a
        whirlwind; he has worked until he is exhausted and now he is prostrated, cold and blue; here
        is the sphere where the old woman with her </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> bottle has
        established a reputation, but potentized </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will do more for him than the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> bottle, it will put him into a refreshing sleep.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Menopause</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It is
        useful in the climacteric period with flushes of heat and sweat in a warm room; the limbs
        and abdomen are very cold and she suffers from cold when uncovered and sweats copiously when
        covered. She cannot endure covering to warm her limbs though she suffers from cold.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        of pain; throbbing pain. Contractive feeling as if laced together in the cerebellum. The
        whole back of the head and neck throb like hammers, worse from bending head forward; burning
        and stinging. Frontal headaches.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        about </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in cholera, which is a disease that brings the patient down
        quickly. The face is cold, blue and shriveled, without much sweat, in the cases that would

        rid of a little stool and has convulsions here and there. These bowels symptoms gradually
