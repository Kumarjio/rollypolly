        <p align="JUSTIFY">The most important feature of this medicine is the inflammatory
        condition, and the most important characteristic in the inflammation is the rapidity with
        which it develops into a gangrenous state. inflammation conditions usually follow a definite
        course for days, but when this medicine is put upon a part or taken internally the
        inflammatory state terminates in death of the part with great rapidity.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When taken internally it proceeds almost immediately to attack the
        urinary tract and establish a uraemic state which brings about the mental symptoms; the
        local inflammatory condition comes on with great rapidity, and this brings the patient down
        violently sick in a great hurry.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">From strong doses in the poisonous effect we get startling and alarming
        symptoms; the whole economy is in disorder; grievous symptoms commonly of the urinary tract.
        The parts become gangrenous at an early stage.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The mental
        symptoms are striking. Among those that are guiding are </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">sudden loss</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">of consciousness with red face. Suddenly goes into
        stupor. Confusion of mind. Overwhelmed with strange ideas. Thoughts run riot, and go
        whatever way they will, as if possessed by outside influence.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Head hot, frenzy, delirium, with </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">great excitement and rage</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">,
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">paroxysms renewed by dazzling or
        bright objects, by touching the larynx or by trying to drink water as in rabies.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Fear and confusion of ideas. The mind often runs towards subjects that
        the inflamed parts would suggest.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bladder and genitals</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        The bladder and genitals are inflamed and the excitement and congestion of the parts often
        arouse the sexual instinct, so that there are sexual thoughts and sexual frenzy. Violent
        amorous frenzy, an excitement such as accompanies inflammation attended with thoughts that
        correspond. The sexual instinct has gone mad, the erections in the male are painful and
        violent.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The penis is inflamed and sore and it would be painful to have coitus,
        yet there is this frenzy. Insolence. Blasphemy. Restlessness ending in rage. Restlessness
        causing him to move constantly, a rage and delirium intermingled with amorous frenzy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This kind of mental conduct in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cantharis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is similar to
        what will take place in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hyos., Phos</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., and </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Secale</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">; </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">a violent delirious state intermingled with sexual
        ideas and talk. In some instances he deliriously sings lewd songs and prattles on the
        subject of human genitals, urine and feces, a wild raving on subjects not talked about in
        health except among the depraved.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But in disease, chaste and modest persons, virgins, will speak so that it
        is surprising where they have picked up such language. in such cases it is well to exclude
        everybody from the room except the nurse and doctor. I have seen a dear old mother weep and
        wring her hands and say:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Where did my daughter learn such language?"</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The daughter is not to blame.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is simply a condition of the urinary tract or the menstrual function,
        brought on from cold or exposure, or through the mother's neglect to tell her daughter what
        she should know in regard, to her menstrual function, and how there is inflammation of the
        ovaries or uterus, or outside parts, and the urine burns and causes an inflammatory
        condition of the outer parts, or the urine is retained and there is frenzy. Such in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cantharis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        the parts are inflamed and on fire. Tenesmus and urging not only when the bladder is empty,
        but often when the bladder is full.</p>
