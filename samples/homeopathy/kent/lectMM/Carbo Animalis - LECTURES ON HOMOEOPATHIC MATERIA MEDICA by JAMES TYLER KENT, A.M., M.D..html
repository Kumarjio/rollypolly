        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Glands and veins</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: In
        an inflammation of a gland the veins become weak, and infiltrated, the gland itself becomes
        hard and sore, the tissues around it indurate, and the skin over it becomes purple. The
        glands of the throat and axilla grow purple and indurated with no tendency to soften.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Some of these medicines, after infiltrating a gland, will hurry up the
        inflammatory action, produce sloughing, rapid breaking down, with pus-like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hepar, Mercurius and Sulphur</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But this medicine paralyzes and infiltrates the little veins in the

        no rapid changes; but everything is slowed down. Even the inflammatory process is a passive
        one. Very often a slow quasi-erysipelatous inflammation comes on, the part becomes purple

        hot and so, sensitive that they can hardly be touched; at first bright red, then purple,
        with a tendency to resolution if let alone. But the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo animalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        inflammation comes on slowly, its progress is slow, and there is no tendency to repair.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Enlargement of veins here and there over the body, varicose veins. There
        is intense burning in the part inflamed. which is indurated and purple. The glands of the
        throat burn.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sluggish buboes in old broken down constitutions, in early stages of
        syphilis, inflame, become enlarged, purple, hard and burn. Lumps in the mammary glands. A
        purple lump the size of a hen's egg will form in the mammary gland.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It does not go on to suppuration, as you would expect it to, it just
        stays there. It does not enlarge much, but it is hard.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The woman has so much burning in the vagina that she persuades the
        physician to make a more careful examination than he has done. He will probably find the
        whole cervix inflamed, purple and somewhat, enlarged. She says it burns like coals of fire.</p>

        eventually produces ulceration of the tissues in various parts, especially in glands.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After a while-but not early in the case - an ulcer forms, and perhaps
        after ulcerating for a time it comes to a standstill; it has become a sluggish ulcer.
        Indurated ulcers.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Ulcers and cancer</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: A
        bubo breaks down and forms an ulcer. All at once it stops suppurating and around about the
        tissues become hard and purple. The laudable discharge ceases, a bloody, ichorous discharge
        takes its place, and, the surrounding parts burn.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Now in ulcers and fistulous openings, where the walls become hard and
        burn, and the discharge becomes acrid, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo
        animalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is frequently the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is not surprising that this remedy has been one of the most suitable
        for old, stubborn cancerous affections; for cancerous ulcers. They all burn, they are all
        surrounded by infiltrated, hardened, dark-colored tissue, and they all ooze an acrid
        ichorous fluid.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has cured these troubles in old feeble constitutions with night-sweats
        and much bleeding. It has relieved in incurable cases, and has apparently removed the
        cancerous condition for years, even though it comes back afterward and kills. This remedy is
        often a great palliative for the pains that occur in cancer, the indurations and the
        stinging, burning pains.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course we do not want to teach, nor do we wish to have you infer, that
        a patient with a well-advanced cancerous affection, such as scirrhus, may be restored to
        perfect health and the cancerous affection removed. We may comfort that patient, and restore
        order at least temporarily, so that there is freedom from suffering in these malignant
        affections.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Most patients that have cancer are really in such a state of disorder
        that only a temporary cessation of "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">hostilities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" can be expected; and anyone who goes around
        boasting of the cancer cases he has cured ought to be regarded with suspicion.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Do not dwell upon the cancer, for it is not the cancer but the patient
        that you are treating. It is the patient that is sick, and whenever a patient is sick enough
        to have a cancer his state of order is too much disturbed to be cured.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The proving of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo
        animalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> presents the appearance of a
        broken down constitution. it brought out in the provers just such symptoms as occur in old,
        feeble constitutions with poor repair and lack of reaction.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hence the medicine has been a great palliative for patients suffering
        from malignant infiltrations and indurations; suspicious indurations round about and under
        the bases of ulcers; suspicious indurations in glands.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A gland becomes inflamed, hard and remains so. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo animalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        stands at the head of the list of remedies that have that condition.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All through the remedy there is hypertrophy. Tissues pile up here and
        there into hard nodules; tissues pile up in glands and in organs. The economy has lost its
        balance, and the result is a disorderly distribution of material. Great prostration, want of
        energy, associated with palpitation, anxiety and disorders of the pulse.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Weak pulse, rapid pulse, irregular pulse. Beating in blood vessels. There
        is turmoil in the economy, sometimes described as heat. A rushing of heat as though the body
        was full of steam.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Awful sensation through the chest and in the head, like some great
        earthquake taking place. These are due to abnormal conditions of the venous side of the
        heart.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Women</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Flushes of
        heat; pulsations here and there. Hemorrhages. And of course the woman is more likely to
        bleed than the man; hence we have menses too early, too long, too copious. Prostration with
        every menstrual flow.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo animalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> woman sinks down at every menstrual period as if she
        would die. Such striking weakness is not at all accounted for by the quantity of the flow.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Chronic induration, with enlargement of the uterus, which gradually grows
        from year to year (</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aur. m. n.).</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> Induration of the cervix and the whole uterus.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Copious flow of the leucorrhoea. Offensive uterine discharges. Ulceration
        of the uterus, going gradually toward the malignant state. The menses are black and
        offensive. Finally this poor, feeble woman, who has been plodding along for years with this
        condition, goes into malignant ulceration of the cervix, which burns, bleeds constantly and
        oozes a foetid watery flow. The burning pains in the uterus extend down to the thighs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Whenever this patient puts the child to the breast she has a sensation of
        emptiness in the stomach, sinking in the pit of the stomach, and she must take the child
        away.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are many uterine troubles, with burning, stinging, smarting, a
        yellow brown saddle over the bridge of the nose, something like the mottled yellow saddle of
        Sepia. All sorts of disordered conditions of the uterus.</p>
        <p align="justify">Surging of blood upward to the head, rousing up in sleep, with horrible
        dreams. This poor mortal is suffering from troubles in the base of the brain, has tearing
        pains in the head, and especially of the occiput, growing increasingly sensitive to cold,
        increasingly chilly, increasingly waxy, until we have phthisis or cancer, with varicose
        veins and all the conditions that I have described.</p>
