        searching medicine, suitable in old, broken down constitutions, suffering from chronic
        diseases.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Only occasionally is it indicated in acute diseases. Its complaints are

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Muscular power</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        Gradual decrease of muscular power, a paralysis. Paralysis of the oesophagus, paralysis of
        the throat, such as occurs after diphtheria; paralysis of the upper eyelids; paralysis of
        the bladder; paralysis of the limbs, of the lower limbs; great lassitude, muscular
        relaxation, indescribable fatigue and heaviness of the body. And there is a tremulousness, a
        quivering, jerking, twitching of the muscles, twitching in sleep.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        striking feature is found in the tendons, which become shortened, resulting in a temporary
        or permanent contracture, and the limb is drawn up.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Tendons of the forearms contract, and there is gradually increasing

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Joints</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Closely
        related to this is a rheumatic state of the tendons and ligaments about the joints,
        sometimes with swelling, but always with pain and ending in a shrivelling of the joint, a
        tightening up of the joint so that it becomes ankylosed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Great stiffness of the joints, and while this is going on the patient is
        growing weaker, is running into a state of melancholy, of hopelessness, anxiety and fear.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Constantly present in his mind is the hopelessness and a feeling that
        something is hanging over him, that something is going to happen. These are general features
        of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. They all go to make up one picture, they are inseparable.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Hysteria</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Another kind
        of progressive trouble in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is hysteria. Gradually increasing hysteria.
        Hysterical cramping. The woman loses all control of herself and says foolish things.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Her nervous system becomes extremely sensitive to noise, touch,
        excitement or anything unusual. Starting from the slightest noise; starting in sleep;
        twitching and jerking; the child is easily startled, or acts as if startled without cause.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Rheumatic diathesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        The paralytic weakness is associated with the rheumatic diathesis. The rheumatic states are
        peculiar. The patient himself can endure neither heat nor cold. They both aggravate his
        rheumatic conditions, his nervous conditions and himself in general. His pains are
        ameliorated by heat, but they are aggravated in dry weather.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Great deformity of the joints; they are enlarged, soft and infiltrated,
        always worse in dry weather; more pains and aches during dry weather. Rheumatism that
        affects both the muscles and the joints. This patient is also aggravated by exposure to
        cold, dry winds. Many an individual who has gone from the low lands of the East up into
        Colorado will come down with rheumatism from the cold, dry winds.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Let such a patient as I have described take a ride in the cold lake wind
        and he will have paralysis of the side of the face exposed to the wind. A long drive with
        the east wind coming against the face.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The next day that side of the face will be paralyzed. Such a paralysis
        will almost always recover under </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Reading, tearing, paralytic pains; pains that, benumb; pains that fairly
        take the life out of him, they are so severe. And they are likely to remain in one place for
        a long time. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has often greatly mitigated the lightning-like pains
        of locomotor ataxia.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, with all these sufferings the patient is slowly growing weaker, till
        at length he can no longer walk, he can no longer sit up, he is so tired and weak that he
        must lie down. He is tired in body and mind. It is a paralytic fatigue.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Convulsive symptoms. Cramps, now here, now there. If frightened he is
        almost sure to have some form of convulsive condition, The woman with tendency to hysteria
        will have hysterics from fright; nervous girls that are more inclined to chorea, will start
        with jerking of muscles and will keep it up day and night. Chorea even at night. Localized
        chorea, jerking of single parts, chorea of the tongue or of one side of the face.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Epilepsy in young persons at the age of puberty, from fright, from, being
        chilled or exposed to some great change in the weather. Epilepsy, chorea, paralysis,
        hysteria worse during menses. We see that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a deep medicine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Worse from exposure to cold, dry wind. It also has rheumatic complaints
        aggravated in the warm, damp days, in wet weather, but this is not so striking.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Any one of the complaints that I have mentioned may be brought on by
        bathing in cold water. A long, dry, cold spell will aggravate the rheumatic troubles,
        getting wet or becoming chilled by bathing will start them.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Insanity</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has cured insanity; not acute mania with violent delirium, but mental
        aberration of the passive kind, where the brain has become tired. The constitution has been
        broken down with long suffering and much trouble, and finally the mind is in confusion.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">At first the patient recognizes his inability to do anything and then
        comes this foreboding that something is going to happen. He is unable to think, and
        consequently unable to carry on his business. He is going into imbecility. Full of timorous
        fancies.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Timorous anxiety," overwhelmed with fearful fancies.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">At every turn there is fear that something is going to happen. Fear of
        death, fear that something will happen to his family. Always anticipating some dreadful
        event. That is a striking feature of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> mental state. It is found in old, broken down mental
        cases, after prolonged anxiety; after a prolonged struggle of some sort.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Anxiety before falling asleep. In addition to this, the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient lacks balance. Everything excites him. The more he thinks about his
        complaints, the worse they become. Mental and other ailments from long-lasting grief and
        sorrow. The injurious effects of fear and prolonged vexation. Tired from vexations of
        business.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eruptions</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        suppression of eruptions is apt to bring out mental symptoms. Mental exhaustion,
        hopelessness, despair, appearing after the suppression of an eruption with zinc ointment. He
        was fairly well while he had the eruption, but when it disappeared his mind gave out.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Eruptions on the side of the head and face, and extending over the whole
        head. Thick, crusty eruptions covering the whole occiput. When these eruptions are
        suppressed in children, chorea is apt to follow. In the adult there will be trembling,
        paralytic weakness and the mental state, sometimes pains in the nerves.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Headaches</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The driving
        in of a facial eruption will frequently result in facial paralysis. The healing of an old
        ulcer with stimulating lotions and ointments will have a similar result. Then he also
        suffers from violent headaches, congestive, pulsating headaches; violent, stitches in the
        head, worse in the evening.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But the headaches are, as a rule, nondescript; only occasion do we find a
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> headache standing out by itself. It will usually be associated
        with rheumatic and gouty conditions which also affect the scalp. The scalp contracts and
        tightens up in places like the contractures in other parts. Rheumatic headaches; sometimes
        the pain is so severe as to cause nausea, and vomiting. Blinding headaches followed by
        paralysis.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Torticollis. The head is sometimes drawn to one side by the shortening of
        the muscles of the neck. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a curative remedy in this shortening of the
        tendons and muscles.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is rich in eye symptoms. Very often the patient says that the eyelids feel
        so heavy that he can hardly hold them up. This gradually increases until it becomes an
        actual paralysis. Sometimes there is the appearance of a veil before the eyes; foggy vision.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Flickering before the eyes. Air seems full of little black insects. Then,
        again, large black or green spots are seen. After looking at the light a green spot appears
        and remains in the field of vision for a long time. Diplopia.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">And the vision gradually grows weaker until it is lost. Paralysis of the
        optic nerve. Lachrymation, tears acrid, burning; ulceration, copious discharges from the
        eyes, agglutination of the lids, paralysis of the eye muscles.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        scrofulous ophthalmia with ulceration of the cornea; chronic, purulent ophthalmia of psoric

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Warts</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Another very
        strong feature of this medicine is its tendency to grow warts. Warts on the face, on the tip
        of the nose, on the ends of the fingers, on the hands.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hard, dry, horny warts come out on various parts of the body.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is natural feature of this remedy to produce copious, thick, tough,
        gluey discharges from mucous membranes.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Ear and nose</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        catarrhal troubles creep up the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Eustachian</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> tube, from the nose and throat into the car,
        resulting in roarings, cracking noises and reverberations in the ear. There is great
        accumulation of car wax; deafness of catarrhal origin and deafness from paralysis of the
        auditory nerve. Severe, dragging pains in the ear.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The nasal catarrh is very troublesome. Old, atrophic catarrh with
        accumulation of crusts throughout the whole nasal cavity; post-nasal catarrh with
        ulcerations, granulations and copious, thick, yellow or yellowish-green discharge;
        nose-bled; frequent attacks of acrid, watery coryza. Much itching of the nose. A wart grows
        upon the tip of the nose.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face and mouth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        pains in the face are violent. Neuralgic pains from exposure to cold. These pains often
        accompany the facial paralysis. Tearing pains in the face, stitching pains, pains of a
        rheumatic character.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Ulcerations about the mouth and nose. Fissures about the lips, the wings
        of the nose and the corners of the eyes. Fissures seem to form upon the least provocation.
        Fissures of the anus, of the skin about the joints. Old cases of salt rheum with fissures in
        the bends of the joints. Fistulous openings with indurated walls.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The gums become scorbutic and settle away from the teeth; bleeding and
        ulceration of the gums. Violent, tearing pains in the roots of the teeth from riding in the
        wind. Old rheumatic subjects suffer all through every dry spell with toothache.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Stitching, tearing, pulsating pains in the teeth; even in the sound teeth
        on drawing in cold air. Frequently recurring abscesses of the gums. Putrid sour or bitter
        taste in the mouth.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When the paralytic condition affects the tongue then we have stammering.
        There is also the condition of complete paralysis of both the pharynx and oesophagus. Hence </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is useful in the results of diphtheria when it has been maltreated or when

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The food goes down the wrong way or enters the larynx or the post-nares.
        Paralysis of the organs of speech, paralysis of the tongue, awkward at talking, awkward at

Dryness of the mouth and throat;
        rawness of the throat; must swallow constantly on account of a sensation of fullness in the
        throat, a nervous feeling in the throat. This is often a forerunner of paralysis. The </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Staphysagria</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">patient when excited

        annoyance.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Burning in the throat; jerking in the throat; constantly scraping thick,
        tough mucus from the larynx. Study the sounds that patients make in order to ascertain where
        the mucus comes from. The presence of hoarseness shows that the trouble is in the larynx.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Desires and aversions, stomach</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Causticum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient sits down to the table hungry, but on seeing
        the food his appetite vanishes. The thought, sight or smell of food takes away the appetite.
        This is a common symptom in the pregnant woman.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Thirst after eating; thirst for cool drinks with aversion to water desire
        for beer, smoked meats, pungent things, aversion to sweet things and delicacies. Most
        remedies that have loss of appetite have desire for, sweet things, pastry, etc. The symptoms
        of thirst with aversion to drinking is very much like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The two run very closely together in the paralytic condition of the
        throat. There is a queer sensation in the stomach as if lime were slaking there. Trembling
        in the stomach; burning. Bread causes a sensation of heaviness and pressure, coffee seems to
        aggravate all the symptoms of the stomach, but a swallow of cold water relieves.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many symptoms in this remedy are made better by a swallow of water. The
