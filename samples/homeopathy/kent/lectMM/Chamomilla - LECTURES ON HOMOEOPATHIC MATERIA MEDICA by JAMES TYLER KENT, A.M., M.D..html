        <p align="JUSTIFY">The constitutional irritability is so great that a little pain brings

        an uncommon thing, even now-a-days, and especially when practicing in the country, for the
        young mothers and the nurses to give for baby </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camomile</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> tea for colic,
        and the baby goes into convulsions. No one attributes it to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camomile</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> tea,
        but the doctor will see at once, if he knows </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, that these
        convulsions are due to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camomile</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Then you see the jerkings, the convulsions, the hot head, the great
        sensitivity; sensitiveness, to noise, and to persons, and the great irritability between the
        convulsions, convulsions of children; they become stiff; roll the eyes; distort the face;
        twitchings of muscles; throw the limbs about; clinch the thumbs; bend the body backwards.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Such is the natural appearance of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> convulsions;
        those convulsions that come on in oversensitive children, when they have suffered a good
        deal of pain from teething. Teething ought to be a perfectly healthy process, but it is
        really looked upon as a disease, and many doctors carry medicines for "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">teething children</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," and administer them; first one and then another.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has fallen
        into that bad use of being given </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"for
        teething".</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> It is true that many
        children suffer from irritability of the brain, convulsions, stomach disorders and vomiting
        about the time of dentition, but I say dentition should not be a diseased state, it should
        be normal.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If they were in healthy they would cut teeth without sufferings. But slow
        teething we have to contend with, and that irritable state, that oversensitiveness, so that
        he child does not sleep. Wakes up as if it had awful dreams. Wakes up in excitement, vomits,
        has diarrhea with teething.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These symptoms come at this time when the child has not been properly
        looked after. Or perhaps the mother has not been properly qualified for parturition.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Neuralgic pains all over the body with numbness. Twitching, darting,
        tingling pains. The pains are mostly ameliorated by heat, with the exception of the teeth
        and jaws. Toothache, pain in the teeth ameliorated by cold, and made worse by heat. But the
        earaches and pains in the extremities are made better by heat.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You will see in the text under "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Temperature and Weather</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">"
        the symptom:</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">but the fact is the pains that are worse from heat are about the teeth
        and jaws, and it is decidedly a particular symptom relating only to a part; whereas it is
        true that the patient in the general state, entirely contrary to what this says, is better
        by heat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains in general are better by heat. The patient himself is better by
        heat. Consequently, this being a particular, it should state that the pains that are so
        commonly worse by heat are of the teeth.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The most important part of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is the mental
        state. It pervades the whole economy and you will see that every region that is taken up,
        every part that is studied, brings into it the mental state of the patient.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy has more mental symptoms than symptoms in any other part.
        Crying.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Piteous moaning. Irritable."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The irritability is so great that it manifests itself sometimes in a very
        singular way. The patient seems to be driven to frenzy by the pains, and she forgets all
        about her prudence and her diplomacy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Loss of generosity</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        she has no consideration for the feelings of others. She will simply enter into a quarrel or
        dispute regardless of the feelings of anybody.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So, when you go into practice, do not be surprised when you go to the
        bedside of a patient in labor, who is full of pains and sufferings, if she says:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"Doctor, I don't want you, get out." </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">just such an one will pass under other circumstances as a lady. The
        awful pains that she is having drive her to frenzy, and this frenzy, this oversensitiveness
        to pain, is coupled with the mental state.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Inability to control her temper, and the temper is aroused to white heat.
        Now, in the child, the child whines and cries and sputters about everything. It wants
        something new every minute. It refuses everything that it has asked for. If it is for
        something to eat, for something to play with, for its toys, when these are handed to the
        child it throws them away; slings them clear across the room.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Strikes the nurse in the face for presuming to, get something or other
        that the little one did not want, yet had asked for. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Capriciousness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It seems that the pains and sufferings are sometimes
        ameliorated by passive motion, this very particularly in children.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains seem to be better when the child is carried, so the child wants
        to be carried all the time. This is true in the colic and in the bowel troubles. It is true
        with earache; it is true with the evening fevers, and the general sufferings from cold and
        conditions while teething.</p>
        </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Children must be carried</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The nurse is
        compelled to carry the child all the time. And then there is the restlessness and
        capriciousness about the members of the family. The child goes two or three times up and
        down the room with the nurse, and then reaches out for its mother; goes two or three times
        up and down the room with her and then wants to go to its father. And so it is changing
        about. Never satisfied. It seems to have no peace.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When it has earache the sharp shooting pains cause the child to screech
        out. Carries the hand to the ear. The pains often cause that sharp, piercing tone of the
        voice. Adults in pain cannot keep still the pains are so severe; it is not always that they
        are decidedly ameliorated by moving, but they seem to be. But they move because they cannot
        keep still.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">So the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient is tossing in bed, if in bed; not an instant
        quiet. And along with all of these the same irritability; becomes violently excited at the
        pain angry at the pain; irritable about the pain; will scold about the pain the pain is so
        torturesome. Aversion to talk, and snappish. The patient is constantly sitting and looking
        within herself when pains are absent.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        patient sits and thinks within herself a sort of introspection. Cannot be induced to say a
        word. Sadness. The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> child cannot be touched.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Wants to do as he pleases. Wants to change; wants to do something new.
        The answer from both the adult and the child are snappish. Complaints come on from
        contradiction; from anger. Convulsions come on from anger.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If the child is suffering from, whooping cough it will have a coughing
        spell, a spasmodic cough from being irritated. Goes into a spunky state, gets red in the
