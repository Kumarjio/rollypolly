        painlessly.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In a perfect state of health, of course, there are no stones in the bile
        that is held in the gall bladder, but this little cystic duct opens its mouth and a little
        gall stone engages in it, and it creates and irritation by scratching along the mucous
        membrane of that little tube.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When this pain is a shooting, stabbing, tearing, lancinating pain,
        extending through to the back, Chelidonium will cure it. The instant it relieves the patient

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The remedy has relieved that spasm, the little duct opens up and the
