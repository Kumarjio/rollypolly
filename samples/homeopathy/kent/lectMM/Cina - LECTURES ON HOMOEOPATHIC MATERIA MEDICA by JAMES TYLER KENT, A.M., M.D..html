        a child's remedy, but it is suitable for conditions in adults that are seldom thought of. A
        marked feature running through is </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">touchiness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">mental and physical.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        something, but does not know what. The child is aggravated by touch and even by being looked
        at, and is worse from seeing strangers. The skin is sensitive to touch. The scalp and back
        of the neck, the shoulders and arms are so sensitive, that it is almost a soreness as if
        bruised. The hyperesthesia is both mental and physical. The old routine of giving </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        for worms need not go into your notes, for if you are guided by symptoms the patient will be
        cured and the worms will go.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This patient is disturbed by everything, worse after eating even a
        moderate meal. The child takes a moderate supper and dreams all night, jerks and twitches in
        sleep, rouses up in a fright, talks excitedly about what he has dreamed, thinks it is real,
        and sees dogs, phantoms, and frightful things lie has dreamed about.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The dream is prolonged into the wakeful hours. Screams and trembles, with
        much anxiety on waking; whines and complains. While this little patient is aggravated by
        being handled yet he wants to be carried and kept busy, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">; </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">although not so intensely irritable as that remedy,

        of; the first touch aggravates.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This aggravation from touch and sensitiveness runs through the
        convulsions and fevers, with delirium, glassy eyes, drawn mouth and white ring around the
        nose and mouth. With a disordered stomach he has convulsions after eating, with the head
        drawn back and glassy eyes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The stomach is sour and the child is always spitting up sour milk and
        belching sour wind. The child smells sour.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hallucinations of smell, sight and taste, in the delirious state, after
        taking cold, or on waking from sleep; wakes up with the delusion. Things taste and smell
        differently. The senses of taste and touch are exaggerated or perverted.</p>

        but the head symptoms are predominant. From slight disturbances of the mind he cannot
        digest, and he has diarrhoea. The complaints are aggravated in summer; the heat affects the
        brain, arrests his functions, and on comes diarrhoea with green, slimy stools or white
        stools, and the child vomits.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is pre-eminently </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">brain</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">; the orders are not received from the brain and so

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The pains are sometimes better from turning the head from side to side.
        You will see this in sensitive women, who must have their hair down; rolling the head

        gurgle down the oesophagus before and after convulsions. When the head symptoms are present,
