        Persons who have suffered much from neuralgias due to malarial influences, who have become
        anaemic and sickly from repeated haemorrhages, are likely to develop symptoms calling for </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> produces a
        gradually increasing anaemia, with great pallor and weakness. It is sometimes- indicated in
        plethoric individuals, but this is the exception, and even in this class we find that the
        symptoms are tending towards the cachectic state, which is avoided by the prompt action of
        the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Throughout the body there is a gradually increasing sensitivity, a
        gradually increasing irritability of the nerves; the nerves are always in a fret, so that
        these people will say:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Doctor, what is the matter with me, I am so nervous?"</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Everywhere
        there are twinning, tearing, cutting pains in the limbs and over the body. And so great is
        the sensitiveness to touch that the nerves can many times be outlined; as, for instance, the
        little nerves in the fingers, because of their extreme sensitiveness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient grows increasingly sensitive to touch, to
        motion, to cold air, so that he is chilled from exposure. The pains are brought on by
        exposure to the wind, by cold air, and are increased by motion and touch.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Old malarial conditions that have been suppressed with quinine; gradually
        increasing pallor, bloodlessness, cachexia, until the patient is always catching cold, has
        liver troubles, bowel troubles, disordered stomach, is made miserable and sick by nearly
        everything he does.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He cannot eat fruit without having indigestion; he cannot eat sour
        things. He is debilitated, pale, waxy, suffers from pains, such as are found in quinine
        subjects, and breaks out into a perspiration up the least exertion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This patient bleeds easily; bleeds from any orifice of the body from the
        nose, from the throat, from the uterus. And after hemorrhage complaints come on.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Running through the remedy as a general constitutional state is a
        tendency to congestion and often inflammation, in connection with hemorrhages. Inflammation
        of the part that bleeds or of distant parts. For instance, a woman aborts, has a
        haemorrhage, but with apparently no provocation, inflammation of the uterus or of the lungs
        sets in.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With these inflammations there is also great irritability of the tissues,
        tearing pains, cramping in the muscles and actual convulsions. When a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient bleeds a little, for instance, in confinement, right in the midst
        of the bleeding convulsions come on. You would scarcely need to think of any other remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        labor, she may go into convulsions.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the midst of labor the pains cease and convulsions come on. Another
        feature about this inflammation is its rapid progress and intensity, quickly going into
        gangrene. Inflammation after haemorrhage and the parts rapidly turn black.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        of the veins. Not exactly a varicose condition, but a sort of paralysis of the coatings of
        the veins. The veins become full during fever.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All of these complaints are such as we find in broken down constitutions,
        in feeble, sensitive patients, especially in sensitive women. Sensitive to the odors of
        flowers, of cooking, of tobacco. Weak, relaxed, emaciated, pale, with feeble heart, feeble
        circulation and tendency to dropsy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Dropsy runs through the remedy; anasarca and also dropsy of shut sacs. A
        peculiar thing about this dropsy is, that it comes after hemorrhage. In the anaemic
        condition; directly following the loss of blood, dropsy appears. This is the typical </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        Old liver subjects with jaundice. They have lived for a long time under the influence of the
        malarial miasm. Feeble, sensitive, anemic. We see such cases in the South and Southwest, and

        mistake. Periodicity is the symptom upon which </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Quinine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">is given. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has periodicity,
        but in no greater degree than many other remedies and is not so frequently indicated as
        routine prescribers suppose. Allopaths give </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Quinine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">whenever there is any periodicity in complaints. Still
        periodicity is a strong feature in this remedy. Pains come on with regularity at a given
        time each day. Intermittent fevers appear with regularity and run a regular course.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A part of this periodicity is an aggravation at night, and sometimes
        sharply at midnight. In colic that comes on regularly every night at 12 o'clock, and it may
        be, perhaps, a week before you, suspect it to be a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> colic. A lady had
        colic and bloating of the abdomen every night at 12 o'clock.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        any further trouble. Haemorrhage from the nose coming on with regularity. Diarrhoea at

        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a general aggravation after eating. Remember that this is a
        chilly patient, sensitive to draft, sensitive to cold, whose complaints are brought on by
        being exposed to cold air; sensitive to touch, sensitive to motion. Extreme irritability of
        the tissues.</p>

        conditions following the loss of blood and other animal fluids; as, for instance, in those
        who are suffering from sexual excesses, from secret vice. They have become feeble, sleepless
        and irritable.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is weakness and general coldness of the skin; twitching and jerking

        surprise to you. It is just such as you would expect in this nervous, sensitive patient.
        Weakness of mind. Inability to think or remember. Full of fear at night. Fear of animals,
        dogs, of creeping things. Wants to commit suicide, but lacks courage. Gradually the mind
        grows weaker, he uses wrong expressions or misplaces words.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Lies awake at night making plans, theorizing, building air castles,
        thinking of the wonderful things he is going to do some day. In the morning he wonders how
        he could have thought such foolish things.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After sleep his mind is clear and he looks more philosophically on the
        affairs of life. Unable to entertain any mental proposition that, means work. He dreads
        work. He is apathetic, indifferent, low spirited, silent, disinclined to think. He is unable
        to control the mind, to make it do what he wants it to do. You see it is not as yet a real
        insanity.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This state of mind comes on after haemorrhage. Insomnia after
        haemorrhage. A woman, after having suffered great loss of blood, will be sleepless night
        after night.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">After hemorrhage we may have dizziness. it is a natural consequence;
        dizziness and fainting. But ordinarily, after the proper diet for a few days, these symptoms
        will have disappeared. With the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient they go from bad to worse. The woman after

        full of headaches. Congestive headaches in broken down constitutions. Extremities cold and
        body covered with a cold sweat. Rending, tearing pains. Pressing and throbbing. As soon as
        the air strikes the head those pains come on.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Headache better in a warm room; worse from touch; worse from motion;

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensitiveness of the tissues; sensitiveness along the course of the

        by touch.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The jar and motion of walking hurt the head. Even turning over in bed
        aggravates. Cannot ride in a carriage or anything that jolts. Ameliorated by hard pressure.
        Throbbing headaches, aggravated by a draft of air, in the open air, from the slightest
        touch; ameliorated by hard- pressure. The scalp feels as if the hair was grasped roughly. It
        is sensitive to touch. Profuse sweating of the scalp. Headaches aggravated at night.
        Headaches from sexual excesses; loss of animal fluids.</p>

        roaring, buzzing, and singing, chirping like crickets in the ears. Dry catarrh of the middle
        ear. Hardness of hearing is not infrequently the result of this condition.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It gradually increases until there is total deafness, and the noises in
