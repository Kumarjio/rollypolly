        milder in its action. It has the same exhaustion from exertion, dyspnoea, sweating and

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">What will forcibly call your attention to a remedy will be the curing of
        a bad and typical case. I remember the first time my attention was decidedly called to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cistus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I had put it on my list to study from time to time and had come to the
        conclusion that it was only a side issue, until a young lady of nineteen years of age fell
        under my observation.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Glands</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The glands of
        the neck were large and hard, the parotids especially; she had foetid otorrhoea; her eyes
        were inflamed and suppurating; there were fissures at the corners of the eyes; her lips were
        cracked and bleeding, and she had salt rheum at the ends of the fingers.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        what I needed; and although she had had an immense amount of Homoeopathy, good and bad, this
        remedy cured.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The glands inflame, become swollen and suppurate. It causes cries and
        cures old ulcers. It has a scrofulous constitution. It is useful in chronic diarrhea, with
        enlarged glands, even in those who are flabby, sickly and pallid and who cannot go upstairs
        without losing, their breath.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mucous membranes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: All
        the mucous membranes throw out a thick, yellowish, offensive mucus and hence it is suitable
        in old and troublesome catarrh. The chest fills up with mucus and he feels relieved after
        expectoration, but after he empties the chest it feels raw.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has eruptions, herpes, tetter, scaly eruptions, salt rheum on the
        hands and ends of the fingers, with cracking and bleeding of the fingers in winter and from
        washing in cold water.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All its complaints are worse from mental exertion. He is excitable. His
        cough, headache and pains are worse from mental exertion. Pains shoot from the head to the
        ear. Shooting, stitching, tearing pains in inflamed parts. Red discharges from the ear date
        back to eruptive diseases.</p>

        he is compelled to fast headache comes on, and like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lyc</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., the headache will
        be relieved after eating.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Frontal headache with coldness. In a warm room the perspiration comes
        out, and it is cold, and the more he sweats the colder he gets. Pain in the forehead with
        cold sweat, and the colder he gets the worse the pain becomes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sick headaches and great prostration with the headache. Sensation of
        internal coldness of the forehead, especially in warm room. Pressing pain at the root of die
        nose with headache. The parotid gland is so much enlarged that it pushes the head to one
        side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The glands of the abdomen swell with chronic diarrhea, and the swelling
        may be tuberculous. Enlarged glands, with or without eruptions.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: All over the
        body there is a sensation of crawling; formication tingling and creeping like ants, and no
        eruption. He scratches till the skin is raw trying to get relieved of the itching and
        prickling. Eruption upon the face; eczema. Eruptions about the ear.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cold feeling or burning in the nose, This is difficult to distinguish. In
        acute coryza the nose fills up with thick, yellow mucus, and when this is blown out it
        leaves the nasal cavity empty, and there is irritation; one will say it is a rawness,
        another will say a coldness, and another will describe it as a burning.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Nose</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There is relief
        when the nose fills up again with mucus. In </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. the mucus in the
        nose is so acrid that it burns, but in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ant.
        c., Aesculus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, and in this remedy when the
        nose is empty there is a burning or rawness. The sensation of rawness, coldness or burning
        is caused by the inhalation of air.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">An epidemic of coryza was prevalent, and this was the strongest symptom,
        the pain caused by inhaling air, great burning from inhaled air. But it is not in the acute
        coryza that we see the value of this remedy, it is in the old, chronic case, with thick
        discharge, and a cold feeling or burning in the nose when inhaling air.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sharp shooting, intolerable itching and thick crusts, with burning

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This remedy has
        cured lupus on the face. Caries of the lower jaw. Open, bleeding cancer on the lower lip.
        Lupus exedens. Pain in all the joints of the face. It cures old, deep-seated, eating ulcers
        about the ankle and shin, with copious acrid discharge, formication and swollen glands,
        aggravation from bathing, extreme sensitiveness to the open air, only comfortable when very
        warm.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The teeth have all sorts of disturbances; the gums settle away, the teeth
        become loose; scorbutic gums. The same cold feeling is described in the throat as in the
        nose-smarting and coldness. Mouth and throat full of mucus. The throat feels rough, as if
        full of sand. Dry spots in the throat. The throat looks glossy, shining as if vanished, in
        old atrophic catarrhs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Every cold settles in the throat. Hot air feels good everywhere. In old
        cases there is trouble with scrofulous glands, which are enlarged, and the patient wants the
        heat; goes to the register and turns the heat on, wants to feel the heat in the nose, throat
        and lungs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Patients going into tuberculosis have that desire for beat; chilly
        persons, They do not feel cold to touch, but they are cold subjectively, chilly. Hawking of
        gum-like mucus, especially in the morning, fauces inflamed and dry. Suppuration of the
        glands of the throat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These patients crave pungent things, and especially want something to
        warm them up, something to build them up, something stimulating herring, cheese; something
        strong.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">with inflamed glands. We see its tendency to produce enlargement of the
        glands, and this would make us think of it in growths with involvement of the glands all
        around. The glands of the neck are enlarged in lines, like knotted rope, as in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hodgkin’s</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> disease.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Only a limited number of remedies have this knotting. Itching of the skin
        and mucous membrane. The itching in the ear is not relieved by scratching, and the part is
        raw from the constant rubbing and scratching. The eyes constantly itch. In the throat there
        is continuous itching. In the chest there is a constant tickling, causing cough. At the anus
        and all other orifices there is itching, and the itching parts are rubbed until raw and
        bleeding.</p>
