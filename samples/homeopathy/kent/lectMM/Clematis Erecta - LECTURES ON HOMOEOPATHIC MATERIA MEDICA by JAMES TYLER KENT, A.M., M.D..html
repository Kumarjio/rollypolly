        partially proved, and consequently it applies only to a few conditions, but these are very
        important, so that it cannot be passed over.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">

        eruptions almost erysipelatous in character. One almost constant mental state is that he
        fears to be alone, yet dreads company. fie dreads the necessity of having company, and it
        seems that the atmosphere is full of frightful and distressing things to worry him.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This makes him low-spirited. The remedy seems to fit the sycotic
        constitution in its mental state and its generals.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It seems to be fitted to those who had gonorrhoea recently suppressed,
        because after that suppression will come on this mental state with inflammation of glands.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is rather singular about the eruptions. One would not think that from
        so harmless a little shrub so much trouble would come; but there are persons who are just as
        sensitive to this vine as to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and it resembles </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">to a great extent in its manifestations.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It produces just, as poisonous a condition as </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Here I might speak of several
        remedies which relate to the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">poison.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There are many vesicular remedies that look like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">,
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and all of them you will have to use
        more or less in their antidotal relations to each other, but it is well to be sure in a
        given case which one of them produced the poison.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton tig., Rhus, Ranunculus, Anacardium </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and Clematis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> at
        times look so much alike that I am unable to tell them apart by their eruptions.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">They are all similar enough to each other to become universal antidotes.
        The others are all deeper acting than </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ranunculus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">the little buttercup, has cured epithelioma of the lids. It has cured
        cancerous affections, so we say it goes deep into the tissues.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">On the outer head we have a part of the manifestations of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Clematis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> vesicular eruptions with great itching, stinging and crawling. Now what is
        true of the eruption here will be true of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Clematis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> eruption
        everywhere. It is aggravated from washing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It will smart and burn, and a quasi-inflammation will set in from
        washing. Contrast this with the internal features of the remedy. In the teeth and jaws the
        pain is violent, but while the eruption is made worse from cold applications, the pain
        inside the jaw and the teeth is relieved by cold water held in the mouth, and aggravated
        violently from heat, and from the warmth of the bed.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The eruption is aggravated from the warmth of the bed, and also from cold
        washing. We have to go into the details a little to see whether an eruption is </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">or whether it is </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Clematis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, or something else. Vesicular eruptions filling with yellow fluid and with
        induration under the vesicles.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It produces eruptions very closely related to herpes and eczema, and they
        spread. About the eyes we have vesicular eruptions. If seen in one stage it will be
        vesicular, and if later, it will be seen as an ulceration. Simple and graver forms of
        herpes. Herpes zoster about the body.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Burning, and smarting of the eyes; worse from closing them.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Inflammation of the iris.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Eyes inflamed, protruded, dim.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chronic irritation of the lids."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Teeth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The pains in
        connection with the teeth are aggravated from the warmth of the bed, which is general; they
        come at night, are aggravated from warm things held in the mouth and ameliorated from
        holding cold water in the mouth.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Stitching and drawing pains in the teeth; worse at night; better for a
        short time from holding cold water in the mouth; better from drawing in cold air; worse from
        the warmth of the bed. The toothache is tolerable during the day, but as soon as he lies
        down in bed and assumes a horizontal position it increases to an intolerable degree. Pain in
        hollow tooth, better by cold water or drawing in cold air.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Glands</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Swelling of
        the glands of the groin is a striking feature even when connected with scirrhus. It is
        connected also with suppressed gonorrhea, and with rheumatism of the joints. Pain and
        swelling of the right spermatic cord; this is worse at night, worse from walking and from
        the warmth of the bed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bladder</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: While it has
        both sides, strange to say there is more trouble in the glands that are on the right side of
        the body than on the left. It has produced much trouble in the bladder. Constant urging to
        urinate, most painful tenesmus. Flow stopping and starting. The urethra is painful to
        pressure. Micturition is remarkably slow, only a feeble stream because of the smallness of
        the urethra.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is the nature of this remedy to infiltrate and inflame tissues, and,
        hence it is useful in those cases of gonorrhoea where they have been slow in passing away,
        where they have been treated by injection.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That slow inflammation of the urethra will infiltrate and the urethra
        feels like a large whip-cord, painful upon pressure, and this goes on until the canal is
        almost closed. You will be surprised to find, when </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Clematis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is indicated,
        that after giving that remedy the discharge is re-established, and soon the old stricture
        goes away. At the end of two or three months he feels nothing of it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A striking feature in connection with the urine, bladder, etc., is that
        the patient cannot quite empty the bladder. He always feels as if there was a little more,
        and when he appears to have finished it will keep dribbling away. This is a common feature
        of stricture.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Inability to evacuate all the urine at once.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When beginning to urinate it burns the worst, while urinating it sticks
        in urethra, and after urinating it still continues to burn.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Discharge from the urethra of thick pus."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is seldom indicated in the very first stage of gonorrhoea during the
        highest inflammation, but in those cases that are inclined to hang on. Then come the
        sequelae if gonorrhea be suppressed. Inflammation of the testes is common, and this is one
        of the medicines suitable.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Strange to say, the right side of the body is more commonly affected than
        the left. Intermittent flow of the urine. Urine stops and starts with the chordee still
        present. The right spermatic cord is very sensitive. Pain in the testes, drawing. Painful,
        inflamed and swollen testes. Orchitis with much painful swelling and hardness. Now when the
        swelling has gone down-perhaps you gave </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., which was the remedy for the time, but it did not
        finish the case, there is induration of this portion. Swelling of the right half of the
        scrotum with thickening and banging low down.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Women</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Provings have
        not been made very much in women, which is to be regretted, because it would be well to know
        if this remedy affects the ovaries as it does the testes. It has been clinically used, and
        has cured many troubles in women, especially inflammation in the mammary gland.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Ulceration and hardness of glands.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Scirrhus of the breast with induration and ulceration.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Scirrhus of the left mamma with stitches in the shoulder;"</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">this is a clinical symptom, "worse in the night."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She cannot bear to be uncovered.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has rheumatic conditions of the limbs from suppressed gonorrhea. Great
        nervous weakness and twitchings of the muscles. It has pain on lying down and preparatory to
        going to sleep. An electric shock; twitching, jerking, as if a faradic battery had been
        turned on. It has also a general febrile condition, but nothing very striking.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Vesicular eruptions on the body. Herpetic eruptions here and there it has
        a herpetic constitution.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Eruption of vesicles and pustules from the former exuded a clear,
        watery secretion, from the latter a purulent fluid."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Yellow vesicles and yellow pustules. Both are common to this remedy.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Dark, burning eruptions with violent itching."</p>
