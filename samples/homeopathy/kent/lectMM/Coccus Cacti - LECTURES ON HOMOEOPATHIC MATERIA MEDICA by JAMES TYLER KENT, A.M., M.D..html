        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a little remedy and will be a relief after the study of so many
        difficult ones. With fuller proving it will doubtless show itself a deep-acting
        constitutional remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Although it has cured some deep-seated chronic troubles, it has been used
        chiefly in acute affections. This is only because of the scantiness of its provings and our
        lack of knowledge concerning it in a general way.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Very few mental symptoms have been brought out. Its use, so far as
        demonstrated, is mostly in catarrhal conditions of the air passages, and whooping cough,
        with copious, ropy, jelly-like mucus.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Great quantities of this mucus form in the nose, in the throat, in the
        air passages generally, and in the vagina. The routine practitioner, whenever be sees thick,
        ropy, gelatinous mucus, thinks only of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kali
        bi.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That comes from the study of key-notes. But it must be remembered that
        other remedies besides </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kali bi</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">have this.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Cough</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Spasmodic
        cough; whooping cough; the cough of drunkards. The chronic catarrhal state of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coccus cacti</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient comes on especially in the winter. It comes on when the cold
        weather begins and lasts till the warm weather comes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is cold, and his complaints come on in cold weather. He is
        sensitive to cold, easily takes cold. But you must distinguish between the patient himself
        and his complaints, because they are entirely opposite to each other.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When he once becomes sick from exposure to cold, he is always worse in a
        warm room and better in the cold air. His cough is brought on in a warm room; from being too
        warm in bed; from drinking warm things. It is better from drinking cold things in a cold
        room; worse from exertion; from getting heated up; from becoming warm; that is, after the
        complaint has once set in, it reverses itself.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is not unlike many other remedies. I have received many letters from
        doctors, saying:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Why is it that in your repertory and in Boenninghausen's, certain
        remedies are put down as better from cold and worse from cold?</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They certainly cannot have both."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But they do have both, sometimes under different conditions and sometimes
        under the same conditions. Sometimes these are primary, sometimes they are secondary
        symptoms. A remedy must be examined to ascertain how it is that these circumstances can be
        the very opposite of each other.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But commonly </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Boenninghausen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> registers both those things that belong to
        particulars and those things that belong to generals, and if the symptom, in his judgment,
        is strikingly worse by a certain circumstance, even if it is the very opposite of the
        general, he had that symptom in boldfaced type. Phos. is a good illustration of what we have
        been talking about.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If you make a careful study of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phos</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. you will see that
        the complaints of the chest are all worse from cold, from cold air and from being cold. He
        catches cold and it settles in the chest, and the cough and irritation in the chest are
        worse from cold and being exposed to cold air.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But he wants cold things in the stomach. His stomach feels better from
        cold things. Let him have head trouble and his head is better from cold, he wants cold
        things in his stomach. If he has stomach trouble, it is made worse by anything hot; he wants
        cold water to, drink, and as soon as it gets warm, he vomits it up. You see </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phos</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        is worse from cold and worse from heat. The pains in the extremities are better from heat.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The chronic cough, as has been said, is likely to begin with cold weather
        and last all winter, with a copious formation of mucus in the chest. It is a spasmodic
        cough, forcing the patient into the most violent efforts. The face becomes purple. Finally
        he retches and vomits long strings of tough, ropy mucus filling the mouth and throat and
        causing him to choke.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is due to the fact that the mucus is so tenacious that it cannot be
        ejected from the pharynx in the usual way, therefore he must vomit. Now, there is a striking
        feature of this remedy. Anything coming in contact with the pharynx, the inside of the
        mouth, or even the gums, produces gagging and retching and will bring on the cough.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Chest</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: We find this in
        the chronic states of sensitive persons, who are unable to brush the teeth or rinse the
        mouth without gagging and sometimes vomiting.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a general hyperesthesia of the skin and mucous membranes.
        Sensitive to the pressure of the clothing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With the chest troubles there is much dyspnoea. He cannot walk without
        bringing on difficult breathing. He cannot ascend a height without suffocation. After the
        quantities of mucus are cleared out the cough is better and he goes on for two, three or
        four hours, when another one of these awful attacks comes on.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They are apt to be worse at night when he becomes warm in bed. If he can
        lie in a cool room without much covering he will go longer without coughing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The whooping cough is of a similar character. You will see the child
        lying in bed with the covers off. It wants the room cold, and the mother will tell you that
        if she can get to it quickly enough with a drink of cold water she can ward off the
        paroxysm.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The chest fills up with mucus until respiration cannot be carried on any
        longer and it must be cleared out, yet the child will resist and hold its breath to prevent
        coughing. You will be astonished to see how speedily </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coccus cacti</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will change
        the character of that cough.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">One of the earliest signs of improvement will be observed in the easier
        respiration. The cough becomes less violent, the retching passes away, and in a week or ten,
        days the cough will go, too. Cough worse after eating, worse on waking, worse in a warm
        room.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In the early stages of whooping cough </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo veg</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. will develop
        and. bring out the symptoms and furnish a good picture for a second prescription, even if it
        does not cure.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Discharge of thick yellow mucus from the nose; nose stopped up, with
        inclination to sneeze. Great dryness of the nose. The air passages burn after the mucus has
        been cleared away. The chest burns from the mere exhaling of air. Sore throat with redness.
        Tickling in the throat. Sensation of a hair or crumb lodged in the throat behind the larynx.
        Fauces very sensitive.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Arch of palate and fauces, as far as visible, very red. Burning in the
        throat &lt; in the warmth, especially when warmed up in bed, &lt; from warm drinks, though
        hot drinks are not so bad. Better from cold drinks. If the patient gets warm in bed or the
        room gets warm he commences to clutch the larynx and cough. The slightest touch on the
        palate or even the gums in examination of the throat will cause gagging sometimes when the
        parts look normal. He cannot hawk without gagging. On swallowing food sometimes it will come
        right back again and cause gagging and retching.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Great thirst; wants water often and in large quantities. Nauseous taste
        in the mouth; never rid of it. Nausea in the throat. Vomiting of white, bitter tasting
        froth. Toothache; sudden drawing pains in the teeth, worse from cold and from touch.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The mental
        symptoms are chiefly depression and anxiety. Great sadness; a cloud seems to hang over
        everything.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Apprehensiveness. especially at 2 to 4 A.M. This state may alternate with
        loquacity and liveliness, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There are other symptoms worse after sleep; wakes in the morning with
        basilar headache, or with headache in the forehead; &lt; mental exertion; after lying down;
        sometimes &gt; from slow motion; &lt; on coughing and from exertion; &gt; after sleep.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Kidneys</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: A strong
        feature is its action on the kidneys, resembling acute parenchymatous nephritis. Albumen in
        the urine. Dark red sediment in the urine. Pain shooting from the kidney to the bladder and
        down the legs; &lt; from motion.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Renal colic. Urging to urinate, but inability to pass urine until a large
        clot of blood has been passed. In </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coccus
        cacti</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> the right side of the heart is
        affected, the vessels become friable and there is haemorrhage, oozing of blood, forming
        great black clots.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The above symptom suggests a woman with uterine hemorrhage. There are
        haemorrhages of the uterus where the blood flows freely, coagulates slowly and does not form
        much of any clot in the vagina. But in this remedy the clots form very rapidly and the
        vagina becomes packed, and the bladder cannot be emptied until the clot is expelled. Uterine
        hemorrhage is a strong feature of this remedy. Copious, frequent, prolonged menstrual flow.
        Large, hard, black clots fill the uterus, are expelled by labor-like pains, and form again.
        Inflammation of uterus and vagina, with copious, thick, white, jelly-like, ropy mucus.
        Soreness of the vulva; cannot bear the pressure of the clothing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Haemoptysis, dark, clotted &lt; from exertion.</p>
        <p align="justify">In the male there is impotence with dull pain in the loins. Dull pains in
        the region of the kidneys, with albuminuria; heavy sediment in the urine, etc., just such a
        state as you would find in a child that had taken cold after scarlet fever.</p>
