        drug is characterized by a general sensitivity. Sensitiveness of vision, of hearing, of
        smell, of touch; sensitiveness to pain. it is most astonishing sometimes about this great
        sensitiveness. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pains are increased by

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensitiveness of hearing is so great that sounds are painful. Pains in
        the face, toothache, headache; pains in the lower limbs; everywhere aggravated by noise.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All the nervous disturbances possible are found in this medicine, and
        they are all aggravated by noise. Even the opening of the door and the ringing of the
        door-bell produces great suffering. Such patients are so sensitive that they hear sounds
        which those in a state of health cannot hear.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Perhaps no medicine in the Materia Medica approximates this sensitiveness

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many remedies have increase of nervousness from noise; noise aggravates
        headache, and aggravates suffering about the head, and makes some persons nervous, But pain
        in the extremities aggravated by noise is peculiar. It seems that the noise disturbs him so
        that he cannot bear pain.</p>

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Such a symptom is common in coffee drinkers. There was no fever. Intense
        stinging, burning pains in the skin with the redness and heat with coarse rash coming on
        suddenly, leaving just as suddenly. The sensitive part is aggravated by cold air, aggravated
        by any wind or from fanning, from motion, yet aggravated by warmth. Aggravated from anyone
        walking across the floor. The woman I referred to scowled when I was walking toward the bed.
        A number of times I have seen such things relieved within a few minutes by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coffea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        sudden emotions. Hysteria, nervousness, weeping. Pitiful weeping from pain trembling and
        weeping from hurt feelings; the slightest neglect. The greatest mental and physical
        exhaustion; great restlessness lying awake most of the night.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The wakefulness produced by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coffea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is well known,
        even to the laity. It is taken by nurses to keep them awake nights with their patients. The
        Coffea patient is quick to act and to think. So full of ideas that she lies awake nights
        making plans, thinking of a thousand things; utterly unable to banish the thoughts that
        flood the mind; hears the clocks on the distant steeples, as do </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium, China </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and

        excitement, that she hears noises that are purely imaginary. Memory active, easy
        comprehension full of ideas; increased power to think and to debate. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coffea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> increases the mental capacity. But after a while reaction follows; she
        becomes stupid and sleepy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is no end to the fancies, to the visions. Fanciful visions come
        before the mind. Recalls things not thought of for years; recalls poetry that was recited in
        childhood. Eyes brilliant; pupils dilated; face flushed head hot.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Teeth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: With all these
        nervous states the patient dreads the fresh air. He is extremely sensitive to cold,
        sensitive to the wind and cold weather. Complaints come on in the cold weather, from the
        cold air. Pain in the mouth and jaws, </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">better
        from holding ice-cold water in the mouth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This applies to toothache and faceache where it is deep in the jaws. Hot
        head; inflamed condition of the gums. Pain in the teeth; rending, tearing pain in the teeth,
        brought on from exposure to cold, from emotions, from excitement, from joy; aggravated from
        motion; ameliorated by ice or ice-cold things; aggravated by warm food.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Cannot drink warm tea, it so intensifies the pain. That is a particular.
        The particulars contrast with the generals. In one place you may see </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"better from cold" </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">in black-faced type, but it relates to the face and jaws. Worse
        from cold is a general. Aversion to cold air, aversion to the open air unless it is very
        warm and still. Aversion to wind.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        the growth of the tooth in a painless manner.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That is the description of a nervous child with many nervous brain and

        excitement. The child hears things its mother cannot hear; sees things; imagines things.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Wakes up in fright. Sees this, that and the other thing in the room.
        Wakes up excited as if it had visions. Looks for things, and finally sees they are not
        there. Such things are strong features of Coffea.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Ears</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: At times the
        head is hot, the face is flushed and, the eyes so brilliant that one fears apoplexy.
        Patients will often tell you that they hear a "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">noise</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" in the head,
        a ringing and roaring in the occiput.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The ear is the one organ capable of registering sounds. But strange to
        say, the ears are sometimes very deceiving. Roaring in the ears sometimes seems as if it
        were in the occiput. Sometimes it is accompanied with a sensation of tingling or bubbling in
        the head.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When patients say,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"I have a roaring in the head,"</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">you know that means in the car; many times accompanying roaring, ringing
        in the ears, buzzing in the ears, is a peculiar sensation of vibration in the head that is
        mistaken by the patient for a sound.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">I mention that because the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coffea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient feels a
        crackling or a bubbling in the occiput. The head feels badly; it feels too small. Headache,
        as of something pressing hard upon the surface of the brain.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You would naturally suppose there was a pressing because of the
        congestive state heretofore described.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Headache as if the whole brain were torn and bruised, or dashed to

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The eye and the head symptoms are worse from noise and light.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is another head symptom which is quite common. A feeling as if a
        nail were driven into the head. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coffea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> headaches are worse from walking, from motion; from
        the mere moving across the floor, he says he feels a draft of air on his head. And that is
        true of the pain in any part of the body.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coffea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient should have a pain in the hand, swinging of
        the hand through the air will aggravate. It is worse both from the motion and from the air.
        I want to illustrate that in this way in order to show how sensitive he is to air, and
        especially the painful part to cold air; when he moves against the air, against even still
        air he feels it. But the amelioration of the toothache from cold is an exception, is a
        particular.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The neuralgia of the face is a common feature of old coffee drinkers.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensitive persons take coffee and finally become habituated to it. They
        say they cannot get along without it. They must have coffee. Such individuals should stop
        coffee. When coffee furnishes a crutch it is a sure indication that drinking it must be
        stopped.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">So it is with tea or any beverage. Such persons sometimes become
        sensitive to coffee, and they drink it in great quantities; the face becomes red; headaches
        come on, and other symptoms of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Coffea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Stopping coffee brings out quite a proving, and you
        have to study </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cham. and Nux</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> for an antidote.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In all these remedies you get opposite effects. Now </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will illustrate that. The first effect of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is to
        constipate. Let several doses be given, and as the effects of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> wear off
        he may have diarrhea. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> eaters can seldom stop because a diarrhea comes on.
        If you should ever have an </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> case and diarrhea comes on </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. will
        nearly always control it. But there are individuals who reverse that. Often small doses of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will bring on dysentery, and if it is increased, bloody dysentery and
        inflammation of the bowels come on. Of course, one is action and the other the reaction.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
