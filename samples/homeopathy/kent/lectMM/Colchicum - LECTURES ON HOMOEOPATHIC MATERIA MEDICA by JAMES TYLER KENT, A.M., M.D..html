        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is rather singular that traditional medicine used </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> so much for gout. In all the old books it was recommended for this malady.
        The provings corroborate the fact that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> fits into many conditions of gout.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Rheumatism</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Acute
        rheumatism and uric acid diathesis; rheumatic complaints in general, with swelling and
        without swelling. But traditional medicine does not tell us what kind of gout to give it in
        or what kind of rheumatism.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It was really the medicine of experience. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"if it is gout, try Colchicum."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The question of what was to be done with the patient<i> </i>when the
        remedy failed never came up.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It was</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"Give the prescription and keep at it," </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and drugs were administered until the patient,
        steadily growing worse, passed from one doctor's hands, to another's. It is true that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> fits into the gouty state. Spells of cold, wet weather will slack up the
        flow of urine, make it scanty, or decrease the quantity of solids in the urine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This takes place in the provings of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and has been
        verified many times. It is well known that such a condition will bring about or intensify
        the gouty state. If the solids in the twine are deficient, if they are not carried off in
        the urine, something must happen, and the gouty state comes on.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is
        aggravated by cold, damp weather; by the cold rains in the Fall. It is aggravated by
        anything that will debilitate. It is aggravated in the extreme heat of summer; it has a
        summer rheumatism; the heat will slack up the flow of urine or the quantity of solids in the
        urine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A striking feature running through the remedy is its tendency to move
        from one joint to another, from one side to another, from below upwards, or from above
        downwards. Rheumatic conditions with swelling, or without swelling; first here, next there,
        changing about from place to place.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Dropsical condition</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        Another striking feature is the general dropsical condition. When the hands and feet swell,
        and there is pitting on pressure. Dropsy of the abdominal cavity, of the pericardium; of the
        pleura and dropsy of serous sacs. Swellings that are inflammatory and rheumatic; swellings
        that are dropsical, with pale urine. Whether copious or scanty, still it is pale.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Muscular rheumatism and rheumatism of the white fibrous tissues of the
        joints. Rheumatic troubles that have been going on for some time, will end in cardiac
        troubles. When cardiac troubles with valvular defects are present, almost the first thing
        the busy doctor thinks of is a history of rheumatism.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Let me say that a part of the study of Materia Medica consists in the
        observation of sick people. A busy physician learns without books, though of course he
        should familiarize himself with the literature, so that from reading, as well as
        observation, he may acquire a knowledge of the general nature of sickness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When he listens to the patient's story or makes a physical examination,
        he knows how such cases usually conduct themselves. He knows what to expect. He knows the
        natural trend of sickness and instantly recognizes what is strange and unusual. He will not
        recognize what is strange and unusual unless he knows what is natural.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So your books on symptomatology and pathology, diagnosis, etc., will tell
        you much of this, but as you gain experience in homeopathic practice you will get a much
        finer idea of this because your Materia Medica teaches you to observe more closely.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The Materia Medica man learns to single out and trace every little thing
        in order to individualize. So it may be said that years of observation in studying disease,
        studying the sick man along with the Materia Medica, will open to the mind a much grander
        knowledge of the sicknesses of humanity than can be had by practicing traditional medicine.
        Traditional medicine benumbs the ability to observe.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Motion &lt;</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: All the
        complaints of this remedy are aggravated from motion. The painful complaints, the head
        complaints, the bowel complaints. the liver complaints, the stomach complaints, are all
        worse from motion. Such an aggravation from motion that he dreads to move. About as marked
        as we find in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bryonia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Aversion to motion, and aggravation from motion. Aggravation from
        becoming cold and in cold, damp weather. He is a chilly patient, sensitive to cold. Most
        rheumatic patients are sensitive to cold, but there are a few exceptions. There is no
        greater rheumatic patient than the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ledum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">patient. He presents, both sides. Though he is cold, his pains are
        ameliorated by cold. In Colchicum the pains are ameliorated by heat, by wrapping up, by
        being warm.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">If he moves, any suffering that he may have will be intensified. Great
        prostration accompanies the complaints of this remedy. Weakness of the limbs, great
        exhaustion, nervous exhaustion of a typhoid character. He gradually grows weaker like one
        going into </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bright's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> disease. He has grown weak for some time, and he is
        pallid and waxy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">His hands and feet pit upon pressure. Examine the urine and you will find
        albumen in it. The urine becomes black like ink with albumen. There is an unusual degree of
        irritability of the tissues, soreness, sensitiveness to touch, sensitiveness to motion;
        bruised feeling of the joints and of the whole body.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Touch and motion bring on a painful sensation in the body as of. electric
        vibrations. Great weakness and exhaustion. He cannot exert himself in the least without
        causing dyspnea, Must lie down; does not want to move; sinking of strength; seems as if his
        life will flow out of him from motion and from exertion; so tired and exhausted.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This naturally occurs when going towards </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bright's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        disease, when going towards a continued fever. Kidney affections and liver affections.
        Lassitude, prostration, anxiety. The muscles twitch and electric shocks pass through the
        body. A paralytic weakness was observed in the poisonous effects and too prolonged provings.
        The jaw hangs down, the muscles are flabby, relaxed. He lies on the back as if sinking;
        slides down in bed like one in typhoid, in low forms of rheumatic and in continued fevers,
        so great is the exhaustion. Paralysis of the limbs or of one limb, or of any part.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient is almost constantly sweating, even with
        fever, and sometimes the sweat is cold. A draft blows upon him, suppresses that sweat and
        the paralytic condition of the limbs comes on; suppression of urine and retention of urine.
        This describes the profound character and type of sickness. Low forms of sickness;
        prostrating sickness; sickness with nervous trembling; with great exhaustion. After acute
        disease has passed away, great weakness and dropsy follows. Dropsy after scarlet fever.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With all these troubles, the stomach and the bowel symptoms are very
        decided. This is like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cocculus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Absolutely unable to touch food. Nausea, gagging,
        retching at the bare mention of food in his presence. The thought and smell of food bring on
        nausea and vomiting. With all these low forms of disease, these states described, we can see
        that this kind of weakness is little different from the Cocculus weakness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        delirium, prostration, depression of mind, great sensitiveness to pain, which he seems to
        feel in his mind, and it brings out mental symptoms. Very sensitive to pain; confusion of
        the mind; disorders of comprehension. Cannot understand what he reads. The headaches are all
        of a rheumatic character. Very often the whole skull, the pericranium, is sore as if
        bruised. The scalp is sensitive. Pressure in the head-constriction; pressing, bursting
        headaches. Heat in the head. Tearing in the scalp. Headaches are all aggravated by motion.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The eye symptoms
        are of a rheumatic character, are connected with rheumatism, rheumatic fever. It is not very
        uncommon to have iritis in connection with rheumatic fever and it is a strong feature of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Ulcers of the lids, styes, much lachrymation in the open air. The tears
        excoriate and cause redness of the lids.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He takes cold easily. Sneezing, stuffing up of the nostrils. Nosebleed in
        rheumatic and gouty constitutions. But there is one feature that is more marked in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> than all others. He is so sensitive to odors that he smells things which
        others do not smell. He smells odors from which he is nauseated.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Strong odors make him quite beside himself."</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">You say "soup" or "broth," </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">or something to eat, and he gets sick.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Nose</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: He can smell the
        things in the kitchen, in spite of much precaution, and this runs through the remedy. In
        typhoid fever, prostrated beyond the usual and typhoid is always prostrated enough, he is
        unusually prostrated. He cannot take milk, cannot take raw eggs, cannot take soup, because
        he gags at the mere thought of them.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He has gone on for days, and his family are afraid that he is going to
        starve to death. That aggravation from odors is so strong with him that it seems to take
        possession of him. It involves his appetite, his weakness, his stomach.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">So it does seem that it is a strong feature. Notice that this is one of
        his loves; it is a perverted love, and the loves are general whether they are manifested
        through the eyes, nose or touch. It enters into his very life because it involves hatred to
        odor, and when it stands out in low forms of disease like the continued fevers, the
        exhaustive fevers and rheumatic complaints it becomes a general. It would be a particular if
        it were something that applied to the things alone, but you see it enters into the very
        innermost.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Involves a hatred, becomes mental, becomes a part of the man. He himself
        may be said to hate odors, hate the smell of food and the thought of it. Do not say "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">food</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">"
        in the presence of a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient, but give him </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colchicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> first,
        and pretty soon he will want something to eat. It removes that hatred for food. What a vital
        thing it must be when a man hates that which will keep him alive.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
