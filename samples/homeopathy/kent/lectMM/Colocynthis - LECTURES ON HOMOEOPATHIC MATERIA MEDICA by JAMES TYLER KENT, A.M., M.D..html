        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The principal
        feature of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is its severe, tearing, neuralgic pains; so severe
        that the patient is unable to keep still. Sometimes they are &gt; by motion - at least it
        appears that they are worse during rest- &gt; by pressure and sometimes &gt; by heat. Pains
        occur in the face, abdomen, along the course of the nerves.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These pains are often due to a very singular cause, namely, anger with
        indignation. Hence persons who are haughty and easily offended or chagrined have </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> complaints. Anger will be followed by violent neuralgia in the head, eyes,
        down the spine and in the intestines.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In spite of extreme restlessness there is great weakness with the pains.
        It patient suffering with chronic diarrhoea, with severe colic, will sometimes become so
        weak that he can hardly speak. A feeling of faintness, or even fainting, is by no means an
        unusual concomitant of the pains. Griping occurs along the course of nerves, and in some
        cases numbness, pricking and tingling, like the crawling of ants in the part affected.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With many doctors </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a routine remedy for sciatica; and only when it
        fails to do they take the symptoms of the case in order to find the remedy that is
        indicated. There is no excuse for such practice. Where the pain is better from hard pressure
        and from heat, where it is worse during repose and drives the patient to despair, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will generally cure.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But it is not indicated in all cases. Some remedies select the muscles
        and tendons, some the bones and periosteum, while others select the great nerve trunks in
        which to manifest their symptoms. The pains of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> appear, as a
        rule, in the larger nerves.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The mental symptoms are not very striking. As soon as the prover of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> begins to have pains a long the course of nerves he becomes irritable;
        everything vexes him; he is worse from vexation.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Screams with the pains. Walks about the room and becomes increasingly
        anxious as the pain goes on. Disinclined to talk or to answer, or to see friends. His
        friends irritate him and he wants to be alone. He has all he can do to stand those terrible
        pains.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Vomiting and diarrhea frequently come with the pains, especially if they
        are in the abdomen.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Colic comes on in paroxysms that grow in intensity. The patient becomes
        increasingly nauseated until finally he vomits and he continues to retch after the stomach
        is empty.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> produces a
        state in the nervous system like that found in individuals who have for years been laboring
        under annoyances and vexations. A man whose business affairs have been going wrong becomes
        irritable and nervous exhaustion follows.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A woman who must watch her unfaithful husband night and day to keep him
        away from other women gradually assumes a sensitive irritable state of mind and is upset by
        the least provocation. This is the state of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> prover.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will seldom find this medicine indicated in strong, vigorous, healthy
        people who have suddenly become sick. It is more likely to be in the constitution just
        described, and those who are in the habit of overeating.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We find tearing pains in the scalp, brought on by anger; exhaustion,
        pains that are better from pressure and heat, and worse when not in motion. Constant,
        gnawing pains in the head.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Head</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Painful,
        tearing, digging through the whole brain, becoming unbearable when moving the eyelids.
        Intense pain through the whole head; worse from moving the eyes. Severe, pressing, tearing
        headache, causing her to cry out.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Intermittent headache in those of a rheumatic, gouty or nervous
        diathesis. Pain tearing and screwing together. Violent periodical or intermittent headache.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Such are some of the expressions in the text. But the particular
        character of the pain is not as important as the circumstances that are likely to cause it
        and the conditions in which the patient has been living.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Knowing the life
        of a patient affords much knowledge of the patient himself. The same violent neuralgic pains
        are found in the eye. Rheumatic iritis, worse in the evening and night. Severe, burning,
        cutting and sticking pains in the eye. Burning is more characteristic of the pains of the
        eyes than of other parts of the head and face. Sharp, cutting- stabs; pressing pains.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The faceache is
        especially important, because </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is one of the most frequently indicated remedies for
        neuralgia of this region.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        pressure, worse if anything during rest, and are brought on by excitement or vexation.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">They are generally on the left side; while those of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Belladonna</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">are on the right,

        the nerves and are relieved by heat and pressure.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The expression of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> face is one of anxiety from the severity of the
        suffering. No matter where the pain is the face is distorted. Finally, it becomes pale and
        the cheeks become blue.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tearing pains in the cheek-bones, or more correctly, in the infra orbital
        nerve where it emerges from the foramen. Sometimes this pain feels like a hot wire,
        sometimes like a cold nail, and sometimes it is tearing, burning or stinging.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Frequently it spreads over the face, following the ramifications of the
        small branches of the nerve, usually on the left side. The patient cries out and is very
        restless. Tearing or burning pain extending to the ear and head.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">All pains are better from pressure, but this is in the beginning. After
        the pain has been going for several days with increasing severity, the part becomes very
        sensitive and pressure cannot be endured.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Stomach</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Aversion to
        food. Violent thirst. Colic brought on from drinking while overheated; from eating
        indigestible things, from high living; colic from eating potatoes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Potatoes and starchy foods disagree with the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        patient like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. The vomiting of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is different
        from that of most other remedies .</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Nausea does not appear at first, but when the pain becomes sufficiently
        intense nausea and vomiting begin, the contents of the stomach are ejected and the patient
        continues to retch until the severity of the suffering decreases.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The stomach pains are clutching, cramping and digging; as if grasped by
        the fingers.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Abdomen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Similar pains
        occur lower down in the abdomen, but they are still better from hard pressure, and from
        doubling up which amounts to pressure, come on in paroxysms of increasing severity, until
        the patient is nauseated and vomits, and are associated with great restlessness and faint,
        sinking feeling at the pit of the stomach.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The victim, bends down over the back of a chair, or over the foot-board
        if unable to get out of bed.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Guiding
        Symptoms</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> we find several pages of
        repetitions, showing how extensively this medicine is applicable in abdominal complaints
        where these symptoms are present. It would be well to read them.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The pains in the lower part of the abdomen are relieved by drawing up the
        limbs and pressing with the fists. In the violent ovarian neuralgias of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Colocynth</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, the woman will flex the limb of the painful side hard against the abdomen
        and hold it there.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The physician asks:</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"What has happened to give you these pains?</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Her answer is likely to be:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"My servant spilled some dirty water on a handsome rug, we had some
        words over it, and this is the result. "</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Colic from anger with indignation; better from bending double and worse
        in the upright position, while standing or bending backwards.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Colic of infants when they are relieved by lying on the stomach as soon
        as the position is changed they begin to scream again,</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The same symptoms accompanying the diarrhoea and dysentery, The stools
        consists of white mucus, are thick, ropy and jelly-like; at times bloody.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">At first they may be copious, strong smelling, pappy, and later watery,
        yellow, scanty and almost inodorous.</p>
        <p align="justify">Diarrhoea and dysentery from anger with indignation; the most awful
        tenesmus during stool; urging to stool with colic. Eating ever so little, rings on the
        colic, urging and stool. Watery stools after eating. Many of these cases, find relief from
        heat and the warmth of the bed.</p>
