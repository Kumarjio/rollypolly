        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This medicine is a deep, long acting antipsoric, establishing a state of
        disorder in the economy that is so far reaching and so long lasting that it disturbs almost
        all the tissues of the body.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Glands</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The complaints
        are brought on from taking cold, and the glands become affected all over the body. From
        every little cold the glands become hard and. sore. Infiltration in deep-seated diseases in
        the region of ulcers and in the region of inflamed parts; in the glands along the course of
        the lymphatics, so we get a chain like knots.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The glands under the arm inflame and ulcerate. The glands in the neck, in
        the groin and abdomen become enlarged. Ulcerated parts indurate. An abscess of the breast
        becomes surrounded by lumps and nodules. Nodules in the breast even where milk has not yet
        formed; lumps and nodules, indurations and enlarged glands form under the skin all over the
        body.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has been used
        extensively for malignant affections of glands, because it takes hold of glands from the
        beginning and infiltrates, and they gradually grows a stony hardness, like scirrhus.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, another grand feature running through this remedy is the action upon
        the nerves.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Trembling, jerking of the muscles and twitching from the weakness of the
        nerves. Inability to stand any physical effort without great exhaustion.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Gradually growing paralytic weakness, somewhat as was described in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cocculus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Exhaustion of body and mind, that is a general slowing down of all the
        activities of the body. The liver becomes indurated, sluggish, enlarged. The bladder is
        weak, can expel only a part of the urine. Or sometimes there is a paralytic condition and no
        expulsive power. This shows that the remedy increases toward a paralytic weakness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Hysteria.
        Hypochondriacal state of mind, with the nervousness, trembling and weakness of the muscles.
        He gets tired in the earlier stages, but finally this goes on until the limbs are paralytic.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A great many of the complaints are painless. The ulcers and the paralytic
        conditions are painless. Great physical and mental debility; great prostration of the
        muscular system; exhaustion, tremulous weakness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Paralysis of the legs and hip. Mental symptoms, nervous symptoms,
        trembling, in widows and widowers who have suddenly been deprived of their sexual relations.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When in a state of considerable vigor, if suddenly deprived, the woman or
        the man takes on a state of trembling weakness, inability to stand any mental effort, and
        inability to put the attention upon things said by others.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Not so marked or not so common in the woman as in the man. When this
        state comes on in a woman who is of unusual sexual vigor there may be severe congestion of
        the uterus and ovaries, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is more likely to fit her symptoms than </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. But with hysteria and excitability </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is often the
        remedy. Many of its symptoms come about from such a cause.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has such a deep
        action that it gradually brings about a state of imbecility. The mind gives out. The mind at
        first becomes tired like the muscles of the body. Unable to sustain any mental effort. The
        memory is weak.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind will not concentrate, it will not force itself to attention; it
        cannot meditate, and then comes imbecility. Inability to stand any mental effort or to rivet
        the attention upon anything are some of the most important symptoms in this medicine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Insanity of a periodical type. Imbecility, though, is far more frequent
        than insanity. When you come to examine the mental states you will see symptoms that will
        make you think the patient is delirious, but that is not quite it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a slow-forming weakness of mind; not that rapid, active state, such
        as accompanies a fever; it is a delirium without a fever, so to speak, which is not
        constant. Forms of insanity that are passive. He thinks slowly, and he continues in this
        stage for weeks and months, if he recovers at all.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Those excitable cases that have more or less violence and activity in
        mental states are such as will correspond to </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bell., </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Stram. and Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You see nothing of that in this medicine. This state of the mind has come
        on so gradually that the family has not observed it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind is full of strange things that have come little by little, and
        when the family look over the many things that he has done and said they begin to wonder if
        he is not becoming insane, but he is traveling toward a state of imbecility.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is of a slow,
        passive character. Complete indifference; takes no interest in anything, particularly when
        walking in the open air.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"He is averse to being near people and to talking of those passing
        him; is inclined to seize hold of and abuse them."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That, of course is an insane act.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sad and gloomy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Great unhappiness of mind, recurring every fourteen days," </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">showing a two weeks periodicity. The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient will sit and mope in the corner in a state of sadness and
        depression, giving no reason only that he is so sad.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A hypochondriacal subject going around with whims and notions that people
        attempt to reason him out of, and the more they attempt to reason with him, the more sad he
        is. Morose, peevish, vexed.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Every thing vexes and disturbs him. Cannot endure any kind of excitement,
        it brings on physical and mental distress, brings on weakness and sadness. Sometimes </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> symptoms will be found in persons who have suffered from grief; they become
        broken in memory. This is likely to come first.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They forge, never can recall things just as they want them. And so they
        grow weaker and weaker until they become imbeciles. If it is decidedly mental, imbecility
        results; if it is taking physical course the ending is paralysis, and it is not uncommon for
        general paralytic weakness to come on, so that body and mind progress toward weakness
        together until some decided manifestation is made, and then it will be seen to be going
        toward paralysis, or some decided manifestation is made which will send it toward
        imbecility, and then the body will seem to remain stationary.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There comes a time in these cases where there is a sort of division
        between the body and the mind. Whenever under homoeopathic treatment the physical, improves
        and the mental grows worse, that patient will never be cured. There are such cases. I never
        like to see the physical grow better and the mental grow worse in any degree.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That does not mean the aggravation caused by the remedy. If the mental
        does not improve it means that the patient is growing worse. There is no better evidence of
        the good action of a remedy than mental improvement.</p>

        endure even the slightest alcoholic drink.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Any wine or stimulating beverage will bring on trembling, excitement,
        weakness of mind and prostration. There are many headaches -in these patients. Patients
        going into decline will manifest headaches. Stitching, tearing pains in the head; throbbing
        in the head. Signs precursory to a giving out of the brain. Neuralgia.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Weakness of
        muscles. Weakness of muscles on one side of the face. Paralysis of the upper lids. Tingling
        pains. These are only in keeping with the signs of a general breakdown. We would not think
        of giving </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> for those sudden, violent congestions of the brain, or sudden,
        violent attacks of pain in the head, face or eyes, but those that accompany a general
        progressive disease.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are stitching, lancinating, knife-like pains along the course of
        nerves about face and eyes and head. Stitching in the top of the head. Burning on top of the
        head. Often the symptoms will lead the homoeopathic physician to make a physical
        examination. A great deal more important than the physical examination are, the symptoms
        that point out a remedy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Excitement will bring on headaches. Numbness of the scalp is one of the
        common symptoms of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. It is a general; wherever there is trouble there
        will be numbness, numbness with pains, very often numbness with the weakness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Paralytic conditions are attended with numbness. Sick headache with
        inability to urinate. Great giddiness. Everything in the room seems to go around. Confused
        feeling in the head. Often sits lost in thought.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Vertigo</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Vertigo and
        pressure in the head with unaltered pulse. Vertigo, worse from stooping. The slightest
        spirituous drink intoxicates him. Vertigo when turning the head, like turning in a circle,
        when rising from a seat; worse when lying down, </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">as though the bed were turning in a circle; when turning in bed</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">or when looking around.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        vertigo alone, but the general slowed down condition of the muscles. The paresis, or
