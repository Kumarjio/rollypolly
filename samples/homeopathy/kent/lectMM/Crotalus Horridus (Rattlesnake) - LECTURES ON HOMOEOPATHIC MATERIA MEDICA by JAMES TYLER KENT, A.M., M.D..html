        with something like horror upon their administration; but when they are properly used and
        when we consider the dreadfulness of the necessity demanding them, and also when we have
        ascertained that there can be no substitute when demanded, and again that they are
        potentized and changed until they are perfectly pure, because reduced to a state of simple

        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the case of snake bites we get the most dire effects; we see death
        itself, we see the ending after a very rapid course, the very highest type of zymosis. These
        snake poisons are supposed to be cyanhydrates of soda and other salts.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is known that alcohol is the natural solvent of the cyanhydrates, and
        because of this alcohol has been used in great quantities in snake bites, and it has
        frequently prolonged and even saved life. If he lives through the violent attack he goes on
        forever manifesting the chronic effects, and from these we have collected symptoms.</p>

It
        was bitten in the region of the neck, and in that region a large abscess formed every spring
        as long as that dog lived, until old age, when he died from that disease. The periodicity in
        the snake poisons is related to the spring, to the coming on of the warm weather.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        and low forms of blood poisoning, those cases that come on with great rapidity, breaking
        down of the blood, relaxation of the blood vessels, bleeding from all of the orifices of the
        body, rapidly increasing unconsciousness like one intoxicated and besotted in appearance.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        The body appears mottled, blue intermingled with yellow jaundice comes on with astonishing
        quickness, and the eyes become yellow, and the skin becomes yellow and mottled. Blue in

        in disease of the very lowest, the most putrid type, coming on with unusual rapidity,
        reaching that putrid state in an unusually short time. One who has been poisoned rapidly
        sinks into, this besotted, benumbed. putrid, semi-conscious state. There is a feeling as if

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Around the boil or carbuncle for many inches there is oedema, with

        pustule, and then several come and they are surrounded by little pustules and papules and

        The blood will not coagulate and the flow continues. Or in a woman during a typhoid fever
        menstruation comes on. It is not a true menstrual flow, that is, it does not resemble the
        ordinary flow, because it is copious, dark and liquid, a continuous oozing with all the
        grave symptoms described, and especially the besotted countenance, the comatose state, the
        appearance as if she were intoxicated, lying as one dead. When aroused every muscle
        trembles; if the tongue is protruded it trembles, and there is inability to articulate.</p>

        is unable to take care of his own accounts, for he cannot add up things that are at all
        particular. Sleep alternates with long and tedious periods of wakefulness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is disturbed by any change to warm weather. Great irritability,
        sensitive to spheres, easily disturbed by his surroundings, and easily wrought up into a
