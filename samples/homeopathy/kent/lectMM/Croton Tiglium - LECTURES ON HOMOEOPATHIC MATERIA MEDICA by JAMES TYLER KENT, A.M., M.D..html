        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> oil, when applied to the skin, produces both vesicles and pustules upon an
        inflamed base, and the part becomes very red and sore.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The inflammation often increases until it resembles erysipelas, but more
        commonly the eruption produced resembles a vesicular eczema. This eruption will come on for
        a few days and will then desiccate, and in a few days longer it will desquamate.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When one has been overdosed, as is done in a too prolonged proving, or by
        the crude drug, or when the prover has been markedly sensitive, we get an alternation of
        states, the internal alternating with the external.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After the eruption is out the internal manifestations are not present, as
        is seen in the rheumatic state, the cough and the bowel symptoms. If we study these groups
        separately we will find they are all interesting.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Cough</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: First, its
        cough. It has an asthmatic cough, coming on in the middle of the night, often arousing the
        patient from a sound sleep. Attacks of violent coughing, with dyspnoea and choking, worse at
        night and worse on lying down, compelling him to sit up, to be bolstered up in bed, or to
        sit up in a reclining chair.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">His friends wonder if he is not going into consumption. If it is a child
        they wonder whether it is not whooping cough. There is extreme irritation of the air
        passages, so that the inhalation of air brings on the cough. Sensitive to deep breathing.
        Now, this will go on for a while and finally he will break out with an eruption somewhere
        upon the body, vesicles and pustules, in clusters and patches, that become inflamed and red
        and finally dry up and desquamate and disappear, and then back comes his cough. This may go
        on as a chronic state, and when such is the case it will be very well to know this remedy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bowels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The next most
        important symptoms are the bowel symptoms, and perhaps they are the best known of any of its
        symptoms outside of the eruption. It is suitable in both acute and chronic diarrhoea. It is
        suitable in cholera infantum.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The marked feature is the extreme, suddenness with which the stool is
        ejected. It seems to come out in one </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">gush
        of yellow, watery</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">or pappy stool; soft, thin fæces, coming, out </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">with one gush</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">so<i> </i>marked is
        this that it is not an uncommon thing for a rural patient to describe it as </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"like that of a goose."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It all gushes out in one squirt.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mother says of the little patient:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"You would be astonished, doctor, at the violent rush, for it all
        comes out with one squirt."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is descriptive. Many remedies have a holding on and a prolonged
        effort at stool, until it takes quite a long time. Many of the diarrheas are prolonged with
        numerous little gushes of thin fæces or water, but this particular feature is striking.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It may not always be so, but this violent gush of thin, yellow faeces or
        yellow water is a striking feature of the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With this the abdomen is very sensitive, and is greatly distended; there
        is much gurgling in the bowel, and when the physician puts his hand upon it the patient will
        say he feels the gurgling, as if he were full of water, and it probably is so, for the
        expulsion of the stool would not occur in one strong gush were it not for the fact that the
        colon and rectum were full of fluid.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Another peculiar thing commonly attending </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton tig</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        diarrheas is that pressure over the abdomen or pressure about the umbilicus causes a pain in
        the rectum and urging to stool, and a feeling, with the expulsion of the stool, as if the
        rectum would protrude. Clinically it has been described as if the pain followed the
        intestines all the way down to the anus.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The taking of a little water, or of a little milk, what would ordinarily
        be suitable food for such a diarrhea, will at times cause an instant urging to stool; he
        must go to stool immediately after eating.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This gives the general features of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton tig</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. diarrhoea. If
        it is in an infant there is great exhaustion, tympanitic abdomen, much rumbling of the
        bowels, great sinking, and as soon as the infant takes one mouthful of milk or draws from
        the mother's breast it expels a gush of liquid or pappy stool.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Eyes</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Another most
        important group of symptoms is its eye symptoms. It has eye symptoms of an inflammatory
        character, and around the eyes and upon the lids are vesicles and pustules.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pustules upon the cornea, granular lids. Inflammation of all the tissues
        of the eye. It has an inflammation of the iris and conjunctiva. The blood vessels of the
        eyes are distended, the eye looks red and raw. The eyelids when turned out are seen to be
        greatly inflamed and granular, covered with vesicles and pustules.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With this inflammatory condition there is a sensation very commonly
        present in the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton tig</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. eye cases, as if the eye were drawn backwards by a
        string, or as if the optic nerves were dragging the eyes backwards into the head.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This drawing in the back of the eye as with a string is also peculiar to </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Paris quadrifolia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">but the conditions
        are different in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Paris quad</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In headaches from overuse of the eyes in engravers or those doing fine
        needle work, with much neuralgia in the head, due probably to the overuse of the eyes, when
        the pains in the eyes are not attended with inflammation, but are more of the type of dull
        aches and pains that you might call only rheumatic or neuralgic, with this sensation as if
        the eyes were drawl) back into the brain; in these neuralgic cases use </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Paris quad</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But in the inflammatory conditions such as I have described, with the
        same drawing back as with a string, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton
        tig.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Troublesome eczema of the scalp in infants, either purely vesicular or
        intermingled more or less with pustules. The vesicles dry up and then desquamate, and now
        there is a red, raw, inflamed surface, sensitive to touch.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After desquamation has pretty nearly finished, a new crop of pustules and
        vesicles comes out, and while one place is clearing off another is vesicular. This is how it
        goes on with a chronic eczema. The eruptions are often about the eyes, on the temples, over
        the face and on top of the head.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The appearance is so nearly like <i>Sepia </i>that the two very often
        cannot be distinguished. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sepia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">has the same vesiculation intermingled with pustules, the bleeding and
        rawness of the surface and the eruption of new crops.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sepia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is more
        frequently indicated in this raw and bleeding state of the scalp, in crusta lactea, or the
        eruption of children that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Crot. tig.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> Under </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton tig</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. infants in
        this state very often have attacks of gushing diarrhea, coming on from the slightest
        disturbance or indigestion; this is a great help in guiding to the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When the two groups of symptoms are combined, the scalp symptoms and the
        diarrhea, you can hardly make a mistake. You will see this also, that if the diarrhea is at
        all prolonged, the head will steadily improve and you will think your patient is getting
        well of the scalp trouble, but when the diarrhea slackens up a little out will come a fresh
        crop.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If the diarrhoea becomes chronic the external eruption will disappear,
        and if the diarrhea improves the external eruption gets worse. It seems necessary in such a
        constitution to have a vent. The mucous membrane is but the internal skin, and the
        integument of the body the external skin, and this remedy especially manifests itself upon
        one or the other of these, the mucous membrane or the integument.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Lactation</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It has
        another manifestation that you want to carry in mind, a group of symptoms in relation to
        lactation. After confinement the mother may go on a little while with all things following
        normally, but all at once she commences to have pains in one or the other mammary gland, and
        the drawing as with a string comes up again.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It feels to her as if a string were attached behind the nipple pulling
        backward, a sharp, drawing, stinging pain that will in some instances keep her walking the
        floor night and day.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Though it is but a little thing it is a very important symptom to know
        with </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton tig</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. We see this drawing, as with a string, in the eye and in the
        breast, and also the symptom, very like the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Plumbum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> symptom, drawing
        in the naval upon pressure, somewhat like a string.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Associating such things together will enable you to understand them as a
        part of the nature of the remedy and to keep them in mind. I once cured a woman of this
        painful drawing from the nipple as with a string. I watched her walk the floor and saw that
        the suffering must be very intense, for at times it brought tears to her eyes. She had borne
        it several nights, which shows that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton
        tig.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is capable of curing a pain that is
        very prolonged or tedious.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The breast had been poulticed, hot applications had been put upon it, and
        they did not give relief, a point which is worth remembering.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In cholera infantum, we will naturally have the symptoms of vomiting,
        which, however, are not so common to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Croton
        tig.,</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> although it has some vomiting, So
        in cases of cholera infantum, in which the vomiting is not so important a feature as the
        loose bowels, the remedy may be </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Crot. tig</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A symptom is reported that is of great value. Excessive nausea with
        vanishing of sight, vertigo, worse after drinking, with frequent discharges of
        yellowish-green water from the bowels; excessive nausea, much water in the mouth. So we note
        the excessive nausea and not so great vomiting.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The nausea is more like that of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ipecac</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, but in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ipecac</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">we have nothing
        like the stools of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Crot. tig</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., we have only scanty little gushes, every minute a

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is true that remedies that are relieved by scratching are more nearly
        antidotal to such remedies as are relieved by scratching. The more similar the better; but
        medicines will antidote each other when they are similar only in general character, and they
        will cure disease when they are similar in general character.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is also true that medicines while they are not similar in general
        character may be similar enough in special localities to remove the symptoms in these
        localities, while the disease will go on. The remedy in this case is not similar enough to
        cure the disease, but it has removed some of the symptoms. That is the most miserable kind
        of a prescription, as it changes the manifestations of the disease without changing its
        nature. In that way, a very poor prescription may hunt around and get one remedy for one
        group of symptoms and another remedy for another group, and the patient be worse off than
        before. If the remedies are similar as to their general nature, then the little superficial
        symptoms are not so extremely important.</p>
