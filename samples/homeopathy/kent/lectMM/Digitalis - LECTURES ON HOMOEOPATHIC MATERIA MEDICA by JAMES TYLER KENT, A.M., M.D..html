        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">History</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This drug as
        used by the Old School has done more mischief than any one drug in their Materia Medica.
        Every patient who had a fast heart, or anything the matter with the heart, was given </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has caused more deaths than any drug. If administered when the heart
        is going fast it will soon produce a peculiar kind of paralysis; the heart then having lost
        its balance-wheel, compensation gives out, the patient sinks and finally dies.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They do not know that many patients would have lived through fevers,
        pneumonia and other acute diseases if it had not been for this medicine, used as they have
        used it in the tincture, in many-drop doses, until the heart was slowed down.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">They call it sedative; yes, it is a sedative. It makes the patient very
        sedate. You have seen how very sedate a patient looks after he has been in the hands of an
        undertaker and has on his best garments. That is what </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> does. In that
        way it is a sedative in the hands of the allopath. A homoeopathic physician never prescribes
        to bring down the pulse. He prescribes for the patient and the heart's action takes care of
        itself.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        poor fever medicine. Instead of being indicated when the pulse is fast, the proving says it
        is indicated when the pulse is slow. The allopath gives it when the pulse is fast to make it
        slow; if given to a well person it will make the pulse slow, and when indicated in a sick
        person the pulse is slow.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tenderness about the liver-but during that time the pulse is slow. It
        makes the bowels very sluggish, produces inactivity of the liver, and stools are bileless,
        light colored, putty-like-and the pulse is slow.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Add to that jaundice and you have a grand picture of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: jaundice with slow pulse, with uneasiness in the liver, pale stool, and

It seems as if be would
        die, and he does not get better from eating. It is a nervous, deathly sinking that comes
        with many heart troubles.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You would not be surprised to find in Digitalis much nervous prostration.
        Restlessness and great nervous weakness.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Feels as if would fly to pieces.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Anxiety.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Feels that something is going to happen."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Seems as if his whole economy were full of anxious feelings and
        restlessness. Lassitude, faintness exhaustion and extreme prostration. Faints on the
        slightest provocation. It begins in the stomach; an awful sensation of weakness in the
        stomach and bowels.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Sleep</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: His sleep is
        full of horrible dreams, nightmare, fright. Dreams of falling, that is very common with
        cardiac affections. When the pulse is too slow, when it is irregular, the brain is
        irregularly supplied with blood during sleep, and there is a turbulent state.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A shock goes through the body like an electric shock, like internal
        jerkings, twitchings. Sudden muscular movements, as if a current of electricity passed
        through the body. This, with slow pulse, with a sense of faintness, and great weakness.
        Bluish paleness of the lips in persons who suffer at times with cardiac spells - it seems at
        times as if the pulse would cease. Face becomes blue, the fingers become blue. Wants to lie
        on the back. Frequently startled in sleep; jerking at night.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The heart symptoms are numerous, but none is so important as the slow
        pulse. The pulse is slow in the beginning of the case. It may now be flying like lighting.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pulse</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: He is anxious,
        restless, has horrible dreams and sinking in the stomach - that sounds like the advanced
        stage of Digitalis - but I want to know if in the beginning, the pulse was slow.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The patient himself seldom knows, but someone says that in the beginning
        the pulse was 48; that is </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. If the pulse in the beginning was rapid do not think
        of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, for it will not do any good.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> pulse is at first slow and perhaps remains so for
        many days, until finally the heart commences to go with a quiver, with an irregular beat,
        intermits, feels as if it would cease to beat, and then we have all these strange
        manifestations.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Weakness is the very character of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> pulse, and all
        these characteristics go along with it. First it is slow, and sometimes strong. Slow, strong
        pulse when rheumatism is threatening the heart.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Violent. but not very rapid pulse.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sudden violent beating of the heart, with disturbed rhythm."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The slightest motion increases anxiety and palpitation. When the pulse is
        going very slow, sometimes down to 40, the patient turns the head and the pulse flutters and
        increases in its action. If he turns over in bed it seems as if the heart would stop. If he
        moves he feels it fluttering all over him, and it settles back and is slow again; but,
        finally, it changes and flutters all the time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Palpitation of the heart originating in grief. Sudden sensation as though
        the heart stood still. Fluttering of the heart, The least muscular exertion renders the
        heart's action labored and intermittent in a feeble heart.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Cough</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: A person with
        an enlarged liver, with a slow pulse, with jaundice and pale and stool. With that he will
        have a troublesome cough. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is not much of a remedy for a cough unless it is a
        cardiac cough.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Cough at midnight. Cough, with expectoration of "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">boiled starch</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">." Cough, with expectoration of bloody mucus in hypostatic congestion
        of the lungs.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cough, brought on by talking, walking, drinking anything cold, bending
        the body. These are coughs associated with other troubles.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Respiration</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The same
        thing is to be said of the respiration. There are difficulties of respiration, along with
        cardiac troubles and liver troubles.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Respiration irregular and performed with great difficulty.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Constant desire to take a deep breath.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When he goes to sleep the breath seems to fade away, then he wakes up
        with a gasp</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">. <i>Lachesis, Phosphorus,
        Carbo veg.</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i> </i>and some other
        remedies have that; remedies that affect the c<i>e</i>rebellum particularly, producing a
        congestion of the cerebellum.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When a patient goes to sleep the cerebrum says to the cerebellum:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Now you carry on this breathing a little while, I am getting
        tired."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the cerebellum is not equal to the occasion. It is congested, and
        just as soon as the cerebrum begins to rest the cerebellum goes to sleep, too, and lets the
        patient suffer; and in that way we get suffocation. The cerebellum presides over respiration
        during sleep and the cerebrum presides over respiration when the patient is awake. We might
        learn that from the provings of medicines if we never found it before.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Fear of suffocation at night."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, to analyze that. He knows from experience that every time he drops
        into a sleep he suffocates, and hence he fears to go to sleep for fear he will suffocate.
        The fear of suffocation at night is from this origin. It is the same if he falls asleep in
        the day time.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Can only breathe in gasps."</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a useful
        medicine when there is a filling up of the lower part of thy lungs. The patient is sitting
        up in bed, and there is dullness in the lower part of each lung and plenty of resonance in
        the upper portion. Then it is, if he lies down, he will suffocate. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Digitalis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> likes
        mostly to lie flat on the back with no pillow, when there is no filling up of the lungs. But
        when there is hypostatic congestion he suffocates. If early in the case the pulse was slow
        and it has become fast, Digitalis may be of some benefit.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Urinary organs</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Now, a

        <p align="JUSTIFY">In many instances where the catheter has been used for months or years
        because he is unable to pass urine in a natural way, and where there is a residuary urine in
        old bachelors and old men, Digitalis is a good remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It diminishes the size of the prostate gland and has many times cured.</p>
