        <p align="JUSTIFY">When we examine its spasmodic nature, its exhaustion, its cramps, which
        extend through a large number of complaints, we must realize that it is a more extensive

        coughing, at which time the face becomes red, congested, and purple like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bell</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.

        coughs come often during measles or after an attack of measles. An irritation in the larynx
