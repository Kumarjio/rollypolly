        <p align="JUSTIFY">All through the Eastern States, in the rural districts, among the first
        old -settlers, Boneset-tea was a medicine for colds. For every cold in the head, or running
        of the nose, every bone-ache or high fever, or headache from cold, the good old housewife
        had her Boneset-tea ready. Sure enough it did such things, and the provings sustain its use.
        The proving shows that Boneset produces upon healthy people symptoms like the colds the old
        farmers used to suffer from.</p>

        sometime before the attack, and there are sometimes spells of vomiting bile. About seven or
        nine o'clock in the forenoon, he commences to shudder, the shivering runs down the back and
        spreads from the back to the extremities; he has violent thirst, but the shiverings are mad
        worse from drinking so that he dare not drink cold water. There is soreness and pulsation in
        the back of the head, violent pain in th occiput and back before and during the chill.
        During the chill he wants to cover up and the clothing needs to be piled on.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The thirst extends through all the stages. At the close of the chill
        there is vomiting; often it does not occur until the heat, but before the sweat fairly sets
        in, he vomits copiously, first the contents of the stomach and then bile. When the heat is
        on he seems to burn all over, sometime as though with electric sparks.</p>

        and very scanty sweat. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">The bones ache as <i>if

        it stings, it burns; he describes the headache in terms expressive of violence, as if
        probably a congestive headache. One would think after the fever subsides and he commences to
        sweat a little that he would get relief, which is true excepting the headache, which often
        gets worse clear through to the end of the attack, and. sometimes it will last all day and

        the more the liver becomes engorged, and finally the urine is loaded with bile, the stool
        becomes whitish, the fever increases, the nausea increasing, the tongue becomes pointed and
        elongated, and is dry, the headache is extremely painful, and a state of masked fever comes

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The time for the administration of this dose is at the close of the
        paroxysm. You get the best effect when reaction is at the best, and that is when reaction is
        setting in, after a paroxysm has passed off. That is true of every paroxysmal disease, where
        it is possible to wait until the end. You cannot mitigate them very much during the attack,
        indeed, if the medicine is given then it very often increases the difficulty, but if you
        wait until the close of the paroxysm you get the full benefit of your medicine, and the next
        paroxysm will not develop, or will be lighter, or, if another attack is brought on
        immediately you may rest assured there will be no more.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is not an uncommon thing in intermittent fever, when the remedy has
        been administered at the close of the paroxysm, for the next paroxysm to come within
        twenty-four hours after the administration of the medicine; these mixed cases are often in a
        state of disorder.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">One who does not know this would immediately show the white feather,
        would be alarmed, would be afraid the patient was getting worse, but you have only to wait
        for the subsidence of the attack and you will see that you have broken its cycle and

        has also a chronic constitutional state, viz.: its gouty nature. It is a very useful
        medicine in gout. It has gouty soreness and inflamed nodosities of the finger joints, of the
        elbow joint, pain and gouty swelling of the great toe, red tumefaction of the joint of the
        great toe. It establishes, in persons who are subject to chalk stone deposits around the
        finger joints. These gouty subjects take cold, the bones ache, the joints become inflamed,
        the patient will say he is chilly, the skin becomes yellow, the urine is charged with bile,
        the stool becomes whitish, and he becomes weak.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In many instances these patients have been for years resorting to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Burgundy</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> for relief of their gouty joints and the weakness. Some one of our
        homoeopathic remedies will relieve the suffering, but in those old gouty subjects who have
        been always drinking wine, you cannot take the wine away from them at once; you cannot do it
        while they are having the attack, because they have become so accustomed to it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Burgundy</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is the kind

        take it away from him. What has been his custom must be followed out for a while because he
        would grow weaker, but it is damaging him, and hence it is difficult to contend with gouty
        subjects who have been taking stimulants. You do not get the full benefit of Homoeopathy and
        you cannot stop his stimulants because weakness will follow. Persons who have not taken wine
        as a regular beverage can and should do without it, as it interferes with the action of the
        homoeopathic remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These gouty patients have terrible sick </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">headaches</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Pain in the base of the brain and back of the head,
        associated with gouty joints. These are often referred to as </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">arthritic headaches</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">that is, gouty
        headaches, headaches associated with painful joints. Or the headaches may alternate with
        pains in the joints. Congestive headaches, the pain being in the base of the brain, with
        more or less throbbing; the pain spreads up through the head and produces a general
        congestive attack.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Sometimes these headaches come on when the joints are feeling better, and
        the more headache he has the less pain he has in the extremities; and again, when the gout
        affects the extremities, then the headaches diminish. Headaches, having a </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">third and seventh-day aggravation</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">coming with more or less periodicity.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With the headache there will be nausea and vomiting of bile, nausea at
        the thought and smell of food. This gouty individual is also subject to vertigo, and the
        sensation as if he would fall to the left is especially noted with the coming on of the
        headache. The vertigo comes on in the morning; when he gets up he feels as if he would sway
        to the left, and he has to guard himself in turning to the left. Sometimes in intermittent
        fever this symptom of swaying to the left and vertigo ending in nausea and vomiting, violent
        pain in the back of the head and pain in the bones, are the first threatenings.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We have in this remedy also other gouty manifestations: shooting through
        the temples, shooting from the left to the right side of the head; shooting all through the
        head; stitching, tearing pains in the limbs as well as the bone aches.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The headaches are so violent that they make him sick at the stomach. In
        gouty headaches, in intermittents at the close of the intense heat, in periodical headaches,
        the course is the same, the pain is so intense that nausea is soon brought on and then he
        vomits bile. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Eupatorium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has not been used on its symptoms in gouty states as
        often as it might have been. In intermittent fever it is well known; in headaches it is only
        occasionally used.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Only occasionally does a man realize its great benefit in headaches and
        in remittent fevers. In gouty and rheumatic affections it may be suited to the symptoms and
        is more useful than is generally known. It is not the purpose of our talks to point out
        ultimates of disease. I do not look upon gout as a disease, but as a great class of symptoms
        of a rheumatic character that occur in the human family; a great mass of symptoms that may
        be called gouty, a tendency to enlargement of the joints and gouty deposits in the urine.
        The ordinary so-called </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">lithaemia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a gouty constitution.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The gouty state of the economy is the superficial or apparent cause; the
        real cause rests in the miasm. So when I speak of gout I do not mean the name of a disease,
        but a class of manifestations that are met in large cities especially, less frequently in
        the country where the people live on farms and take plenty of exercise and have wholesome
        food and are not housed up. It is supposed to be due to wine drinking. Often when I say to
        patients that the symptoms arc somewhat gouty, they reply,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"I am not in the habit of drinking wine. I have not been a high

        extremities, in the badly treated case, it is very difficult to find what medicine to
        administer, and the course that the homoeopath must pursue is to go back and examine the
        patient to find the symptoms he had at the time of the intermittent fever, before he was
        meddled with. If now there is swelling of the extremities, and you get symptoms to show you
