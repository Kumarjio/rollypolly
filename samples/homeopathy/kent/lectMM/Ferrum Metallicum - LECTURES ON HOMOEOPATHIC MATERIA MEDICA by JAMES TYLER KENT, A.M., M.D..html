        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Iron</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: We will take up
        the study of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum metallicum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. The Old School has been giving Iron for anaemia
        throughout all tradition. They have given it in great quantities in the form of the tincture
        of chloride, and the carbonate.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Whenever the patient became anemic, pallid, waxy and weak, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Iron</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        was the tonic. It is true that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Iron</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> produces anemia, and it would be astonishing to any
        one who ever read the provings of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> of the allopaths did not create additional
        bloodlessness with the doses of Iron they administer.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is true that under the provings, and under those circumstances where
        Iron has been given in excess, the patient becomes greenish, waxy, yellow and pallid, with a
        sickly and anemic countenance. The lips become pale; the ears lose their pink color; the
        skin of the body becomes waxy, and there comes a tendency to hemorrhage, at times with
        clots, but commonly with copious, thin, liquid blood, very dark.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The clots will separate and the fluid parts look brown, dirty and watery.
        The patient gradually emaciates. He is pallid and waxy; his muscles become flabby and
        relaxed; he is incapable of endurance. All the muscular fibers become tired from any
        exertion. Rapid exercise, or, any unusual exertion. is impossible. Any rapid exertion or
        motion brings on weakness, dyspnea, sinking and fainting.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A strange thing running through all the constitutional conditions of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is that the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">pains and
        sufferings come on during rest.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The palpitation sometimes comes on during rest, the dyspnoea comes on
        during rest, and even the weakness. The patient is ameliorated by moving gently about, but
        any </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">exertion tires</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and causes faintness.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Any </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">rapid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">motion aggravates the complaints. The pains are ameliorated by moving about
        the house slowly, so that the exertion does not excite or fatigue. In many cases the patient
        is dropsical. The skin pits upon pressure and is pale, yet the face shows an appearance of
        plethora. From every little excitement the face becomes flushed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">During the chill the face becomes red. From taking wine or stimulant the
        face becomes flushed, and the patient, though flabby, relaxed and tired, does not get credit
        for being sick.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She fails to get the sympathy of her friends. She is feeble, she suffers
        from palpitation and dyspnoea, she has great weakness with inability to do anything like
        work, she feels that she must lie down-yet the face is flushed. This is called a
        pseudo-plethora.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The blood-vessels are distended, the veins varicose, and their coatings
        relaxed. On this account bleed ing takes place easily; capillary oozing; hemorrhage from all
        pass of the body, haemorrhage from the nose, the lungs, the uterus.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Women suffer much from haemorrhage from the uterus, especially during and
        after the climacteric period. Ferrum will be found of great value when the symptoms agree in
        that wonderful anemic state called "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">green
        sickness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," that comes on with girls
        at the time of puberty and in the years that follow it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There will be almost no menstrual flow, but a cough will develop, with
        great pallor. So common is this sickness among girls that all mothers are acquainted with
        and dread it. In a large practice you will have a number of cases of chlorosis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes the early menstrual period is attended with a copious, and then
        occurs, and this goes on for a number of years before anything like menstrual regularity is
        established.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In these cases the Old School always used to feed their patients </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Iron</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        in great quantities, but the more Iron the patient took the worse she grew.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Congestion, tending upwards, with red face, hot head and coldness of the
        extremities. But the heat of the head and face is not at all in proportion to the red
        appearance. It will be found that this congestion upward in Ferrum will take place during a
        chill, in septic fevers or in other forms of fever, and the head is not always hot, but
        sometimes cool. The face may be red and cool.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Another grand
        feature of Ferrum is that, like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, it has complaints from loss of animal fluids; from
        prolonged haemorrhage, with weakness remaining a long time. There is no repair, no
        assimilation. The bones are soft and easily bent; they take on crooks. Emaciated and feeble
        children. Dryness of the joints, causing cracking on motion. Sudden emaciation, with false
        plethora.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Redness of face - a healthy looking bloom - in one who is unable to walk
        fast on the street, or to stand any exertion. Yet some of the complaints of Ferrum are
        better from occupation, from doing something, from taking a little exercise, because the
        complaints come on during rest.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Over-excitability and sensivity of the nerves; oversensitiveness to pain.
        The sensitive woman who needs </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has a flushed face and is often complaining because
        she gets no sympathy. She does not look sick, yet she puffs on going up stairs; she feels
        weak and wants to lie down.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Restless when keeping still; must keep the limbs moving. Rending pains in
        the limbs; dull aching in the limbs. These pass off when moving about quietly and gently,
        like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pulsatilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. But </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a very cold remedy, and is ameliorated by warmth,
        except the pains about the neck, face and teeth, which are ameliorated by cold. But most of
        the pains are ameliorated by heat; the patient wants to keep warm and dreads anything like
        fresh air or a draught.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Weakness and prostration; weakness even from talking. Prostration with
        irregular pulse and rapid pulse, or with too slow pulse; palpitation. And then comes
        paralytic weakness; the limbs give out. Paralytic conditions from anaemia or haemorrhage.
        Fainting spells from haemorrhage. Jerking and twitching of the muscles; chorea; catalepsy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: You may easily
        imagine something of the character of the mental symptoms, for they are like the physical.
        The mind is confused and the patient tearful. Depression of spirits; mental weariness and
        depression. The highest degree of depression and despondency. Anxiety from the slightest
        cause; irritability.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The least noise, like the crackling of paper, sets the patient wild. It
        brings on nervous excitement and restlessness; she must get up and move.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Excitement from the slightest opposition. Any sudden or rapid motion, or
        the least hurry, causes blackness before the eyes; dizziness; things turn in a circle; she
        must sit down. And with all this the face is red. When alone and at rest, the face becomes
        pale and cold, but the least excitement brings a flush to the cheeks.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Headaches</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        headaches are congestive in character, with mounting of blood upwards. There is a sense of
        fullness and distension, with red face.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Fullness and distension of the eyes; fullness of the neck. Palpitation of
        the heart. Exophthalmic goitre. The headaches are ameliorated by pressure. Ferrum wants to
        be pressed to support the veins. Throbbing like hammers in the head.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Every quick motion aggravates the headache. Coughing aggravates the
        headache; pain in the head and </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">occiput
        from coughing</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These pains are sometimes ameliorated by walking
        gently. Going up stairs, sitting down, rising from a seat unless it is done very
        deliberately - will arouse all the pains of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Any sudden motion will bring on hammering and a feeling of great
        expansion in the head. And then will come more or less shooting, tearing pains. Beating in
        the back of the head from rising or from coughing, because coughing is a sudden motion.
        Confusion of mind with hammering headache. Rush of blood to the head. Congestive headaches
        from excitement; from taking cold; from exposure; lasting three or four days or a week. The
        face is gushed and perhaps cold, the head somewhat hot, but not as hot as would be expected.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Redness of the eye; engorged vessels. Great weakness, dyspnoea and
        palpitation. Writing - a mental operation - causes the headache to reappear. Great
        sensitiveness of the scalp. The patient must let the hair hang down. Mental disorders and
        headaches accompanying or following haemorrhages, and in lying in women.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Bloated appearance about the eyes. All sorts of disturbance of vision
        from congestion. Venous stasis; swelling of the eyelids; pus-like discharge.
        Over-sensitiveness to sound; ringing in the ears.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The symptoms of the nose are numerous. Colds and catarrhal troubles,
        ending in nosebleed. Nosebleed on slight provocation, with headaches at the menstrual nisus.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Scabs form in the nose. Extreme paleness of the face; face becomes red
        and flushed on the least emotion. Flushed face with dropsy of the lower limbs; flushed face
        with chill. Thirst during the chill is a striking feature of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. During
        the menstrual period there are violent pains, and as soon as the pain starts the face
        becomes flushed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Nothing taken into the stomach digests, and yet there is no special
        nausea. It is the exception to find nausea in Ferrum. Food goes into the stomach and is
        vomited without nausea-simply emptied out. Sometimes there are eructations of food by the
        mouthful, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phosphorus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Food</font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">: Phosphorus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">was<i> </i>the remedy with all the old masters for spitting up of food by
        the mouthful until. the stomach was empty.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Canine hunger. It says in the next:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Double the amount of an ordinary meal in the evening was hardly
        sufficient."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">All food tastes bitter; solid food is dry and insipid. After eating there
        are eructations. Heat in the stomach; </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">regurgitation
        of food</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Spasmodic pressure in the stomach after the least food or drink,
        especially after meat. Aversion to meat, to eggs, to sour fruit. Aversion to milk, and to
        his accustomed tobacco and beer. Sweet wines agree, but sour wines and all sour things
        disagree. The tongue feels as if burnt. As soon as the stomach is empty vomiting ceases
        until he eats again. Vomiting of food, immediately after midnight, Vomitus tastes sour.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pregnancy</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">: Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is occasionally indicated during pregnancy. A few
        weeks after becoming pregnant the woman commences to throw up her food by the mouthful.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is no nausea, but the face is flushed and the woman is flabby and
        weak. She vomits without becoming sick. Fullness and pressure in the stomach; pressure in
        the stomach after eating. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is an unusually interesting remedy because of this
        peculiar stomach. It is like a leather bag; it will not digest anything. Fill it up and it
        empties itself just as easily as it was filled.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ferrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has a
        troublesome diarrhoea, with acrid watery excoriating stool. Morning diarrhoea. Many of these
        patients are old sinners with broken-down constitutions, who have suffered long from
        constipation. Chronic constipation with ineffectual urging and hard, difficult Stools.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Relaxation runs through the remedy. From this relaxation there is
        prolapsus of the rectum, vagina and uterus. Dragging down in the lower part of the body, as
        if the organs would come out-and sometimes they do come out.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Bladder</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The bladder
        is also relaxed. Its sphincter is weak, and there is no regularity of its muscular action.
        Hence, we have involuntary urination from sudden motion, from walking, or from coughing. In
        little children the urine dribbles all day just as long as the child plays the urine
        dribbles and keeps the clothing wet, but this better while keeping perfectly quiet.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bladder is so relaxed and tired that it cannot hold the urine, and as
        soon as it is partially filled it allows its contents to escape. This relaxation runs
        through the remedy and gives it character, just like a human being. You know what each one
        of your friends is likely to do on every occasion. So it is with a remedy. You ought to know
        what it is most likely to do, in order to know what it will accomplish in curing the sick.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Genital</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Weakness and
        relaxation of the genital organs is common to Ferrum. The menstrual flow comes in for its
        share. Copious, watery flow; haemorrhage or suppression - amenorrhoea - no flow at all, only
        a leucorrhoea. Suppression of the menses with great nervous excitement; with flushed face;
        with weakness and palpitation. Prolapsus of the vagina. Insensibility of the vagina during
        coition. Metrorrhagia. Menses too soon too profuse and lasting too long.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Respiration</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Difficult
        respiration; pains and disturbances in the chest. Difficult breathing, with a sense of a
        great load on the chest. Suffocating fits at night; catarrhal conditions of the respiratory
        tract; congestion of the chest; dyspnoea.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Spasmodic cough, such as we find in whooping cough, coming on in violent
        paroxysms. Cough after every meal, with gagging, emptying the stomach of its contents. Cough
        felt in the head. Cough worse from the abuse of brandy, tobacco or tea. Cough coming on
        after the loss of fluids, as after haemorrhages.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chest troubles following uterine hemorrhage, and after other hemorrhages.
        Coughing up blood; bleeding from the lungs. Persons debilitated by secret vices, with a
        tendency to go into tuberculosis.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Palpitation of the heart from fear, excitement, or exertion. Rapid action
        of the heart, or sometimes slow action. Fatty degeneration of the heart. Pulse accelerated </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">toward evening</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Pulsations

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Rheumatic pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: in
        the extremities, ameliorated by heat and by gentle motion; aggravated by cold, by exertion,
        or by rapid motion. Pains through the deltoid muscles are spoken of more prominently than
        pains in other parts, but these pains are no more striking than the pains anywhere in
        Ferrum.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Tearing pains through the limbs. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Inability to raise the arm; paralytic pains</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, - that is, pains that are benumbing.
