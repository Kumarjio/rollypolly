        <p align="JUSTIFY">It takes a long time for this remedy, in the proving, to develop its
        symptoms. It is a very deep-acting medicine, and an antipsoric, antisyphilitic and
        anti-sycotic.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is insidious in its action and its symptoms are slow in approach; it
        is like the deepest and slowest and most tedious diseases, the miasms, and hence it is
        suitable in the very slowest and lowest forms of disease.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">While it has in its nature some febrile action, it is not for this
        purpose that it is oftenest called for its most typical febrile action is very slow and
        insidious. It corresponds to overheated states of the system, old cases of nightly fevers,
        coming on week after week and year after year.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is an unusually hot-blooded remedy at times, and again it has
        conditions of coldness. In the evening and night great heat seems to evolve from the body
        without increase of temperature. The skin becomes very hot.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That patient is often &lt; from warm things, &lt; from covering, &lt;
        from warm air; suffocates somewhat like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. in a warm room. He wants to bathe the face and head
        in cold water; such bathing is grateful.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The feet burn and are put out of bed in the night; he hunts around in bed
        for a cool place for the feet and bands. The soles perspire, and the palms perspire, and the
        sweat is acrid, making the parts sore; excoriation from the sweat between the toes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The perspiration is offensive; offensive, acrid sweat between the toes.
        Burning, unusual heat and acridity are words that modify a great many symptom s; an acrid
        lachrymation or other discharge from the eye; acrid discharge from the nose, acrid sweat,
        etc.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensation of burning and burning pains in parts; heat evolved from the
        body as a chronic state. Aggravation from heat, from outward heat and from inward heat,
        belongs to this remedy. It is a strong feature, of this remedy to be worse from drinking tea
        and coffee. Warm, drinks bring on a diarrhea, or flatulence, or disturbance in the stomach,
        and cause indigestion to manifest itself in various way The symptoms are worse standing and
        sitting and better in the open air.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a remedy of great depth of action. It so disturbs the functions
        that there are peculiar outward signs in the nails, in the hair, in the skin; they are all
        imperfectly developed.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Whenever such is
        the case, we know that a remedy has great depth of action and that it is very long acting.
        It forms like incrustations here and there upon the skin that seem to have no tendency to
        heal.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A crust forms, but there seems to be no healing beneath the crust. The
        hair loses its luster; it falls out, and if examined closely under the microscope it is seen
        to be necrosed; little ragged ulcers will be found along the course of the hair.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The ends of the hair are dry, the hair mats and splits and breaks,
        becomes ragged in masses and lustreless. The nails are crippled, likewise corrugations in
        the nails; the nails grow too fast and grow awkwardly; that is, they are deformed and
        crippled, too thick in some places, and too thin in others; break easily, brittle.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a tendency to breaking down of a slow character, where the
        circulation is very feeble and the skin is near bone or cartilage as in the cartilages in
        the ears, and in the cartilages of joints.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Ulcers develop over the tibia. There is feeble circulation in the hands
        and feet and they become cold. In the evening the extremities burn and are feverish, because
        that is the time of the feverish state; but in the morning and in the daytime there is
        coldness of the extremities.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is pallid and sickly, and at times becomes waxy and
        dropsical; oedema of the extremities, and particularly of the lower extremities; oedema of
        certain parts; oedema of the prepuce.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When a debilitated subject, one suffering from bone and cartilaginous
        troubles, contracts gonorrhoea, with it he will have enormous swelling of the prepuce, and
        nothing seems to act upon it. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Fluoric
        acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will cure oedema of the prepuce with
        gonorrhoea in such a subject. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cannabis

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Fluoric acid</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will
        prevent the manifestation of disease in sycotic subjects, will prevent formation of fig
        warts. It cures fig warts. It produces hardened, dry warts, and dry crusts upon the skin,
        and crusts not unlike rupia. It is useful in syphilitic rupia.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Bone affections stand out prominently. Necrosis, especially of the long
        bones, but also of the bones of the ear. It creates an offensive acrid discharge from the
        ear. It establishes an offensive oezena, an acrid discharge, with necrosis of the nasal
        bones.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is very analogous to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., and it is one of
        the natural followers of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. where </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has been too
        frequently repeated by persons who do not know that Silicea does its best in a single dose
        and that it is a long acting and slow medicine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It not only antidotes the abuse of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., but also follows </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.,
        After practicing a while you will be surprised to observe the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Pendulum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> like
        -action between beat and cold in various complementary remedies.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">To make that clear I will illustrate it by using the series in which this
        remedy is set and to which it naturally belongs. You take a patient who is hot-blooded, who
        is always suffering from the heat, from too much clothing and too warm a room especially in
        the evenings, a patient that is tearful and sad, and may be a blonde.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Why you say, I am trying to describe a Pulsatilla patient. Well, yes;
        anyone can see that. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is a hot-blooded patient, but after using that
        remedy a while you notice that the patient goes to the other extreme and becomes chilly, and
        wants much clothing; the heat is taken out of the case. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is the natural
        follower of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., and you would be astonished to know bow often a patient leaving </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        runs toward </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. goes deeper into
        the case, it does more cutting, and it is the, natural chronic of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Other
        remedies of course follow </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., but </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. more frequently than
        any other medicine. Now, that is the second step; the patient has gone from a warm to a cool
        state; the overheated state has been lost and he has gone into </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., but when </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        has been administered for a while it cures the cold state, and removes the chilliness of the
        patient (remember, however, that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has at times something of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. in it; in
        some of its complaints it is &lt; from being overheated) and the patient under </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        goes back to the warm state again, becomes hot-blooded, wants the warm covers thrown off,
        wants to be lightly covered.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Then it is that this medicine comes in the series. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Fluor. ac</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. follows </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. as naturally as </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. follows </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.

        other remedies that exist in threes, but the most common ones you will think of will be:</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Do not let these facts make you give a routine remedy unless the symptoms
        agree, but it does help to remember that remedies are somewhat similar. It is true that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls., Sil. and Fluor. ac</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. are similar all along the line as to the nature of their

        more acute disturbances, or to the earlier stages of chronic disease, the more active or
        violent operations of chronic disease. It will take off the wire edge of the disease, and it
        will be followed by some medicine that is complementary to it, always to be determined by
        the symptoms that arise.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There are cases that would be greatly injured by so deeply acting a

        unnecessary; but if you commence with </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Puls</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. you can mitigate the case and prepare it to receive </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sil</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.,

        has been constant use of the brain it is suitable.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a state in which a man is never satisfied with one woman, but
