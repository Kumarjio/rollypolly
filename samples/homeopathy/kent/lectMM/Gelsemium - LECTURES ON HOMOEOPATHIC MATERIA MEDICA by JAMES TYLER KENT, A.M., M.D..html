        mostly in acute troubles. In lingering acute troubles and in those resembling the chronic it
        is very useful, but in chronic miasms it is not the remedy. It is only a short-acting
        remedy, though slow in its beginning. In this it is like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bryonia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bry</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">complaints come on slowly, and hence
        it is suitable for fevers coming on in the southern climate, but it also has sudden violent
        complaints, though not to the extent we find in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bell</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Complaints</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        complaints of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. are largely congestive. Cerebral hyperemia,
        determination of blood to the brain and to the spinal cord. The extremities become cold and
        the head and back become hot. The symptoms are manifested largely through the brain and
        spinal cord. In connection with brain affections there are convulsions of the extremities,
        crampings of the fingers and toes and of the muscles of the back.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Coldness of the fingers and toes; sometimes the extremities are icy cold
        to the knees, while the head is hot and the face purple. During the congestion the face is
        purple and mottled. The eyes are engorged, the pupils dilated (sometimes contracted), the
        eyes are in a state of marked congestion with lachrymation and twitching.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient feels dazed and talks as if he were delirious; incoherent,
        stupid, forgetful. It is like this in intermittent fever that gradually develops towards a
        congestive chill. Great coldness running up the back from the lower part of the spine to the
        back of the head. Shuddering, as if ice were rubbed up the back.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains also extend up the back. With the coldness of the extremities,
        the very dark red countenance, the dazed condition of the mind, the glassy eyes and dilated
        pupils, we have the neck drawn back and rigidity of the muscles of the back of the neck, so
        that the neck cannot be straightened, and there are violent pains up the back and coldness
        in the spine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This state would remind one of cerebro-spinal meningitis. Pain in the
        base of the brain and in the back of the neck. With all states there is a very hot skin and
        a high temperature, with coldness of the extremities. Sometimes the troubles are ushered in
        with a violent chill.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a very important remedy to study when such symptoms are present
        in intermittents and in a few days the tongue begins to coat, nausea comes on, ending in
        vomiting of bile, and instead of there being an intermission a continued fever extends from
        one paroxysm into another, with a higher temperature in the afternoon.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The chill practically subsides, leaving a state which has the appearance
        of typhoid, with dry tongue, not much thirst and marked head symptoms, dazed in mind. If
        this continues many days delirium and all the features of typhoid will come on and the fever
        will change its type altogether from the intermittent to the continued.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In congestive chill with high temperature occurring in the afternoon, the
        chill part of it subsiding and the fever becoming continued, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is a
        useful remedy. It is also a very important remedy in afternoon fevers without chill in
        infants and in children. You will find in malarial districts that it is a common thing for
        the infants to have remittent attacks, while the adults are having intermittents. it is only
        occasionally that you will see a child or infant shake with a distinct chill, but they often
        go into a remittent fever, an afternoon fever which will subside along towards morning, to
        be followed the next afternoon by fever. With </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. the child will lie
        as still as in </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bry</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">but there is more congestion to the head there is the dark red face and
        duskiness like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bry</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></i></p><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Running through the febrile complaints, in the spinal meningitis, in
        congestion of the brain, in intermittents or remittents that change to a continued fever,
        and even in a cold when the patient is sneezing and has hot face and red eyes, there is one
        grand feature, viz., a feeling of great weight and tiredness in the entire body and limbs.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The head cannot be lifted from the pillow, so tired and so heavy is it,

        are worse. He has an aversion to motion, because he is conscious that it would cause an
        increase of suffering.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The heart is feeble and the pulse is feeble, soft and irregular. There is
        palpitation during the febrile state. Palpitation, with weakness and irregularity of the
        pulse. There is a sense of weakness and goneness in the region of the heart, and this
        weakness and goneness often extend into the stomach, involving the whole lower part of the
        left side of the chest and across the stomach, creating a sensation of hunger, like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ignatia and Sepia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. There is a hysterical element running through </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. and it has
        the nervous hunger, or gnawing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        endocarditis, and a remedy that will take hold in endocarditis and root it out must be a
        deep acting remedy. He feels that if he ceases to move the heart will cease to beat.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headaches are of the congestive type. The most violent pain is in the
        occiput, and it is felt sometimes as a hammering. Every pulsation is felt like the blow of a
        hammer in the base of the skull. These headaches are so violent that the patient can not
        stand up, but will lie perfectly exhausted, as if paralyzed from the pain. There is an
        occipital headache that compels walking or rolling the head.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is commonly relief from lying in bed, bolstered up by pillows, with
        the head perfectly quiet The face is flushed and dusky and the patient is dazed. After the
        headache progresses a while, the whole head seems to enter into a state of congestion, there
        is one great pain, too dreadful to describe, and the patient loses his ability to tell
        symptoms and appears dazed; lies bolstered up in bed, eyes glassy, pupils dilated, face
        mottled, and extremities cold.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has also
        headaches of a neuralgic character in the temples and over the eyes, with nausea and
        aggravation from vomiting. The headache is relieved by passing a copious quantity of urine;
        that is, the urine which has probably been scanty becomes free and then the headache
        subsides.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is much nervous excitement. Complaints from fear, from
        embarrassment, from shock that is attended with fear, from sudden surprises that are
        attended with fright. A soldier going into battle has an involuntary stool; involuntary
        discharges from fright and surprises accompanying fright. On becoming suddenly overwhelmed
        by some surprise he becomes faint, weak and exhausted, he becomes tired in all the limbs and
        unable to resist opposing circumstances. His heart palpitates. This is similar to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arg. nit. Arg. nit</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. has the peculiar condition that when dressing for an opera a sudden attack
        of diarrhea comes on, causing more or less sudden exhaustion, and she must go several times
        before she can finish dressing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">They who are to appear before an audience are detained because of a
        sudden attack of diarrhoea. A lady has an attack of diarrhoea when about to meet friends
        over whom she expects to become excited at the meeting. The anticipation brings on the
        diarrhoea. Such a state is </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Arg. nit</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. These medicines are so closely related to each other
        that there are times when they will appear to do the work of each other.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Then we have paralytic affections of the sphincters, and so with the
        febrile conditions there is involuntary loss of stool and urine. There is also paralytic
        weakness of the extremities and of the hands. With paralytic states there is aching along
        the spine and in the muscles of the back; drawing, cramping in the muscles of the back and
        aching under the left shoulder blade.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are many disturbances of vision; double vision, dimness of vision,
        appearance of a gauze before the eyes; confusion of vision and blindness. These symptoms
        come on before going into attacks, in connection with chill, at the coming on of sick
        headaches and congestive headaches. All sorts of objects are seen; the field of vision
        appears full of black spots, or full of smoke or little waves of various colors. It is
        useful in inflammation of all the tissues of the eye and of the eyelids. The eyeballs
        oscillate laterally when using them.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Drooping of the eyelids or ptosis is a marked feature and is in its
        paralytic nature.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The muscles are relaxed, they do not hold the lids tip. The lids close
        when he is looking steadily; they simply fall down over the eyes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient in general is thirstless, and it is the exception that there
        is much thirst. It has a profuse, exhaustive sweat and is aggravated from motion, or rather
        motion seems to be impossible. It seems that he is unable to move, that be is too weak to
        move, and this runs through all complaints. At times it is a remedy for coryza, with
        sneezing and running of water from the nose, with coldness in the extremities, and the
        trouble will go down into the throat and produce sore throat, with redness, tumefaction,
        enlargement of the tonsils, hot head and congested face.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">With this, as with the other febrile conditions, there is heaviness of
        the extremities. The red face, the heaviness of the extremities and sore throat that has
        come on gradually, a little worse from day to day, until it has become a severe throat, will
        lead you to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., especially if there is paralytic weakness all over, and as the
        throat trouble progresses the food and drink come back through the nose.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is due to a paralysis of the muscles of deglutition. The tongue also
        becomes paralyzed and don not perform its work in an orderly way. There are times when the
        paralytic weakness is not sufficiently marked to account for things seen, but there is an
        incoordination of muscles and he is awkward. He undertakes to, take hold of an article and
        takes hold of something else. When he does grasp his hands feel weak. He is awkward and
        clumsy and the muscles do this and that and something not ordered to do.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The trembling incoordination and paresis are especially noticed during
        high excitement and afterwards, and these states occur with the febrile condition and remain
        sometimes after. Useful in paralytic cases that begin with fevers. Tearing is felt in the
        nerves all over the body and seems to be due to an inflammatory condition. It has cured
        sciatica, with tearing pains, associated with great weakness of the limbs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Loss of sensation is sometimes found; numbness of the end of the nose, of
        the ears, of the tongue, of the fingers, of the hands and feet, numbness, here and there, of
        the skin.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the male, the sexual organs arc in the same condition as the patient
        in general. The semen dribbles away; there is impotency, no ability to perform the sexual
        act; the sexual organs are relaxed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The sleep is greatly disturbed. He cannot go to sleep; every excitement
        keeps him awake. During marked febrile conditions he has a profound sleep or coma. When he
        is not in this comatose sleep during congestion he is in a state of nervous excitement in
        which he lies awake thinking, and yet thinks of nothing in particular, because his!mind will
        not work in an orderly way.</p>

        or ovaries, stomach, the lungs and of the rectum. It has congestion of organs, but it has
        also high grade inflammation. There is nothing peculiar in the inflammation itself that
        would indicate </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., neither should </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Gels</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. ever be given
