        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Head</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The most common
        feature in this remedy is the surging of blood to the head and to the heart. A patient often
        describes the state as a feeling as if all the blood in the body must be rushing around the
        heart, with a sense of heat or a boiling sensation in the region of the heart, or in the
        left side of the chest.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Again he complains of a surging in the head, a warm glowing sensation in
        the head or a feeling of intense glowing from the stomach or from the chest up into the
        head, attended at times with loss of consciousness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are also wave-like sensations in the head, as if the skull were
        being lifted up and lowered, or as if it were being expanded and contracted. Along with this
        there is most intense pain, sometimes as if the head would burst, sometimes great soreness
        in the head, or a sense of soreness felt in the skull. Another accompaniment of the surging
        is great throbbing, synchronous with the heat of the heart, and when the skull has this
        soreness then the throbbing is like the beating of hammers, and every pulsation is painful,
        so that there are painful pulsations and sometimes painless pulsations.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pulsations are tremendous and when they are greatest in the head they
        are felt also in the extremities. The fingers and toes pulsate, there is pulsation
        throughout the back, and it seems that the whole body throbs. If this continues a while the
        soreness in the skull is likely to come on and with it the painful throbbing, every throb is
        a pain. In this state, with every jar in stepping, and every motion, it seems as if the head
        would be crushed.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Throbbing</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        throbbing becomes more painful from motion. The vomiting which attends this condition
        relieves. The head is relieved in the open air, it is worse in the warmth, and is often
        relieved from the application of cold. It is made worse by lying down, or lying, with the
        head low. In the extremities we have great coldness. The extremities cold, pale and
        perspiring, the head hot and the face flushed and purple or bright red. The pupils are
        dilated and the eyes red. Now, if this progresses only a little while, the tongue becomes
        dry, red and then brown. There is no great thirst, but the mouth is very dry. The eyelids
        become dry and stick to the eyeballs. At times the skin becomes dry and hot, and the face is
        red and glistens. All degrees of confusion of mind, even loss of consciousness, will be
        present.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        described to a great extent that which is seen in a typical sunstroke? It is noticeable also
        that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Glonoine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> symptoms are worse in the heat of summer and relieved in winter.
        The dull headaches and the continuous headaches are aggravated from warm weather and
        ameliorated from cold.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">They are worse in the sun and better in the shade. All sorts of
        contrivances will be resorted to by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Glonoine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patients to keep the sun's beat from the head. When
        he has had these troubles for years, and it has become a chronic state, he will never go out
        in the warmth of the sun without an umbrella.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Glonoine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> corresponds
        to congestive states in the head that come on suddenly, especially from heat, but also from
        gaslight, or from any bright light.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headaches that book-keepers are subject to, especially in those that
        have at their desk, or over the head, a hot gaslight. The bright light accompanied by the
        heat so close to the head will make this individual subject to headaches. These headaches
        are relieved by going into the cold air. The head aches all day when he is at his books, and
        when he goes home at night and lies down the headache comes on again, and he bas to be
        bolstered up in bed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He wants the head high, and cold applications to the head; the headache
        is relieved from a long sleep, not generally relieved from siesta. From lying down and
        taking a nap the headache is sometimes aggravated, but from a good long sleep, a night's
        sleep, he is refreshed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">His feet and hands become warm, the feverish state, and the throbbing all
        over the body subsides and he wakes up in the morning comfortable; but if he goes out in the
        sun, or goes to the gaslight, he comes home with the headache again. Since electric lights
        have been brought into use there is not so much heat in the light, but gas throws out an
        immense amount of heat in its light,</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The child comes down with cerebro-spinal meningitis, the neck is drawn
        back, the face is intensely hot, red and shiny, the eyes congested or glassy, the head and
        upper part of the body are very warm, the feet and hands and lower portions of the body and
        the extremities are cold and covered with cold sweat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a most violent congestion to the brain and spinal cord. Convulsions
        come on, convulsions throughout all the limbs, the neck and whole body drawn back,
        opisthotonos. Cold feels good to the head; heat feels good to the extremities. The warm room
        increases the convulsions. When the lower limbs are covered with clothing in a cool room and
        the windows open the convulsions are relieved and the patient breaths more easily. With this
        head congestion there is difficulty in breathing and audible palpitation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The head is made worse from shaking or jar, from stooping, from bending
        head backwards, after lying down, when ascending steps. It is aggravated in damp weather,
        and in the sun, while working under the gaslight, after overheating with copious sweat, and
        from the touch of the hat.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The weight of the hat is a very common aggravation in headaches in school
        children. The little ones work all day in a hot stuffy room and feel better in the open air,
        but the weight of the hat seems an encumberance as in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Nitric acid and Calc. phos</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        and from mental application. When the headache is on he cannot think, and he cannot write.
        An additional hindrance to writing is that he trembles so that he cannot write. Trembling
        and throbbing of the fingers so that he is unable to do his work or perform any delicate
        work with the fingers or hands.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We have puerperal convulsions with such an appearance as I have
        described. We may have the same violence in congestive chills, or in any type of congestion
        of the brain.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Brain</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There is a
        milder form of trouble that calls for its use, a condition corresponding to the chronic
        types of disease. This milder form exists where the patient has simply what might be called
        a hyperemia of the brain, a rush of blood to the head when able to be about. It comes in
        spells, comes in moments when be least expects it; while walking on the street he feels a
        surging to the brain like a flush of heat and a flush on the face, his hands tremble, and
        the hands and feet become cold, he breaks out in a sweat; he looks around him and does not
        know which way to go home, he does not know where his dwelling is.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He looks in the faces of friends and they seem strange, he loses his way
        when be is near home. It is a confusion which soon passes away, and he feels better again.
        But these spells come closer together, and constitute the earlier stages of softening of the
        brain. This surging of blood to the brain is attended with dizziness; he rolls and staggers,
        and must take hold of things, and especially does he suffer in this way from a warm day, or
        from the heat and light of the sun.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In threatened apoplexy, and when apoplexy has taken place, if the violent
        pressure keeps on, think of this remedy. The clot may not be at first in the place to take
        life, it may be outside of the life line, but if the congestion continues that blood clot
        will increase.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Such medicines as </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Glonoine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> relieve the
        blood pressure when the symptoms agree. They equalize the circulation, and the patient may
        not die. A paralytic condition in one arm or leg may go on for a while, and at the end of
        many weeks or months the motion may be regained, and the patient recover; whereas if the
        suitable remedy had not been administered to reduce that blood pressure the continued
        congestion would certainly have ended in death in a few days.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The stertorous breathing, the coma, the history, and the general
        appearance of an apoplectic patient are found in this remedy, but the intense heat that
        comes on in many cases of apoplexy along with the shiny skin and coldness of the extremities
        are the guiding features.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is the most
        frequently indicated medicine, but it must not be administered in large doses. The highest
        potencies are the best and one single dose is enough.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In a case noted it says, "frantic attempts to jump from the
        window."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The headache was so intense that the patient became violent and attempted
        to jump from the window. You may rest assured that with his headache there was all this
        determination of blood to the head. It is enough to make one frantic to feel this continued
        hammering upon every fraction of the skull. He cannot lie down, and he cannot walk, because
        every step increases the jar, so you see why it is that the word "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">frantic</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">" is wed there. The patient becomes frantic with the pain.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another expression used is "disinclination to step around."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient wants the room perfectly still. If sitting up in bed, you
        will often find a Glonoine patient with both hands pressing upon the head with all the power
        possible until the arms are perfectly exhausted. He wants the head pressed upon all sides.
        Wants it bandaged, or a tight cap fitted down upon it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headache is worse from bending backward and from stooping forward.
        There are times when the headache is so severe that lying back upon the pillow cannot be
        tolerated. There is a sense of great heaviness in the head. You will notice, in reading over
        these congestive headaches as reported, that each patient has a different way of describing
        his headache and yet all have the same story to tell, that of violent determination of blood
        to the head.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Some months after being violently jarred by being thrown from a
        carriage, a sensitiveness of the upper part of the back and neck came on."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There are two strong characteristics of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Glonoine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in that
        cure, viz:</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"&lt; from wine and the &lt; from lying down."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The other symptoms might have pointed to other remedies, but these two
        features are there. It is interesting when reading a case, if you have first a knowledge of
        the Materia Medica, to note what symptoms are verified when you do not know the Materia
        Medica then the case is confusing.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, as we glance over that description we see at once these two things
        verified and the rest is fairly consistent. Very commonly the pain begins in the occiput and
        goes to the forehead, but the whole head is in a state of throbbing.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">But, we notice more particularly, the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">"aggravation from motion and the least noise</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This patient will sit in perfect quietude and silence for hours. You will
        be astonished to, know how long a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Glonoine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient can sit without moving a muscle, because
        motion is so painful.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Also "aggravation from lying with the head low and after
        sleeping." </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">it is important for you
        to know what that sleeping means. As I have said before, the patient very often is worse
        after a little sleep, but the common state is relief after a prolonged sleep. If he can
        sleep long enough it will subside, unless it be the congestive sleep, or coma, and then it
        is a different thing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Amelioration from cold and external pressure."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Vertex burning hot, likewise upper part of back."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The whole crown of the head feels as if it were covered by a hot iron, as
        if an oven were close by. Hot, especially in the back of the neck and between the shoulders.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The burning heat seems to appear at the top of the head and extend down
        between the shoulders; a sensation of heat, as from a band.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Face bluish, with a heavy, stupid expression."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The face is bright red, but if the condition becomes severe the face
        assumes a dusky appearance, and the longer this state lasts the more dusky it becomes; that
        is true with apoplexy and also with sunstroke. When the sunstroke first comes on the face is
        bright red, intensely hot and shiny, but as the heat increases the face grows dusky, even to
        purple. In all of these cerebral congestions there is a stupid, heavy expression, even going
        on to coma.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Frequent deep inspirations."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With this congestion of the head there is commonly vomiting, palpitation
        of the heart, pain in the stomach, great difficulty in breathing and finally loss of
        consciousness. In another clinical case reported we read:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Every pulsation is felt as if the head would burst."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, suppose the head bones were already intensely sensitive and sore and
        the head filled as full as possible with blood, and then you commenced hammering upon the
        blood column you can understand that the pain would be most intense and would soon end in
        stupefaction.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sunken eyes, bluish pallor under the eyes."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Red eyes, with photophobia; optical illusions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Black specks before the eyes; blindness."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Face pale, in spite of high fever."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In all of these cerebral congestions of great violence the pulse
        fluctuates; it even becomes fine and wiry and hard; sometimes becomes irregular and also
        slow.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Another common accompaniment of these congestions is tumefaction about
        the neck. The neck feels full. The collar must be opened as it causes choking, as if he
        would suffocate. Even in the chronic state in the one who stands upon the street corner not
        knowing his way home because of the surging of blood in the head, that state is accompanied
        by choking and the collar causes uneasiness about the neck like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lach</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He chokes and swells up under the ears. There is not
        only a sensation, but with the sensation there is actual swelling. Tumefaction about the
        neck and throat, under the chin, and the glands become swollen.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The next circumstance in the text that brings forth the general aspect of
        the remedy is in connection with the catamenia. The menstrual flow does not appear, it is
        delayed, with violent congestion to the head, violent headaches and these symptoms already
        described. These congestions may also come on during the menstrual period. Again, if a
        uterine hemorrhage stops suddenly, or a copious flow from any part stops suddenly, the
        patient comes down with great violence and the blood rushes to the head.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are many conditions and complaints in life where we have surging of
        blood to the head, when this will be the remedy wanted. Persons who are subject to
        palpitation with dyspnea, upon any effort, he cannot go uphill, he cannot walk along the
        pavement without bringing on palpitation and dyspnea; any little exertion or excitement
        brings on the rush of blood to the heart and fainting spells; fainting, spells in women, who
        are not supposed to be subject to fainting. Great weakness, palpitation, trembling of the
        limbs, shaking of one or both hands as with palsy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Laborious action of the heart" is a strong feature of the
        remedy; pulsation all over.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Fluttering in the region of the heart. Pulse quick, irregular, slow or
        quick and wiry. There are some persons that are apparently plethoric; very much affected by
        the slightest exertion and who have pulsation all over; pulsation in a warm room. They are
