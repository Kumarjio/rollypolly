        morbidly fat, or have been fat and are now emaciating; with constipation more commonly than
        diarrhoea; in women in these conditions whose menstrual habit is pale, late, short and
        scanty; catarrhal discharges that are albuminous and viscid represent to the mind some
        peculiar general states of the sick man not explainable and not common to diseased
        conditions nor to many remedies; hence, strange, rare and peculiar. Raw surfaces upon the
        skin are generally marked by such viscid glutinous discharges.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a very deep acting remedy, like all carbons, and is accompanied
        with induration and burning in the base of the ulcers, inflamed tissues and old cicatrices;
        hence, its great usefulness in cancerous growths and ulceration.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Cancerous development in old cicatrices is a strong feature of this
        remedy. Contraction of tendons, especially behind the knee. It has hemorrhagic oozing of
        pale blood. In the higher sense the patient is anaemic and chlorotic. From eruptions,
        catarrhal discharges, menstrual flow, ulcers, breath and perspiration there is marked
        offensiveness (like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Carbo v.,

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Modalities</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The
        patient is very sensitive to cold and needs warm clothing; he is sensitive to the cold in
        winter and to the heat in summer; he is sensitive to a warm room and desires open air which
        is grateful. Worse in a warm bed; complaints come on from becoming cold or heated; the
        headaches are worse in a warm room and better in the open air. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Graphites</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has
        cured deep seated spinal complaints, and in such cases the patient delights to lie heavily
        covered in a cold draft from an open window.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is easy to see in this, the resemblance to <i>Carbo veg., </i>which
        often cures when the patient wants to be fanned. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Craving for air is strong in the carbons</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">yet often easily

        becomes ill from being overheated; exertion makes all symptoms worse.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Motion increases all symptoms except the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">numbness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and general feeling of stagnation which come on during
        rest. Extreme weakness. Weakness and desire to lie down. Paralysis in any part but
        especially in the lower limbs; sensation of paralysis or stagnation creeps over the body and
        limbs.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is made sick by bathing and is sensitive to cold, damp weather. What
        there is in the general life to cause eruptions to come out in the bends of the joints must
        be left for others to explain, but such is the case with this wonderful remedy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Convulsions</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The same
        may be said of rawness and excoriation in the same regions. Cataleptic conditions are very
        marked in which the patient is conscious but without power to move or speak; tremulous
        sensation throughout the body; sudden sinking of strength; sudden weakness. Constriction in
        many parts. It has cured many kinds of convulsions. It is not the remedy for the convulsion,
        but in chronic sickness where the convulsion is but one of many elements it is often
        suitable. It has cured epilepsy and hysterio-epilepsy and epileptiform spasms many times
        when the totality of symptoms furnished the basis for the prescription.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A careful comparison of the symptoms shows that this remedy acts
        predominantly on the left side of the body. The patient is oversensitive to pain and outer
        parts are very sensitive.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The pains are </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">burning</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">drawing, pressing.
        Soreness. Stitching and tearing. Numbness is more characteristic than pain. The formation of
        fissures in all the commissures and in the anus with cracked and bleeding skin in many parts
        with much hardening; the tendency to grow wens on the scalp and elsewhere are features of
        this remedy not to be overlooked, and when coupled with the mental symptoms form such a
        strong and striking image of perverted vital action that the neophyte should not overlook </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Graphites</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The patient
        becomes very restless when attempting close mental work and there is a marked dread of
        mental work. The mental depression is extreme, and it is made worse by music; her sadness is
        so great that she thinks only of death and salvation. Grief and vexation cause of recurrence
        of all her distressing mental sufferings.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        morning; often excited, hurried and exhilarated in the evening; extremely fretful and
        impatient; irritable about trifles and very critical. Irresolution is a marked symptom.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She cannot make, up her mind to do or not to do. Extreme activity of mind
        in the evening and first half of the night, which, prevents sleep until midnight;
