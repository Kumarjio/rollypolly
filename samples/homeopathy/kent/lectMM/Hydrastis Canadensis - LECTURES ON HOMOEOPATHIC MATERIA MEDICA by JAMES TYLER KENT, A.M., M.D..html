        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hydrastis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a slow,
        deep acting remedy, required in many trophic disturbances. where there is emaciation,
        catarrhal conditions and ulceration, even malignant ulceration. Defective assimilation.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When it is noticed that the stomach is the center of most of the symptom
        complex. The desires and aversions often give the key to a very complex totality of
        symptoms. In this remedy the sinking empty hunger with loathing of food is striking,
        strange, rare, and therefore Peculiar. It is characteristic because it is a general of the
        remedy, and is predicated of the patient. Great weakness prevails at all times.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Catarrhal symptoms with thick, viscid, ropy, yellow mucus, sometimes
        white, from any mucous membrane, with or without ulceration. Deep eating spreading ulcers
        upon the skin or mucous membrane, with thick, viscid, yellow pus. Induration in glands, in
        base of ulcers. False granulations that bleed much and easily, on the slightest touch.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy has been very useful in the treatment of malignant ulcers. In
        such ulcers it is often a great comfort to the patient, even when it does not cure, as it
        removes the offensiveness, modifies the pain and restrains the destructiveness.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The burning so commonly found in such ulcers is a strong symptom of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hydrastis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. When the weakness and emaciation have progressed together for months and
        years in chronic stomach disease, fainting comes on, and this is also found in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hydrastis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. In chronic cases, when the tissues have suffered and not the mind.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The astonishing absence of mental symptoms except the general
        discouragement incidental to long suffering and weakness is striking. If it were carefully
        proved, most likely the mental loves and hates would come out. The symptoms are better
        during rest. Small wounds bleed and suppurate.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The headaches are only such as generally belong to stomach disorders, and
        prolonged nasal catarrh. They are not distinctive. It has cured eczema with thick crusts.</p>

        covered with scales; fissured behind where connected with head.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        agree. In old cases when enemas no longer act, when the faeces remain high up, or do not
        come down into rectum to excite desire, this remedy has been of great service. In
