        cutting pains in the stomach and below the stomach, going from left to right. The cutting
        pain in colic goes from left to right. The patient is unable to stir or breathe until that
        pain passes off. It holds him transfixed in one position, coming like the stabbing of a

        rapidly into the chest. With these colds in the nose there is copious bleeding of bright red
        blood. Every time he takes cold in the nose he has copious bleeding; a tendency to nosebleed
        with the colds. The inflammation that comes upon the mucous membrane in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ipecac</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is violent.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The irritation comes on suddenly, and the mucous membrane inflames so
        rapidly that the parts become purple, turgescent, and bleeding seems to be the only natural
        relief. Stoppage of the nose and loss of smell; the nose becomes so stuffed up that he
        cannot breathe through it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With the head symptoms, with the colds, with the whooping cough, with the
        chill, and with many of the inflammatory complaints, the face becomes flushed, bright red,
        or bluish red, and the lips blue; with the chill the lips and the finger nails are blue. The
        chill is violent, sometimes congestive in character and often a rigor. The whole frame
        shakes, and the teeth chatter.</p>

        It is useful in cases of humid asthma, in cases of asthmatic bronchitis, when they suffer
        from the damp weather and from sudden weather changes; every little cold rouses up this
        bronchial attack, and he suffocates and gags when he coughs, or spits up a little blood.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
