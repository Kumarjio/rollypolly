        out of sleep. He will wake up with various symptoms and remain awake until 5 o'clock in the
        morning, and after that to a great extent they are relieved.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course, there are plenty of sufferings at any time in the twenty-four
        hours, but this is the worst time. He wakes up at 3 o'clock in the morning with fear, fear

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Whenever he goes out in the cold air, the nose opens up and the mucous
        membranes become dry and burn; when he returns into a warm room the nose commences to
        discharge, and the nose stuffs up so that he cannot breathe through it, and then he feels
        most comfortable; so that it has stuffing up of the nose in a warm room, and opening up of
        the nose in the open air. When the nose is open so that he can breathe through it, that is
        the time the head is most painful; it is painful to the cold air and the cold air makes it
        burn.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The cold air feels hot. All these patients suffer from a chronic catarrh
        and when they ride in the wind the catarrhal discharge ceases and then will come on a

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Whenever the discharge ceases from taking cold in a draft on comes
        headache, and as the discharge becomes free again the headache is relieved. Neuralgic pains
        in eyes and scalp and through the cheek bones from a cessation of chronic catarrhal
        discharge, and when the discharge starts up again, these pain cease.</p>

        a chronic catarrh will also have the discharge in the morning, which will fill up the nose
        with yellow mucus. In the morning he blows out and hawks up dry, hard crusts that fill up
        the nasal passage, clear over into the pharynx and down into the throat.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These crusts become dry as if they were partly formed upon the mucous
        membrane and when they are blown out there is bleeding. The bleeding starts from where the
        crusts are lifted up. He is subject to sore throat, is always taking cold, and it settles in
        the throat. He is also subject to enlarged tonsils and with these has enlargement and
        chronic hardness of the parotid glands-one or both. Great knots below the ear, behind the
        jaw.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These grow and become hard, and at times, painful; shooting, darting
        pains when he is moving about in the open air. When air strikes these enlarged glands they

        long time, there is a break in the constitution, there is something radically wrong.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Similar symptoms are observed in the woman. In spite of the fact that the

        copious and frequent pollutions, nightly dreams, sexual prostration. Young men who have
        abused themselves, or who have indulged excessively in sexual pleasure, go into marriage
        with weakened genitals, incapacitated; and then there comes a disgust, and it is not strange
        that there are so many divorces in the world. When the patient is young, some of this
