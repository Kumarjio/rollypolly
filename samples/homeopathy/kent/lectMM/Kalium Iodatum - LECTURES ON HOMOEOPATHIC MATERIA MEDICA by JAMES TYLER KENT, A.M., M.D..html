        extensively by the old school as an antisyphilitic, but in the very large doses which they
        used it became to a great extent allopathic to the disease, because of the tremendous effect
        it produced upon the economy, and implanted its own miasm, and thereby in a measure it
        suppressed many cases of syphilis.</p>

        sustain in homoeopathic relation to the disease in general, and of these the very smallest

        the increasing of the dose does not make it homoeopathic. There is an idea in vogue that
        increasing the dose makes the remedy similar. That is going away from principle. If the
