        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generals</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The symptoms
        that indicate this remedy show themselves especially in the muscles, in the tendons, in the
        joints, along the course of the nerves, in rheumatic complaints.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The pains
        change about, wandering pains, and they axe aggravated from motion. The sharp pains spread
        from the centres to the extremities, the wandering pains go downwards, down the arms, down
        the back and down the legs; from the shoulder to the fingers, and from the hips to the toes.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These pains sometimes shoot like lightning, again they tear along the
        nerves, along the sciatic and crural nerves, down through the calves. In rheumatic
        constitutions the pains are dull, tearing, crushing and pressing, and are aggravated by
        motion and go from the lower to the upper limbs. Motion will bring on the pain or aggravate
        it when it is present. The head pains are very severe. They often begin in the back of the
        neck or back of the head, and extend to the top of the head. There are also pains in the
        front of the head, pains over one or both eyes, tearing neuralgic pains aggravated by heat
        and motion.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains come and go with the sun, that is, they begin in the morning at the
        rising of the sun and increase till noon, then gradually decline and disappear at sunset. He
        is incapacitated for mental work when in motion and even when sitting up, but, when lying
        upon his back perfectly quiet, making no motion, the mind works well and with clearness;
        with the slightest motion, however, even of the hand, on comes vertigo and confusion of
        mind.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Moving about disturbs makes him incompetent. The pains are also worse the
        first half of the night. With these symptoms there is cardiac trouble of rheumatic origin.
        The condition has increased until organic disease has come, even hypertrophy of the heart
        and valves.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Heart</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This remedy has
        cured that state. Palpitation very marked when lying on the left side, &gt; when lying on
        the back, sometimes &gt; when sitting erect, &lt; when bending forward.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These symptoms alone cause this remedy to stand out in relief. It is
        useful in rheumatic patients where syphilis is at the bottom, syphilitic rheumatism that has
        taken the course described until finally the heart has become affected and there is
        thickening of the valves. Shooting pains through the heart, pains in the chest, intermittent
        pulse, pulse skipping a beat now and then.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Either the arterial or venous system, or the valves of the heart, or
        both, may be affected. Dyspnoea from any kind of exercise, cardiac dyspnoea. You have <i>in </i>this
        a remedy for such complaints. It goes to the bottom in old cases of rheumatic syphilis, and
        has cured many a cardiac complaint that was the result of syphilis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will be guided to it especially if the pains wander from place to
        place, and if they go from above down wards, if they go from the shoulder down toward the
        fingers, from the hips toward the feet, or down the spine. It is also suitable in old cases
        of gonorrhoeal rheumatism when the symptoms agree.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The slightest motion, the slightest effort or exertion brings on the
        vertigo, and this is due to disturbance of the circulation. The heart <i>is </i>so
        susceptible to any exertion that disturbance of the circulation of the blood in the brain
        comes on from the slightest motion.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"In a recumbent posture mental faculties and memory perfect, but, on
        attempting to move, vertigo."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If the patient persists in moving, nausea and vomiting will follow. It
        has palpitation, shaking the whole frame, audible, vehement palpitation. He cannot lie on
        his left side.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is suitable in old, troublesome, recurrent headaches associated with
        cardiac affections. A headache will come on daily if the sun comes out, but it will not come
        on if the day is clouded. He is aggravated from the light of the sun and the increasing
        brightness of the sun's rays.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In addition to these there are paroxysms of pain that are nightly. These
        are the bone pains, pains in the shin bones as if the periosteum would be torn off; these
        pains come on at night, or the first half of the night. It is well known in syphilis that
        the &lt; is at night. It is an antipsoric, antisycotic and antisyphilitic, it can be
        selected when the symptoms agree with any of the three miasms. Pains in the pericranium,
        pains in the bones nearest to the surface. In bed at night the pains become very severe and
        last all night.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This night aggravation, is especially true of the marked antisyphilitic
        medicines. It is found under </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hepar </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and <i>Mercurius</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>; </i>but in none of the remedies do we find it so strikingly manifested
        as in the disease, or miasm, syphilis itself.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In syphilis the &lt; comes with the setting of the sun. It is one of man’s
        enemies that does its work in the night. Many of the complaints of sycosis conform to the
        day hours, and the pains are &lt; from the rising. to the going down of the sun.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Medicines also have such I queer whims. We must study remedies as we
        would human character. Some of them seem to be extremely whimsical, and it is by knewing
        these whimsical, strange and peculiar things that we are able to mark the character of the
        remedy, When we know these peculiari ties we have found the circumstance under which the
        remedy Works</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Kidneys</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: There are

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">All the organs are related. to each other but especially the heart and
        kidneys. When the kidneys are not working well, the heart is very often troublesome. All
        through the varying forms of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bright’s</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> disease the heart is troublesome.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Difficulties of breathing, difficult heart action, with albuminuria. It
        will relieve the breathing. Again, associated with kidney affections, we have many eye
        complaints, difficulties of vision, and these also especially call for this remedy. It is
        often indicated in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Bright's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> disease, with disturbance of vision, occurring during

        or during albuminuria, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kalmia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> becomes a remedy,</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is useful in neuralgia; neuralgia of the eye, neuralgia of
        the face, violent, tearing pains in the face. Sometimes it takes the form of a nightly &lt;
        and sometimes it takes the form of daily &lt;. The aggravation in the daytime comes and goes
        with the sun. The &lt; at night time comes with the lying down.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Anxious expression of countenance" associated with rheumatism
        of the heart.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Flushing of the face, with vertigo."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After the disappearance of a herpetic eruption, violent neuralgic pains,
        shooting, tearing pains in those nerves that supply the part where the eruption was. When
        shingles, ring-worm, cold sore, or isolated vesicular eruptions disappear, suddenly from
        some violent cause or inappropriate treatment, or from catching cold, violent neuralgias
        come in their place and continue until the eruption comes out again.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy becomes suitable if the symptoms agree; that is, if the whole
        patient is in agreement with the state of the remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains are stitching and tearing, very severe, sometimes cutting and
        shooting when this remedy is mw useful. The pain will seem to take hold of a nerve and will
        hold on to it for many minutes, Coming with violence, coming suddenly and letting loose
        suddenly. Pains come in the extremities in the same way, taking hold as if the nerve were
        being pinched by nippers, or as if it were being torn to pieces.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"There, now it is gone!" says the patient.</p>

        </i>I<i> </i>remember a patient, an old syphilitic, who was told if he ever made a violent
        move he would die, the valves of his heart were so badly affected. He had all the murmurs
        that it seemed possible from the heart valves.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        condition had to a great extent been suppressed, until finally the whole trouble had located
        in the heart. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kalmia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> removed all the dyspnea and palpitation in a few
        months, and it was nearly two years before there was a marked return of the symptoms and a
        repetition put him in a state of health, so that be needed no more medicine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This shows what a deep-acting remedy </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kalmia</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is, how long it
        may act, what wonderful changes it may effect. A remedy must be capable of going deep into
        the life to do such things.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

Rheumatic
        affections that are driven away in this manner are changed without being cured. The people
        cannot realize the danger, of merely removing symptoms. Every removal that is not in
        accordance with cure affects the centres of man, that is the heart and brain.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Rubbing is a dangerous thing. When you are importuned with the question,</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">In proportion as it mitigates the symptoms or relieves, just in that
        proportion it does the patient harm, for the whole vital economy is weakened. There are
        instances where rubbing is of benefit, but not in rheumatism.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In paralyzed muscles it is a beneficial exercise, for then rubbing can
        take the place of exercise of the patient himself, of the muscles. But rubbing is not
        admissible if it is used to reduce pain. The more agreeable it is, the worse, it is for the
        patient.</p>
