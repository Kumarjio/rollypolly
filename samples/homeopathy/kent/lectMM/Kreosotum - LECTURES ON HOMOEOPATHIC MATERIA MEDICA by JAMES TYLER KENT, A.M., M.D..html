        are three things that stand out most prominently in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosotum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, and when they

        <p align="JUSTIFY">These three characteristics are:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <blockquote>
          1. Excoriating discharges;<br>
          2. Pulsations all over the body, and<br>
          3. Profuse bleeding from small wounds.

        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When these three things arc associated in a high degree </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> should be examined. A prick of a pin will cause the oozing of bright red-
        blood, and mucous membranes bleed easily. Any pressure upon the mucous membranes will cause
        oozing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Bleeding here and there about the body. The lachrymation is excoriating.
        It excoriates the margins of the lids and checks, and they become red and raw, and smart. If
        there is a purulent discharge it is acrid. The corners of the lips and mouth are red and
        raw, and' the saliva burns and smarts. The moisture about the mouth, whatever it may be,
        excoriates and the mouth is raw. The eyes smart and burn as if raw.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The leucorrhoea causes smarting and burning about the vulva, so that the
        mucous surfaces of the labia are red and raw, sometimes inflamed, but always burning. The
        vagina burns during coition, and there is bleeding after coition; granulations of the vagina
        and os uteri, so that the pressure of the act of coition brings on bleeding and burning,
        smarting and excoriation. And the male organ will smart and burn after coming in contact
        with the secretion of the<i> </i>vagina during coition.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The urine burns and smarts. This tendency to excoriation from the
        excretions and secretions applies to all the tissues of the body.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Every emotion and exciting circumstance is attended with throbbing all
        over the body, pulsations to the ends of the fingers. Every emotion is attended with
        tearfulness, Music that will in the slightest way excite the emotion, minor strains and
        music that strikes home to the heart, pathetic music, will bring out tears that are acrid,
        and palpitation and pulsations that are felt to the extremities.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> sore throat is present the least pressure of the
        tongue depressor will establish oozing, little drops of blood will appear. During the coryza
        there is nosebleed. When the eyes are red and raw and inflamed, they will bleed easily. If
        an individual pricks the finger the blood will not merely be a single drop, but a good many
        will flow. Prolonged haemorrhage from the passages; hemorrhage from the kidneys, from the
        eyes, the nose, the uterus. Haemorrhage after coition. Tumors bleed easily.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These are the most marked features of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. If these are
        fixed in your mind, we have what may be known, as a Kreosote constitution out of which may
        come all the rest of the symptoms in all their minutiae, and little symptoms and fragments
        in every organ. You have in this one group the strong features of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. No
        matter how many particulars you may have in a case, if you do not have something of these
        general features you need not expect to find your patient constitutionally cured or relieved
        by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. These may be considered essentials.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mentally the patient is so irritable that there is nothing that will suit
        him. The wants are so numerous that nothing satisfies. The patient wants everything and is
        satisfied with nothing, that is, he wants something and when he has it he does not want it.
        That is the state of irritability and lack of satisfaction in a chronic condition.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You see the child in the mother's arms. It wants a toy, and when given it
        throws it in the face of somebody; it wants this and that and is never satisfied, always
        wanting something new, a new toy which it throws away the moment it gets it and then calls
        for something else.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The lips are red and bleeding, the corners of the month are raw, the
        eyelids red and the skin excoriated. If it has, in connection with all this, loose passages
        from the bowels and you examine the fissure between the nates, you will find it is red and
        raw. If the child be old enough to make such motions he will put the hands upon the sore
        genitals and fissures and cry out in a most irritable way, because of the smarting.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Such is the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> baby. It may be suffering from cholera infantum; it
        may be subject to wetting the bed; it may have spells of vomiting, in which it vomits all
        its food; it is a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> baby.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has attacks
        of diarrhoea and vomiting; all sorts of disturbances of the urine; great distension and
        trouble with the bowels; abdomen distended from flatus. You look over the whole case at once
        as a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> case, because of these general features that can be summed up in
        the aspect of the child.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> face has a yellowish pallor; it is a sickly
        countenance, semi-cachectic, intermingled with blotches that are reddish looking, as if
        erysipelas were going to set in. In olden times this countenance was called a scorbutic
        countenance.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Take a woman with this kind of countenance; at every menstrual flow she
        complains of much swelling and rawness of the genitals; the flow is copious, clotted, stops
        and then starts again, comes too soon and lasts too long; at times it is black, very foetid,
        produces rawness upon the thighs and the genitals, with much swelling; at every menstrual
        period there is rawness of the lips and fissures in the corners of the mouth; the tears
        become acrid; at the menstrual period all the fluids of the body seem to be acid and they
        burn wherever they touch.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Very often there is a loose stool, which is also acrid and smarts the
        anus at the menstrual period. All the symptoms are worse at the menstrual period, sometimes
        in the early part, sometimes at the middle, sometimes all through, and sometimes at the
        close. Something more about the scorbutic constitution is brought out in relation to the
        gums; the gums become puffed and red and tumid and settle away from the teeth.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They become spongy and bleed easily. In the mouth there is much
        ulceration and little ulcers spread from aphthous patches, smarting and burning; the tongue
        has ulcers upon it, which bleed easily upon touch.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">At the close of a typhoid fever haemorrhage from the bowels, bleeding
        from the mucous membranes. The mouth becomes raw, and wherever there is a mucous membrane
        there is a rawness, and the fluids that ooze continue to, eat and cause ulceration. If at
        the close of a typhoid fever, when the time comes for convalescence, vomiting comes.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Vomiting, bleedings, diarrheas. The fluids vomited from, the stomach are
        so acrid that they seem to take the skin off from the mouth, set the teeth on edge, make the
        lips raw. So excoriation from acrid fluids, as well as throbbing all over the body, are
        features that you must bear in mind with </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The discharges from the body are offensive; offensive, bloody, acrid
        discharges from the nose; offensive, watery discharges from any part of the body; sometimes
        even putrid; the leucorrhea is very offensive. Rapid emaciation, with spongy, burning
        ulceration, pus acrid, ichorous, foetid and yellow. Sometimes the inflammatory condition
        will run so high in an ulcer, only a small ulceration, that gangrene will set in, and hence
        we have a gangrenous ulceration; gangrene of parts that are inflamed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Very low formations occur upon the margins of mucous membranes; crusts
        form. Indurations under the crusts and the crusts continue to form.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The circulation is so poor, so feeble in the parts all about the margin
        of the lips and the corners of the mouth, and corners of the eyes, and eyelids, and upon the
        genitals, and there is so much venous engorgement that crusts form and ulcerate and bleed
        and pile up, and this continues until a phagedenic spot comes. This condition is so much
        like epithelioma that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has cured epithelioma.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Stomach</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The next
        striking thing in Kreosote is its stomach symptoms, Soon after eating there comes a burning
        pain in the stomach, and then a sense of fullness and an increasing nausea, ending in
        vomiting of the food, which looks as it did when taken; it looks undigested, but it is sour
        and acrid, coming up an hour or two after eating. Vomiting, the stomach seems unable to
        digest, and after the patient empties it there is constant nausea. After a swallow of water
        a prolonged bitter taste remains in the mouth.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is aggravation from eating cold things and relief from warm diet.
        In malignant diseases of the stomach when this symptom is present, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> becomes
        a great palliative; it relieves the burning and improves the digestion for a while, but the
        trouble comes again. Many times our remedies furnish us the greatest known palliation in
        cancerous affections. Homoeopathy should at all times furnish a degree of palliation in
        cancerous and other incurable malignant diseases of the stomach.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This palliation will bring more comfort to the stomach than can possibly
        be brought about by </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Mor<i>phine</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>. </i>I have watched patients under </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Morphine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">and under
        homeopathic medicine, and as a mere matter of comfort I will take the homoeopathic
        medicines.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This has been the experience of many. When you hear a homoeopath say that
        he prefers anodynes in cancerous affections of the stomach and in other painful affections,
        it is pretty sure evidence that he is not able to find the medicines that are suitable for
        the patient. These cases test the ability of the physician.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Diarrhea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a great remedy for diarrheas in the summer, especially for infants. The
        infant that I described as to his temper may be the infant suffering from the worst form of
        summer complaint, or having a light attack of cholera infantum. Or he may be "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">teething</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," and suffering from the troubles that are sometimes associated with
        teething. Infants have troubles at the time of teething only because they are sick, and if
        the child were not in disorder he would not have trouble when teething. Teething is a
        crisis, and the things that are within will come out at the time, just as there are troubles
        that are likely to come out at the time of puberty and at the climacteric period.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A marked feature of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Kreosote</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> constitution is
