        <p align="JUSTIFY">Some may think because the milk are only food for the young they are not
        medicine, but let one who is made sick from milk take it in potentized form and report the
        result. Provers who dislike milk will become sick from taking it in potencies in a few days,

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is deep and long acting; the provers felt its symptoms for years after

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mental symptoms are prolonged and distressing. It has cured enlarged
        glands. It makes ulcers very red, and it has cured such ulcers. Ulcerated areas have a dry,
        glistening appearance as if coated with epithelium.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is an important remedy in complaints following badly treated
        diphtheria, in paralysis and other conditions dating back to diphtheria. The greater number
        of its symptoms belong to the nervous system. An oversensitive state prevails, a general
        hyperesthesia of the skin and all parts. In makes women violently hysterical, and causes all
        sorts of strange and apparently impossible symptoms.</p>

        observed. Sore throats affect alternately the sides of the throat or tonsils.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Many cases of this sort have been cured by this remedy. The trouble

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Wandering features in the mental sphere, wandering and alternating
        states. Cannot collect the thoughts. She wants to leave everything as soon as it is
        commenced, a condition of irresolution common to quite a number of remedies. She is
        impressed with the idea that all she says is not so, thinks everything she says is a lie, as
        if there is no reality in the things that be.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In this it is somewhat analogous to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Alumina</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in which the

        all day about her business, and no one knows them unless she confesses them. Chronic
        sadness, everything so dark; irritable, ugly, hateful. Full of vertigo, but it is a
        sensorial symptom, unusually refined; not the vulgar swaying or tossing or feeling as if
        things were going round. It affects the whole body, as if she were swimming or floating in

        side then on the other, either side being first affected. Pains in the face or eyes,
        alternating sides, perfectly unbearable, ameliorated going into the open air. The rheumatic
