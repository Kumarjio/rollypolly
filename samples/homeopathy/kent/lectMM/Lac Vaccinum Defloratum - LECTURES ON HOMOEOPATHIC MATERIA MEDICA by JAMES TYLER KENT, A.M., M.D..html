        <p align="JUSTIFY">The untrained mind naturally rebels at the idea of giving skimmed milk to
        sick people as a remedy, but when potentized like any other substance it becomes one of the
        most useful remedies.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Every physician has seen a few cases in his practice; men, women and
        children who cannot drink milk. They say they are made sick by drinking or using milk, and
        that milk is poison to them.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is the work of the true physician to study cases and ascertain in each
        case what symptoms are observed after taking milk. These symptoms constitute a proving of it
        and it is the best kind of a proving as it is produced upon sensitive persons.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The writer has made it his duty to study each and every one of these
        cases until the image of the sickness produced by, milk has </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">dawned upon</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">him both from the individual symptoms and from a
        collective view.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Much can be learned by meditating upon the milk constitution some may
        think there is a difference of importance between milk skimmed and new milk, but for all
        practical purposes the skimmed milk is sufficient and cures the oversensitiveness to milk,
        if used in a high potency. It is useless in low potency.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a useful remedy as it may demonstrate to the unbeliever the
        wonderful power of the high potency. It has aggravation during the whole twenty-four hours;
        some cases manifest symptoms only during, the daytime, and amelioration comes with the going
        down of the sun - but this is uncommon.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The chronic milk subject is very cold and bloodless and cannot get warm
        even in a warm room and by warm clothing; she is so chilly and so sensitive to cold that she
        feels the air blowing on her in the room, as if she were fanned, even where there is no
        possible draft and others feel the room to be very warm.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She is very sensitive to wet weather. She is subject to neuralgic and
        rheumatic pains all over the body but more especially in the head. The pain in the head is
        better from cold, applications, but the pains elsewhere are better from heat. The sufferings
        are all worse by motion and better by rest; pains are better by pressure.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bones are sore to touch. Great lassitude and even weakness, can
        endure no exertion. There is marked restlessness and she is unable to hold up after loss of
        sleep; extreme weariness from a short walk.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She looks and acts as though she had been suffering long or as if she
        were going into a decline. The skin all over the body is violently sensitive to cold objects
        and touch of cold sponge. There is marked periodicity in the nature of the remedy, most
        noticed in the recurrent headaches. This remedy has had a reputation for curing diabetes and
        this is not to be wondered at when it is known to have cured the weakness, anaemia and
        copious, watery urine and great thirst; also copious, dense urine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many invalids cured by this remedy have appeared to the writer much like
        the typical diabetic patient; but it can cure only where the peculiar symptoms agree. It
        will not cure simply when the common symptoms are present.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Let all observers faithfully and minutely study all patients who have an
        aversion to milk; all who have diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, sick headaches, eructations,
        foul stomach after drinking milk and in time the general idea of the milk sickness will be
        known.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a most useful and frequently needed remedy for infants and children
        who cannot take milk, not always as their specific remedy, but as one of the remedies that
        will help many infants to grow up some grow morbidly fat and others become lean when fed on
        milk.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has been useful in dropsy from weak heart; from liver complaints and
        from suppressed malaria. People who drink milk habitually become anemic and catarrhal; fatty
        degeneration of muscles, of heart and liver. Malassimilation, is the most marked feature of
        milk poison.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">The pains</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> become
        violent in many parts; in the spinal cord; in eyeballs; in supra-orbital nerves; in forehead
        and through the head; in the stomach; in lower part of the abdomen. Many people are made
        sick by milk who use cream with safety and delight.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        often the remedy for such patients and after a careful examination, their symptoms appear
        like the proving of skimmed milk.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
