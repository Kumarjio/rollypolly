        right side. It has a strong affinity for the ovaries, and in this it will be found that the
        left ovary is affected first. So, in inflammation of the ovaries, the left will be affected
        first, and later the right.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        occipital headache, will be more affected than the right. This does not always follow, and

        felt until after the patient wakes up from a long sleep, but if the aggravation is one that
        is of considerable violence, the patient may feel it immediately on going to sleep, and it
        arouses him; for instance, the heart symptoms. As soon as he goes into a sleep he rouses up
        with palpitation, with dyspnoea, with suffocation, with exhaustion, with vertigo, with pain
        in the back of the head, and many other circulatory disturbances.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Suspects that they are contriving to injure her, and she will resort to
        any scheme to see if they were not talking of her to her detriment. A woman imagines that
        her friends, husband, and children are trying to damage her; that her friends are going to
        put her in an insane asylum.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Apprehension of the future. Thinks she is going to have heart disease,
        and is going insane; and that people are contriving to put her in an insane asylum. Imagine
        her relatives are trying to poison her and she refuses to eat. She thinks sometimes that it
        is only a dream and she can hardly say whether she dreamed it or whether she thinks it. She
        thinks she is dead, or dreams that she is dead, and in the dream preparations are being made
        to lay her out, or that she is about to die.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Thinks she is somebody else, and in the hands of a stronger power. She
        thinks she is </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">under superhuman
        control. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">She is compelled to do
        things by spirits. She hears a command, partly in her dream, that she must carry out.
        Sometimes it takes the form of voices in which she is commanded to steal, to murder, or to
        confess things she never did, and she has no peace of mind until she makes a confession of
        something she has never done.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The torture is something violent until she confesses that which she has
        not done. Imagines she is pursued. Imagines that she has stolen something, or that somebody
        thinks she has stolen something, and fears the law. She hears voices and warnings, and in
        the night she dreams about it. The state of torture is something dreadful, and it then goes
        into a delirium with muttering. The delirium is carried on like one muttering when drunk.
        This state increases until unconsciousness comes on and the patient enters into a coma from
        which he cannot be aroused. The patient also goes through periods of violence and violent
        delirium.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is full of </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">religious

        what would be called an upright and pious life, yet she is not able to apply the promises
        that are in the Word of God to herself; these things seem to apply to somebody else but not
        to her. She is full of wickedness and has committed the unpardonable sin. She is compelled
        to say these things; she is overwhelmed by these things and she is going to die and going to
        that awful hell that she reads about. The physician must listen to this with attention. The
        physician might make the mistake in this instance of making light of such feelings. If he
        does, the patient will not return, and he will be deprived of the chance of benefiting her.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">No matter what her whims are, no matter what her religious opinions are,
        her state of mind must be treated with respect. It must be treated as if it were so.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">She must have sympathy and kindness. It is an unfortunate thing for a
        doctor to get a reputation of being an ungodly man, among pious people, as he will be
        deprived of doing these people an immense amount of good. He must be candid with all the
        whims and notions of the people that he visits in the world. He must be everybody’s friend
        and he can be such without any hypocrisy if he is simply an upright and just man.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The state of religious melancholy, with religious insanity, is not

It is commonly among women, very seldom
        among men, that we find this religious melancholy. Now, this woman is impelled to tell it;
        she will annoy her intimate friends, day and night, with this story of the damnation of her
        soul and her wickedness and all, the awful things she has done. If you ask her what things
        she has committed she will say everything, but you cannot pin her down to the fact that she
        has killed anybody. If you allow her to go through with her story she will tell you all the
        crimes in the calendar that she has committed, although she has been a well-behaved and
        well-disposed woman.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is another kind of loquacity belonging to </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. The
        patient is impelled to talk continuously. It is found in another. state in which the patient
        is compelled to hurry in everything she does and wants everybody else to hurry, With that
        state of hurry is brought out the loquacity, and this is something far beyond comprehension,
        until you have once heard it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is no use attempting to describe it, it is so rapid, changing from
        one subject to another. Sentences are sometimes only half finished; she takes it for granted
        that you understand the balance and she will hurry an. Day and night she is wide awake, and
        with such sensitiveness to her surroundings that you, would naturally think, from what
        things she hears and how she is disturbed, by noise, that she can hear the flies walk upon
        the walls and the clock striking upon the distant steeple.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You do not get all these things in the text, you have to see them
        applied. But the things I give you that are brought out clinically are those things that
        have come from applying the symptoms of the remedy at the bedside to sick folks.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Most extraordinary loquacity, making speeches in very select
        phrases but jumping off to most heterogeneous subjects."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"One word often leads into the midst of another story."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These states may come on in acute diseases like typhoid, when it will
        take the usual typhoid delirium, or they may come on in conditions like diphtheria, or in
        any of the diseases that are characterized by blood poisoning; they may come on in the
        puerperal state, or may take the form of insanity. It is a long acting remedy, and if it has
        been abused its effects will last a life time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In many cases a close connection between the mental symptoms and the
        heart symptoms will be noticed, especially in young women and girls who have met with
        disappointment, who have been lying awake nights because of disturbance of the affections,
        or from disappointment, or from shattered hopes, or from grief.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Prolonged melancholy, mental depression, hysterical symptoms, weeping,
        mental prostration and despair, with pain in the heart, with a gone sensation or sensation
        of weakness in the heart, with difficult breathing. She meditates upon suicide, and finally
        settles back into an apathetic state, in which there is an aversion to, everything, to work,
        and even to thinking.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I might impress upon your mind the head symptoms if I related the case of
        a patient who described her symptoms probably more typically than you can find in the books.
        She was sitting up in bed and unable to lie down; she was worse from lying down, her face
        was purple, her eyes were engorged, the face puffed and tumid and the eyelids bloated. She
        sat there perfectly quiet in bed and described the pain as a surging sensation, which came
        up the back of the neck and head and then over the head.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">That is a typical feature of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. A surging in
        waves. Waves of Pain that are not always synchronous with the pulse. They may not relate to
