        of it but for the fact that it relates to a class of cases so very important that you will
        not be able to get along without it. It is related to the older and deeper psoric sickness.

        that tendency to go into marasmus. The child's muscles are flabby, the child will not thrive
        in spite of feeding and medicines. It seems to be laying the foundations for some serious
        trouble.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Finally, it emaciates and the back of the head begins to sink in, as if
        from atrophy of the cerebellum. The appetite increases for milk and meat and animal broths,

        the head. The occipital bone will sink in, and the parietal bones jut out over it, and there
        will be a depression. That is not an uncommon thing in children that go into marasmus. They
        are very likely to have a potter's clay stool. It does not run, and it is not hard.</p>

        orphanage, where we had sixty to one hundred babies on hand all tho time. The puzzle of my

        flabby, muscles relaxed, and with tendency to prolapsus. The walls of the abdomen have a
        tendency to fall down and to be relaxed, and the rings favor the formation of hernia.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">That is the kind of relaxation. The nerves are painful, and the muscles
        are tired. When you have such a case and have prescribed, and they persist in spite of every
        remedy, you know that the case does not well indicate a remedy, that the conditions are
        latent and there is a tendency to some grave internal disorder. The organs are threatening
        to break down; the kidneys, the heart, the lungs, or the brain are about to undergo organic
        change.</p>

        open the eyes. The skin becomes dry and itches and burns. Tendency to dryness of the mucous
