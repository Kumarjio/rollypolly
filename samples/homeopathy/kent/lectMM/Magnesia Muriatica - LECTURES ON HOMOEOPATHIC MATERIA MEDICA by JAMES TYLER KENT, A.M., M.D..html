        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It would seem rather strange that the two remedies to which </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hahnemann</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> gave such a good start by proving and use should be so neglected and
        forgotten as </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Magnesia carb. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and Magnesia mur.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> have been.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">These two, if used, would cure many of the liver troubles that are not
        now cured. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Magnesia mur.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> could cure many conditions in nervous, excitable
        women that now go uncured. These remedies are neglected, while </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phosphorus </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and
        <i>Sulphur</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i> </i>are prescribed for
        almost everything.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Magnesia mur</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. is a
        deep-acting antipsoric suited to nervous patients with stomach and liver troubles. it has
        enlarged glands and irritation of the nerve centres and brain. This patient is often
        sensitive to cold, chilly, but be desires fresh air and open air.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many of the complaints are ameliorated by the open, fresh air, but come
        head symptoms are an exception. The head must be covered, as it is so sensitive to the open
        air. He is extremely restless; only with great difficulty can he keep still, and if forced
        to keep still, he becomes anxious. Anxiety is the marked feature. Restlessness, fidgetiness
        throughout the body, coupled with anxiety.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This comes on at any time, but it is worse at night in bed and still
        worse on closing the eyes to go to sleep. When he closes the eyes he becomes go anxious,
        restless and fidgety that he must throw the covers off, take a long breath or do something.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He is kept awake at night by the anxious feeling. It was described
        originally by the prover as an uneasiness, but in the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Guiding Symptoms</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> it is
        spoken of as a restlessness in bed. If you study the hysterical nature, the anxiety and
        restlessness, you will see it is throughout the whole economy and should be classed under
        mind and nerves.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Some remedies have vertigo on closing the eyes, some have anxiety on
        closing the eyes. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has sweat on closing the eyes. These were the points
        used by keynote prescribers and some times good results were obtained. I remember once
        curing an organic stricture, which had been dilated but was no better.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The patient described his symptoms and the stricture was all he could
        think of. I did not see his remedy and gave everything without relief. One day, however, he
        told me he could not close his eyes to go to sleep without having a profuse sweat. I gave
        him </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> on that keynote alone but it cured him of the sweat and the
        stricture, brought back an old gonorrheal discharge and resorption of the inflammatory
        material took place.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A scientific prescriber would not do that; but when he heard that symptom
        he would not know it was in the nature of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> to have the stricture, and in another case he would
        see that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Conium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> did not suit, and he would know when and when not to give it.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Anxious in the room, ameliorated in the open air. Anxiety at night in bed
        on closing the eyes. While reading she felt as if some one were reading after her and she
        must read faster and faster. That occurs in patients who are tired from being worked up to
        the highest pitch and it seems as if they would fly to pieces. Any thought that comes into
        the mind tends to repeat itself.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Vertigo, ameliorated walking in the open air. Vertigo in the morning on
        rising. The head symptoms are troublesome. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Silicea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will be given in

        ameliorated from wrapping up the head. This remedy has it also. Soreness of the hair
        follicles. Sensation as if the hair were pulled. Headache ameliorated from tying a bandage
        tight around the head or wrapping up the head.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Yellowness all over the body. Yellow eye in jaundice and liver troubles.
        Eyes inflamed. Margins of lids and eyelashes crusty; fine pimples and eruptions. After
        leaving the head symptoms, which are relieved by warmth, we find many symptoms worse in the
        warm room.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pulsation in the ears. Ulceration of the edges of the nostrils. Tongue
        has the appearance as if it had been burnt, excoriated and cracked in various directions.
        Fissures hum like fire. Hunger but knows not for what. Ravenous hunger followed by nausea.
        Aggravation from salt things, from eating salt food, from salt baths, from sea bathing, and

        easily disordered. Waterbrash, vomiting. Like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Magnesia carb.,</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">it has inability to digest milk. Milk causes pain, and
        it is passed undigested lienteric stools. Fainting at the dinner table in hysterical women.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It has many liver troubles. Enlargement and induration of the liver, with
        jaundiced skin. Right lobe of liver sore, painful while lying on it and when he turns over
        to the left he is uncomfortable, as it feels as if the liver dragged over to the left.</p>

        together. It has much liver trouble from lying on the liver.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tenderness in the region of the stomach and over the bowels. Attacks of
        gastralgia in the evening, A strong feature in this remedy is indigestion. The stomach
        becomes less and less able to digest and finally he cannot take a mouthful of food without
        distress.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Abdominal dropsies. Colic, cramps, tearing pains. Great flatulence. With
        this kind of digestive disturbance we have a good home for tapeworm, it hatches out easily
        in this patient. The most troublesome patients I have are those who come after having had a
        tapeworm removed by violent drugs. It takes a long time to restore them. If a patient will
        come with his worm and all his symptoms, I will give him relief, and he will soon be turned
        into order and the tapeworm will cause no trouble.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">No Power to expel the contents of the bladder, so he presses with the
        abdominal muscles on the full bladder and passes a little. Lack of sensation in the bladder,
        so that sometimes he cannot tell whether, he has to urinate or not until his bladder is so
        full that it causes pressure. The inability to feel extends to the urethra, and he cannot
        tell in the dark whether he is passing urine or not. Metrorrhagia, with backache which is
        ameliorated by pressing hard back in the chair or lying on a hard pillow. Bearing down pains
        in the pelvis, especially in hysterical women and girls.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Congestion of chest from sea bathing. Chest troubles and colds on the

        baths. It is the aggravation from salt. Sleep unrefreshing, anxious dreams. Bodily state
