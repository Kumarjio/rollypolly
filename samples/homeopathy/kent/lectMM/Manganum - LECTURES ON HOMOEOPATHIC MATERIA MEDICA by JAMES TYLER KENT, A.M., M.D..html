        menses have been delayed until the patient was eighteen or twenty years of age.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A strong feature is the great soreness of the periosteum, and especially
        of the shin bone. Tendency to ulceration and eruptions, and around these there is thickening
        and infiltration. Chronic eruptions; inveterate like psoriasis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Small ulcers suppurate and infiltrate with purple hardness. It has a deep
        action, breaks down the blood corpuscles and lays the foundation for tuberculosis,
        especially in the larynx. Repeated attacks of laryngitis, each leaving the patient in a
        worse state than before. Tuberculosis that begins in the larynx. Aversion to food, no
        appetite, nothing will tempt him.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This, with great soreness over the body, lays the foundation for some
        deep complaint. It is not an acute periostitis, but a passive soreness all over.
        Inflammation of the joints and swellings go on to suppuration and necrosis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Ulcerations and suppurative processes take on a quality of
        semi-malignancy and do not heal, presenting an erysipelatous appearance. Everywhere there is

        take up some, of the mental symptoms.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are only a few of them, but they are striking, and these go deeper
        into the nature of the man himself, even than those we have been speaking about.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Anxiety and fear. Great apprehensiveness. Something awful is going to
        happen. Restless and anxious. He walks the floor, and the more he walks the floor the more
        anxious he becomes. He attempts mental occupation; tries to occupy his mind, and the more he
        does this, the more anxious he becomes.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He is tired and careworn. He cannot think; he cannot meditate. He has
        difficulties in his business because he cannot do good thinking. Anxious restlessness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The queerest part of all is just how he gets relief. He lies down and it
        all passes away. You cannot- find that in every medicine; that is rare, strange and
        peculiar. And yet, see how general it is; it defines the whole nature of the sick man. His
        very life is excited, tired and anxious. Great sadness and distress.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He lies down and says,</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Why did I not think of that before?"</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Perfectly comfortable now. He gets up, and the anxiety and restlessness
        come over him again, and he is fairly driven to distraction.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">See how unlike </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">that gets relief from motion.

        the patient goes from one bed to another, from bed to chair and back again; he cannot sit
        still, or lie still, for his anxiety is worse keeping still.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">See how striking these symptoms are, and see what a contrast we have. The
        very innermost life, of the patient is talking to us and asking for remedies. We must now
        read the signs and inner expressions of the disordered economy.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Then, he has these tormenting fears. Anxiety in the day time while moving
        about, better while lying. down. Sad, weeping and silent. Can think of nothing to console
        him but to lie down and get peace. Is it any wonder, then, that some of these patients are
        driven to a bedridden state? And </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Manganum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a wonderful remedy for bedridden women who love to
        keep still, and it is said of them that they love to lie in bed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">As far as we have gone we see that everything brings out that very idea
        and the nature of things that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hahnemann</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> talks about in his first paragraph, that the sole
        duty of the physician is to pay his attention to the sick, to the patient himself; and who
        is this patient himself?</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
