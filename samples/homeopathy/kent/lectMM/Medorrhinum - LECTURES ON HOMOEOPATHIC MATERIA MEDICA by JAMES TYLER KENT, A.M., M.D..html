        <p align="JUSTIFY">The physician of long and active experience meets many obstinate cases in
        children. The infant soon emaciates and becomes marasmic, or a child becomes asthmatic, or
        suffers with vicious catarrh of nose or eyelids, or has ringworm on the scalp or face, or is
        dwarfed; and after some waste of time it comes to mind that the father was treated for
        gonorrhea that was obstinate and perhaps had condylomata on the genitalia.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy will cure, or begin the recovery. The woman married several
        years desires to become a mother. She was healthy when she married, but now she has ovarian
        pains, menstrual troubles, she has lost all sexual response, is growing pale and waxy, and
        becoming violently sensitive and nervous.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The husband's history gives the cause, and this remedy will cure. The
        pale waxy young men, who crave stimulants and tobacco, who are sensitive to drafts, become
        stiff after exertion and walking, who perspire easily and are extremely sensitive to cold,
        who have never been well since having a gonorrhea cured by injections.</p>
