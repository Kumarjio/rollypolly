        <p align="JUSTIFY">The principal use of this remedy is in eruptions and ulcerations.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The most violent and important of its symptoms are those of mucous
        membranes, skin and periosteum. The outer surfaces of the body are in a constant state of
        irritation; nervous feelings, biting, tingling, itching, changing place from scratching.
        Even when there is nothing to be seen, there is violent itching and the patient rubs and
        scratches until the part becomes raw and then burns; itching changes place; the part becomes
        cold after scratching, cold in spots. Itching changing place after scratching, especially
        when associated with no visible cause.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">As soon as he gets warm in bed or as soon as he goes into a warm room,
        the itching begins. Formication, itching, biting. The patient is so nervous that he is
        compelled to move, to change positions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Vesicular eruptions upon the skin, running a certain course, itching,
        burning like fire; dries into a crust and disappears; a new crop appears near or in the same
        place. Vesicles form crusts beneath which is ulceration; these crusts turn white,
        chalk-like, are thick, tough and leathery.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">They are often elevated; fluctuation beneath the crusts; pressure causes
        thick, white pus, sometimes yellow-white, to ooze forth; violent itching. The pains are
        aggravated by cold, but the itching and restlessness are worse from beat. A child tears. at
        the eruption with its fingers when the crusts are present.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Scald-head; thick, white, elevated crusts; copious, white or yellow white
        pus, often offensive, putrid; vermin are often found among the crusts. Acrid pus eating away
        the hair; the eruption spreads to any part of the scalp, especially to the top; it is also
        found beneath the ears, and about the face and chin.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Eruptions with much itching; dark, red rash with violent itching, biting,
        tingling, crawling, changing place by pressure, rubbing or scratching. Cases with a history
        of suppressed eczema or syphilis. Eruptions upon the legs and arms, on parts with poor
        circulation as the ears, wrists, backs of the bands; skin eruptions followed by ulcers;
        discharging a thick, white, offensive matter.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Especially useful where eruptions have been suppressed by zinc ointment,
        mercurial salve, etc. Eruptions on the face, eyes, ears and scalp in child or adult, which
        have disappeared under the use of some ointment and inveterate catarrhal conditions have
        resulted, or in which eye symptoms have developed; conjunctiva chronically swollen,
        ectropion, granular lids, conjunctival surfaces like raw beef; fissures in the comers of the
        eye; red cicatrices about the eyes where the eruptions have been; dry spots and enlarged
        veins about the eyes and nose; skin feels indurated.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Ear troubles from suppressed eruptions; thickening of the mucous
        membranes of the ears; degeneration of the drum of the car; deafness, otorrhoea.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Offensive and troublesome catarrh of the nose; incrustations, thickening
        of the mucous membrane, ulceration; he hawks thick, yellow matter out of the throat; has
        been cauterized, atomized, etc., and yet the offensive ozoena remains. The periosteum is
        affected so that it breaks down. Advanced state of atrophic degeneration of the mucous
        membranes of the throat and nose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the throat, thickening, burning, chronic redness, tumefaction,
        smarting, soreness on swallowing; granulations and ulcerations of the throat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Perforating ulcers of the soft palate, all due to suppressed eruptions.
        Give the remedy and you will have a copious eruption in the original place; if not, there
        will be no relief. Often the deafness cannot be cured, because the drum of the ear or the
        whole ear is destroyed, is white, chalky, and contains no blood-vessels; a state of atrophic
        catarrh, so that there is too much structural change for hearing to be restored, yet the
        patient can be cured.</p>

        colored eruptions found in syphilis.</p>

        neuralgias. After the eruptions have given place to internal manifestations, the patient is
        chilly, sensitive to the changes of the weather, worse in stormy weather; worse after a
        bath, because he takes cold and his internal complaints are aggravated. The eruptions are
