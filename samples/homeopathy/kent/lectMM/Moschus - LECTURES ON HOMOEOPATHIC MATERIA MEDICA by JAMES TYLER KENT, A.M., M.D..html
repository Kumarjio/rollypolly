        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">They are self-willed, obstinate and selfish. When they have been
        encouraged to resort to crafty cunning, to have every whim gratified from infancy to
        eighteen years of age they become fit subjects for </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Mosch., <i>Asa f., Ignatia </i>and Valer.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">They not only have volumes of real and imaginary symptoms, but they
        become adepts at producing at will a kaleidoscopic complex of symptoms, increasing in
        quantity and intensity until all their own desires are attained, and the onlooker, be he or
        she nurse, physician or bewildered mother, is overwhelmed, dismayed and in retreat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">However much they pretend to be honest and truthful their reported
        sensations are untrustworthy. They have traded upon their sensations and imagination so long
        that a direct effort to give a truthful statement is unsuccessful. The most erratic and
        unexpected neuropathic phenomena are always in appearance.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The physician cannot measure these cases by his experience and say what
        is common and uncommon. He is compelled to fall back upon the one word that covers a
        multitude of these manifestations, viz., "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hysteria</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">."</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        indicated in these constitutions and cures much that is morbid, when its own peculiar
        symptoms agree. When one of these girls becomes sick from taking cold the acute symptoms
        will be told with a host of her imaginary sensations.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The globus hystericus is generally present, hyperesthesia of the skin,
        quivering of the muscles, wakefulness, palpitation, excitement, fainting and trembling.</p>

        cramps in hands and feet, convulsions of whole body. It is not generally known that the
        morbid sensations and functions correspond with the mental state of the individual. When the
        functions and tissue symptoms are hysterical or erratic the mental state will be found to be
        correspondingly hysterical.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        and cold, the other pale and hot, there is certainly some hysterical perversion in the mind
        of that patient. Many times it is possible to suspect morbid mental states by knowing morbid
        sensations and functions. There is a kind of order in all morbid expressions seen in sick
        people.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
