        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The use of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Naja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has extended far beyond its proving.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">So many of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ophidian</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> family present symptoms in common with it, that much
        has been presumed truly so.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many characteristics run through these remedies, each remedy having its
        own peculiar sphere. Taken together the family presents a wide range of curative action.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Mure</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, of Brazil,
        thought that the snake family presented curative powers for the healing of the nations.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the mineral kingdom, man may find his remedy when sick, so in the
        vegetable and animal kingdom. It is possible that the product of the serpent may be
        everything needed for the healing of man. Extend this to the whole animal kingdom and it is
        probably so.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There seems to be everything existing in one kingdom that exists in
        another. The lowest is the mineral, the next the vegetable, and last the animal kingdom. If
        we had a perfect knowledge of any one kingdom, we could probably cover the entire scope of
        curative possibilities. But we have only a knowledge of a few remedies in each kingdom.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Another idea has been advanced that in any particular region, the
        vegetable kingdom provides all that is necessary for curing in that region. If we were
        acquainted with all the vegetable growths, how much we would know in comparison with what we
        do know!</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is highly probable that there is a throwing off from the sick human
        race of something that is absorbed by the plants, The evils that are thrown off by man may
        be absorbed by the vegetable kingdom. Plants will correspond to men in the region in which
        they grow, if there is anything in this.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In two thousand years there might be a necessity for some kind of a check
        upon the growth of plants. The absorption of these evils may cause them to vary in species,
        and if they continue to grow and each to absorb the evils from the human race, they will
        continue to differ. This favors evolution and explains it in a sense.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is important to compare the symptoms of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Naja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> with those
        of the other snakes. The patient is disturbed by closeness of the collar, &lt; after sleep.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are exhaustion and trembling, trembling, of the muscles. Its

        all complaints to settle about the heart. It is used in valvular troubles of the heart, in
        young persons who grow up with cardiac valvular diseases. The whole trouble settled about
        the heart. This suggests </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Naja, and Naja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has often cured.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        there is inability to lie on the left side. Numbness of the left arm. There is dyspnoea; if
        he goes to sleep, he wakes up suffocating, gasping, choking or he starts. from sleep as if

        &lt; in a warm room; the head feels warm, fevered, yet the feet and limb do not become warm.
        There is copious sweating of the hands and feet causing the gloves and shoes to rot out; but
        the sweat is not offensive.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a sense of fullness and puffiness of the hands and feet, showing
        a slow circulation in the veins which we might expect.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We might naturally expect that this patient would be intense and
        excitable, which is the case. There is a suicidal tendency.</p>
