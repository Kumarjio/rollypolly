        surroundings, and the become irritable, so that they want to tear things, to scold. Impulses
        are strongly marked at times. The woman has impulses to destroy her husband or to throw her
        child into the fire; the impulse is intermingled with violent temper, cannot be contradicted
        or opposed; if a chair is in the way he kicks it over; if, while undressing, a part of his
        clothing should catch on a button he would pull it off because he is so mad at it. (Like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Nit. ac</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.).</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">An uncontrollable state of irritability; it is a weakness and is
        accompanied by physical weakness; a lack of balance. For example, a business man has been at
        his desk until he is tired out, he receives many letters, he has a great many irons in the
        fire; he is troubled with a thousand little things; his mind is constantly hurried from one
        thing to another until be is tortured. It is not so much the heavy affairs but the little
        things. He is compelled to stimulate his memory to attend to all the details; he goes home
        and thinks about it; be lies awake, at night; his mind is confused with the whirl of
        business and the affairs of the day crowd upon him; finally brain fag comes on.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When the details come to him be gets angry and wants to get away, tears
        things up, scolds, goes home and takes it out of his family and children. Sleeps by fits and
        starts; wakens at 3 <i>A.M</i>., and his business affairs crowd on him so that he cannot
        sleep again until late in the morning when he falls into a fatiguing sleep and wakens up
        tired and exhausted. He wants to sleep late in the morning.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Melancholy, sadness, but all the time he feels as if he could fly to
        pieces, jerks things about, tears things up; wants to force things his own way. Driven by
        impulses to commit acts that verge upon insanity - the destruction of others. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Natr. sul.</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">has a strong impulse

        easily on the slightest provocation. Brain fag, fatigue, neuralgias; on the verge of
        insanity and this goes on to convulsions. Convulsions of single muscles and those of the
        whole body; muscular twitchings; weakness, trembling, and paralysis. This paralytic weakness
        and disordered state of the activity of the muscles and nerves are prominent.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Another state running through Nux is that actions are turned in opposite
        directions. When the stomach is sick, it will empty its contents with no great effort
        ordinarily, but in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Nux</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> there is retching and straining as if the action were
        going the wrong way, as if it would force the abdomen open; a reversed action; retches,
        gags, and strains and after a prolonged effort he finally empties the stomach.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The same condition is found in the bladder. He must strain to urinate.
        There is tenesmus, urging. The bladder is full and the urine dribbles away, yet when he
        strains it ceases to dribble. In regard to the bowels, though the patient strains much, he
        passes but a scanty stool.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the diarrhea at times when he sits on the commode in a perfectly
        passive way, there will be a little squirt of stool, and then comes on tenesmus so that he
        cannot stop straining, and when he does strain there comes on the sensation of forcing back;
        the stool seems to go back; a kind of anti-peristalsis.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In constipation the more he strains the harder it is to pass a stool. In
        diarrhea and dysentery there is straining without relief, but as soon as he passes a little

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Renal colic is caused by a stone in the ureter, which by its irritation

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The same is true of gall stone colic. The remedy that ameliorates, or
