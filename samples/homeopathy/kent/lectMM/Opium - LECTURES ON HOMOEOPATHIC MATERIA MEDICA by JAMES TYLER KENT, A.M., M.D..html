        <p align="CENTER">Opium</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Generals</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Among the
        striking features of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is a class of complaints marked by painlessness,
        inactivity, and torpor.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many of the provers taking small doses had torpor, inability to realize
        or feel their surroundings, or to take in the nature of states and judge of things.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Deception in vision, taste, touch; deception of the state he exists in;
        in his own realization; a perversion of all the senses with much deception.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The general characteristic is painlessness, but now and then an alternate
        state is produced, in which a small dose of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will cause pain,
        sleeplessness, inquietude, nervous excitability; the very opposite state from that produced
        in the majority of cases.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The majority are constipated, but in some there is dysentery and
        tenesmus. The patient is sleepy, yet at times the drug is characterized by sleepless nights,
        anxiety, increased sensitiveness to noise, so that he says ho can almost hear the flies
        walking on the wall, and hears the clock striking in the distant steeple.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is generally supposed that in these opposite conditions one is primary
        and the other is secondary. This is true, e. g., those exhibiting stupor and painlessness
        will go into a state of increased insensibility, inquietude, anxiety, and irritability, and
        also one who has a state of increased sensibility first will have a docile state following.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Head and mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Some
        oversensitive provers will get a basilar headache in the first hour after taking a dose, so
        that they cannot raise the head from the pillow; they are paralyzed from it; the pain holds
        them down. This does not come on in most provers until the waning of a large dose. This has
        been debated over as the primary and secondary actions. What is the action in one is the
        reaction in another, but all are the effects of the drug, and all the actions that follow
        are the symptoms of the remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The sluggishness and painlessness are most striking. The inaction is
        shown in the lack of reaction to the properly selected homeopathic remedy. It here competes
        with </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sulphur</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">On<i> </i>studying
        the case you may find many </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> symptoms, and when given thus indicated, it rouses
        the system out of the state of sluggishness and causes reaction.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Ulcers which are perfectly painless, which do not granulate, and do not
        eat or spread, with numbness or lack of sensibility in the ulcer that ought to be sensitive;
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will often heal insensibility in parts that are in a high grade of
        inflammation.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Paralytic conditions or paresis, partial paralysis; inactivity,
        sluggishness. Such a condition is found in the bowels so that they do not move, and rectum
        fills with round, hard, black balls, which can be dug out with the finger or spoon. There is
        no activity, no ability to strain at stool.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bladder is in a similar state. There is no ability to use the
        abdominal muscles; he cannot strain to urinate retention of accelerator muscles are in a
        state of paresis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When drinking the oesophagus seems to have no action and the fluid does
        not go down but passes out through the nose; a paresis fluids go down the wrong way or out
        through the nose.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Weakness of limbs and muscles; weakness and paralysis.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Often there is a state of peace. Wants to be let alone. She tells you she
        is not sick; and yet she has a temperature of 105-106°, is covered with a scorching hot
        sweat, has a rapid pulse; is delirious. You ask her how she is and she says she is perfectly
        well and happy; no pains or aches; wants nothing and has no symptoms. But the nurse tells
        you that the patient has passed no stool or urine.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Face</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The face looks
        besotted, bloated, purple; the eyes are glassy and the pupils contracted. The brain is in a
        state of confusion, yet she can answer questions. Or the mental symptoms may be more marked
        and the physical condition less prominent; there is confusion of mind, delirium, loquacity,
        but this is rare, more commonly only talks when aroused; a condition of stupor in which the
        patient will say nothing and do nothing. Delirium with a happy turn of mind.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The stomach is in a state of undue warmth, sinking, all-gone, hungry, and
        this is not relieved by eating. He fills the stomach full and yet the faint feeling remains.
        The food sours in the stomach and is vomited. He can take no more food. He becomes covered
        with a cold sweat; great exhaustion; nausea, retching and the vomiting continues. This
        nausea is a troublesome symptom following the administration of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> or </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Morphine</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It is a prolonged
        vomiting and nausea. He can take nothing into the stomach and nothing will stop the vomiting
        for him.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The homoeopath knows the use of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Chamomilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and one dose
        will give wonderful relief at once and stop the deathly sinking and nausea.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">There is never any use for the crude </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in the sick room.
        In surgery at times it is admitted that something seems necessary, and we will not quarrel
        with the surgeon. But in disease, in sick people, it is not necessary. It performs no use
        and in the end it is an injury; it prevents finding the homoeopathic remedy. It has masked
        the symptoms and spoiled the case, and you cannot do anything for days.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has been much
        abused and much has been learned about it, but this abuse has not helped much in its
        proving, for the individualizing symptoms are not obtained. Big doses cause gross effects,
        and the symptoms thus obtained are sometimes useful, <i>e. g., </i>in cerebral apoplexy with
        stertorous breathing, jaw dropped, pupils dilated or contracted, generally the latter, face
        mottled, purple, or hot, hot sweat, one sided paralysis.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">You would wonder on seeing such a case whether be had been paralyzed, had
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, injured himself in a fall or bad been indulging in the bottle, and you
        would.. examine the case to distinguish. This is a mechanical trouble, there is pressure of
        blood on the brain. This alone may not kill but later on inflammatory action is set up
        around the clot.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> causes a flow of
        blood to the brain, and when given homeopathically it checks this, and in six hours he will
        become rational, his skin cool, face normal color, pulse normal. We thus see the usefulness
        of the crude effects of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in giving us a picture of apoplexy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Nervous headaches beginning in the back of the head and spreading over
        the whole face; worse in the morning. He feels as if his head were held down to the pillow
        by the intense aching pain in the base of the brain and yet when he gets up he is unable to
        lie down again.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Women</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This is common
        in women; a false plethora; excitable; going through pregnancy or menstruation; headache.
        The patient sits up and is unable to lie down. The pain begins in the morning and is so
        violent that the patient cannot move, cannot wink the eye, turn the head, cannot bear the
        least jar or the ticking of the clock; face is mottled, purple, blue; eyes injected. It is
        difficult to get symptoms from her. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will relieve at once.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But most of the complaints are painless.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It takes on the appearance of drinkers, besotted; fever with besotted
        countenance. Delirium tremens with awful anxiety, vomiting, congestive headache, contracted
        pupils; violent headache after drinking, exhaustion; not able to get out of bed; delirium.
        Most of the complaints are attended with stupor; lies in a stupor like apoplexy, cannot be
        aroused.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Convulsions</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient is full of convulsions. The patient wants to be uncovered, wants
        the cool air, the open air. Convulsions if the room, is too warm. Opisthotonos; head drawn
        back, cerebro-spinal meningitis.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In a case of cerebro-spinal meningitis we find convulsions approaching,
        opisthotonos, head drawn back, kicks the covers off, wants a cool room; skin red; face red
        and mottled, pupils contracted. Now if the mother puts that child into a hot bath, to
        relieve the convulsions, it will become unconscious and cold as death. If you are called to
        see such a case be sure to give </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, and in twelve hours you will be astonished to see
        the state of quietude. It competes here with </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Puerperal

        appearance of awful fear or anxiety. The old </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Opium</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> eater is
        overwhelmed with anxiety and fear. If a dog jump at him suddenly, he will be thrown into
