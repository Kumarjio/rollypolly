        <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the early things that Petroleum does to a prover is that it puts
        him in a state of confusion of mind and dizziness; he is dazed so that he loses his way in
        the street. She has strange imaginations that there are people near her who are not present;
        that the atmosphere is full of strange forms; that her limbs are double; that another person
        is in the bed with her.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Such things are found in the fevers. A woman after childbirth imagines
        there is another child in bed with her, and she wonders how she will take care of the two.
        These ideas are found in many diseases, have been often verified. In typhoids and low forms
        of sickness; in diarrheas; when just awakening he is in confusion; in his dreams he had the
        idea of being two or more and the impression remains with him while he is in a
        semi-conscious state. He cannot reconcile the state, but when aroused to consciousness he is
        able to reason it away, and when semi-conscious again it returns. This annoys him day and
        night.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Skin</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> symptoms. The
        surface symptoms are striking. The tendency is to throw out vesicles, herpetic vesicles
        which are isolated, and the tendency of the vesicles is to form thick yellow crusts, with
        considerable moisture. The vesicles break early.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">At times the vesicles do not form crusts, but break early and ulcerate
        underneath, and this changes into a phagedenic ulcer; this condition occurs about the
        fingers, scrotum, face and scalp. There is a special tendency to produce vesicular eruptions
        about the back of the neck.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Papular, pustular, vesicular, dry, mealy eruptions, but most commonly
        moist; eruptions which extend deeply. It builds up eruptions on the site of old eruptions,
        with an increasing hardness in the base of the old eruption.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When the crust dries down it indurates, and this induration takes place
        at the margin and builds up little rings about the margin. The induration cracks, bleeds,
        looks purple. Apply this to salt rheum, and eruptions about the hands. It is suitable when
        there are cracks about the ends of the fingers and on the backs of the hands.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The skin is rough, ragged, exfoliates, cracks, bleeds; the tissues are
        hardened; this occurs sometimes about the palms of the hands and nails. This tissue
        ulcerates, and the ulcers eat and spread. All eruptions itch violently. He can not rest
        until he scratches the skin off, when the part becomes moist, bloody, raw and inflamed.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is also itching with no visible eruption. He scratches the skin
        until moisture oozes forth, and keeps on scratching until the skin bleeds and the part
        becomes cold.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">To a great extent the above condition is due to a lack of accommodation,

        while in a dark state-room. Occipital headache, with the vertigo above mentioned, and an all
