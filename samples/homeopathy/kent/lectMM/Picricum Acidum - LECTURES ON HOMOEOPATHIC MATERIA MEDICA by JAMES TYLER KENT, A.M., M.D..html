        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is progressive, passing from weariness to paralysis. The evidences of
        softening of brain and cord are strong. He, soon becomes sensitive to heat and desires the
        cool air which ameliorates his head and bodily condition.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cold air and cold bathing are grateful to him. He is sensitive to wet
        weather. Numbness of many parts, trembling, lassitude, heaviness, must lie down, worse from
        least exertion are marked features. Loss of sleep, mental, worry, mental labor, are the
        exciting causes of symptoms. Extreme indifference.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a typical brain-fag remedy with indifference and lack of will
        power, aversion to talk, think, or perform any mental exertion. He is quickly prostrated
        from the least mental work, and it brings on many complaints, such as soreness and lameness,
        diarrhea, burning along the spine, general weakness and heaviness of limbs and back. He
        loses all interest in things; becomes irritable from any mental exertion.</p>

        children we have a common use for this very valuable but neglected remedy. When the child
        begins to learn the alphabet, headaches come, and return with every repeated effort, often
        with dilated pupils. After every examination at school come these violent headaches. A young
        man at school with the following symptoms was cured promptly.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is often associated with the head pains, For headaches of students,
        teachers, professional men, and overworked business men, it is a most useful remedy. For

        rest and sleep during the night. Extreme prostration often comes with these headaches.
        Extreme sexual excitement often comes with the headache as with many of its "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">complaints</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">," but it is not an essential concomitant.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
