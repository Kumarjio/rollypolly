        think of it as spread on the wall of a room, and then remember how many become sick from

        sick.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many patients cannot sleep in a newly painted room - they come down with
        lead colic or the acute affections of lead. Many people are sensitive to lead. This
        sensitivity is more marked than is observed in painters, who may use it for years with
        impunity, but all at once become susceptible to it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">You wonder how much he gets, given off in the air. It is too attenuated
        to be examined by the microscope and yet enough to make him sick.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">We have no measure by which to find out how much he gets. We make use of
        such susceptibility, the lead palsy of lead workers, the lead colic in painters - these
        things add to the proper proving and give a well-rounded image of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Plumbum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">General paralytic state</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">:
        If we study the whole symptomatology of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Plumbum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, we will be struck with the general paralytic state
        in this remedy.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The activities of the body, the functions of the organs, are slowed down
        in pace. The nerves do not convey their messages with the usual activity. The muscles are
        slow in action, sluggish. There is first paresis and finally paralysis, of parts first and
        finally of the whole.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind is impaired, slow. Perception is slow. He memorizes with
        difficulty. Comprehension is difficult. He cannot recall words to express himself. The
        operations of the mind are slow. When in conversation with such a patient you will wonder
        what he is thinking about while making up his mind to answer.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is sluggishness also in the skin. You may prick him and a second
        later he says, "Oh", showing the slowness in feeling. You would expect him to feel
        the prick instantly. When you begin to conclude that he does not feel at all, his limb will
        jerk.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Anesthesia of the skin. There is a state of hyperesthesia in the acute
        affections, but the chronic affections are characterized by loss of sensation. Numbness of
        fingers and toes, soles, and palms, and this extends to the skin, towards the spine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The trophic functions are slow in that they do not keep up with the
        waste, and so we see emaciation until the patient becomes almost a skeleton. The skin is
        wrinkled, puckered, shriveled, and drawn over the bones. The emaciation is sometimes local.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When local it is generally associated with a painful part; the painful
        part withers. Pains down the sciatic nerve; burning, shooting; as if the bone were being
        pulled out of place; as if being scraped and the limb emaciates. Pain down the arm, in the
        shoulder; violent pains in the brachial plexus and the arm withers.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Neuralgia of one side of the face and that side withers. Paralysis of
        single muscles and these muscles wither. There is, paralysis of both extensors and flexors,
        but especially extensors. The paralysis begins in the extensors, so that we have wrist drop.
        He cannot raise or lift anything with the hand. Extension is difficult. This occurs in piano
        players; they cannot lift their fingers sufficiently rapid to keep up the pace, while
        flexion is all right. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Curare</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is another remedy which corresponds to this state in
        piano players; a paralysis from overexertion of the extensor muscles.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">When the muscles become fatigued from playing fixed exercises, scales,
        etc., for hours at a time, when the player has to do the same thing over and over again, </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">comes in, but it is an acute remedy
        and only holds for a short time.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        patient takes cold and a weakness sets in; after a cold bath or plunge the muscles take on
        paresis; getting wet when tired brings on the </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Rhus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">state.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">For the chronic state which follows, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Plumbum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and sometimes </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Curare</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> will be indicated.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Paresis of the intestines; constipation; cannot strain at stool. The
        patient can use the abdominal muscles, but the rectum is in a state of paresis and he cannot
        expel the faeces.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The bladder is also paretic; cannot expel the urine, the muscles do not
        cooperate to void the urine and there is retention. Plumbum has both retention and
        suppression of urine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The paralyses are found in the chronic state. In the acute we have the
        fever, the colic, the sudden constipation; tearing pains in the intestines; indigestion with
        vomiting. Everything eaten turns sour.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Violent vomiting of everything eaten. Chronic gastric catarrh with
        vomiting of albuminous mucus and sweetish substance. Vomiting of stercoraceous matter,
        blackish blood and green fluid. Sour eructations.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The remedy is slow and insidious; it works continuously; it does not
        leave the economy but holds on and establishes a miasm of its own. It, therefore, suits slow
        and insidious chronic cases, with no tendency to recovery. Progressive muscular atrophy;
        progressive paralysis. Chronic constipation; chronic retention of urine; chronic giving way
        of the mind.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Aside from the slowness of the mind, which is a general, the remedy is
        full of melancholia, sadness, feeling as if something terrible would happen; that she has
        sinned away the day of grace; that she has committed the unpardonable sin. The body and mind
        are weak.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Deep melancholy with timidity and restlessness,"</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the mental state, while he is slow to think, yet in this slow thinking
        he does a great amount of thinking; he makes an effort to think. His thoughts trouble him
        all night and prevent sleep. Insomnia; sleepless from the continual effort to think.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind will not operate, yet the patient is full of imaginations and
        emotions. Inability to comprehend and to remember. Now, this progresses from periods of
        insomnia to periods of coma and this coma is associated with suppression of urine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Uraemic coma. Uremia. Perhaps it will fix it in your mind if I tell you
        something clinical about it. Some years ago a physician came to me in regard to his wife.
        She had been unconscious for two days and had passed no urine for days and the catheter
        showed there was none in the bladder. She had quite an array of symptoms but they were
        common symptoms.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">She had had the slowness for days before, and complained of a sensation
        of a continual pulling at the navel, as if a string were drawing it back to the spinal
        column, and then the coma came on. In the middle of the night this doctor came to me in
        great distress. He said she was pale as death and breathing slow. A single powder of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Plumbum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> high was given, and she passed urine in a few hours, roused up and never
        had such an attack again.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Violent spasmodic palpitation of the heart, worse lying on the left side,
        with marked anxiety in the cardiac region. Hypertrophy and dilatation of the heart.
        Stitching pain in the heart.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hysterical diathesis hysterical contractures; cramping of the fingers;
        hysterical motions convulsions of parts, hands, feet, whole body; an apparent delirium;
        cardiac pains; numbness in parts - all hysterical phenomena.</p>

        of it for suicide, a confirmed hysterical state. She would be in a hysterical condition for
        hours when any one was looking at her. When she thought no one was near she would get up,
        walk about, look in the glass to see how handsome she was, but when she heard a foot on the
        steps she would, he on the bed and appear to he unconscious.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">She would bear much pricking and you could scarcely tell she was

        inclination to deceive, to feign sickness; to exaggerate one's ills; and it goes to the root
        of the evil providing the symptoms agree.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Changeable; continually changing from one thing to another, from one
        group of imaginations to another, from one group of emotions to another. The whole remedy is
        intensely emotional. While the intellect is slowed down, yet most of the symptoms are
        emotional.</p>

        muscles, the paralytic weakness of one side of the body, or single parts of the body, show
        its relation to such cases.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another feature of the upper part of the body, of the head and
        mind, which is not clear in the books and which is worthy of your attention. The mental
        symptoms, the emotional symptoms, and the head symptoms are greatly exaggerated by any
        exertion, especially exertion in the open air.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">While walking in the open air the patient becomes hot in the head, pale
        in the face, and cold in the extremities, hands and feet cold as ice, as if dead; and if he
        continues the exertion the face becomes fairly cadaveric. Persons cannot exercise and
        continue it without cold extremities.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">An irritable brain; pain in the base of the brain, back of the neck, in
        the nerve centers. Cold extremities from exertion; yet can do considerable mental exertion
        without becoming cold. It is from physical exertion like walking in the open air. Paroxysmal
        pain in the limbs, evening and night; better by pressure and worse from motion.
        Lightning-like pains. Jerking and trembling of all the limbs.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The Plumbum patient is cold and emaciated, needs much clothing even in
        warm weather, not about the head, but over the body. Extremities cold, blue, numb and
        emaciated. Sweat on the extremities, and on the feet it is stinking. Feet and toes withered
        like a washerwoman's hands. Toes blistered; blisters between the toes, smarting.
        Ulcerations. Molecular death and even gangrene of the skin of the fingers and toes. Calluses
        about the feet, corns and bunions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With the chronic affection of the head there is contraction of the
        muscles of the back and neck; drawing and twitching indicating meningeal troubles; spasmodic
        jerking.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        destroyed. Pains in the abdomen, tearing, like colic, doubling the patient up. Constant
        sensation of pulling at the navel as by a string; as if the abdomen were drawn in. At times
        the abdomen does become concave, as if the abdomen and back were too close together.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Constipation is a common and well known feature. The constipation, colic,
