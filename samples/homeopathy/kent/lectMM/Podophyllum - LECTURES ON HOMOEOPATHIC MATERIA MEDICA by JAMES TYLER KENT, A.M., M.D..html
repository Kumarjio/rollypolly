        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is seldom used except in acute affections, but it is a long
        acting and deep acting drug; it produces a powerful impression on the economy; it relates to
        the deep-seated miasms.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Abdomen</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: It affects
        profoundly the abdominal viscera. It shows its symptoms largely on the abdominal organs, the
        pelvic organs, and the liver. The abdomen seems to be the earliest seat of attack. It
        produces such an impression upon the stomach and intestinal canal that the healthy action is
        impaired, digestion and assimilation cease.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Everything taken into the stomach becomes sour. The glands of the stomach
        are as if paralyzed; there is no digestion; this goes on until we have vomiting and
        diarrhea. During this there is a wonderful disturbance in the abdomen; rumbling; gurgling as
        if animals were floundering about; clinically, as if fish were turning and tossing in a
        pond, as we have seen them before a storm.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Rumbling and rolling. This is attended with severes cramping pains
        doubling her up. Abdomen is sensitive; so sore she cannot endure pressure. The soreness
        extends to the stomach, intestines and finally to the liver. The whole abdominal viscera are
        sore, sensitive to pressure. After this comes a gurgling, watery stool, pouring out of the
        anus.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">A tremendous outpouring so that the patient wonders where all the fluid
        comes from, and soon it comes on again. Copious, enormous, and very frequent. This soreness,
        cramping, and rumbling precedes the stool, but sometimes it continues during the stool.
        Commonly the patient is relieved by the stool. There is much flatus and spluttering, but not
        so marked as in </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aloe</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The colic often comes and goes without stool. Painless stools, in which
        compare </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">China</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">which has
        stool coming on at night and after eating. Putrid or not, and of inky color. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Podophyllum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is rarely indicated when the discharge is not offensive. After a while the
        abdomen again becomes tumultuous, and this is again relieved by a stool.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This process is repeated over and over. It seems as if the blood vessels
        would empty themselves into the! abdominal cavity, and then into the outer world. Not unlike
        cholera and cholera morbus, and these two are the common manifestations of disease for which
        this remedy is used in routine practice. The cholera morbus coming on in the latter part of
        the night, especially about 3, 4, or 5 o'clock, resembles </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Podophyllum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. Tumultuous
        action of the bowels with rumbling, pain, and soreness, and the prostration is so marked
        that if not relieved in a day or two, it seems he must die. Rice-water stools, jelly-like on
        standing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Women</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: With this
        tumultuous action, she has an indescribable sensation; an all-gone feeling, a deathly sick
        feeling, described by some as an emptiness, as if fasting, yet averse to food. An awful,
        hungry, empty weakness, as if the whole intestines would drop out.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">No wonder they think so, because this remedy produces an astonishing
        amount of relaxation. Described by some as a sensation of dragging down. The uterine
        ligaments become relaxed and there is prolapsus. The rectum protrudes for inches. The
        sensation of dragging down as if all the parts would be pushed out into the world is a
        common feature. It seems to begin with the liver, as if all the parts were let down.
        Weakness attended with soreness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Dragging down in the region of the ovary and the ovary is congested. The
        uterus is extremely sore and is enlarged; sore to touch so that light clothing aggravates.
        Sensitiveness of the abdomen in diarrhea and vomiting; in cholera morbus; in women when
        menstruating. Indicated if there is a copious diarrhea during the menstrual period, and
        great soreness in the uterus. Much pain in the ovaries, in one or both, extending down the
        crural region, down the front of the thigh.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Pain in the ovaries, especially the right; pain in the ovaries during the
        menstrual period, gripping pain in the bowels during the menstrual period. Great soreness of
        the abdomen before and during the menstrual period. (</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Apis, <i>Cimicifuga, Vespa, Lachesis</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>, </i>but these are not so likely to have diarrhea and, if so, it is not
        as copious.)</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Diarrhea</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Alternating
        conditions is a feature of this remedy. If a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Podophyllum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> patient takes
        cold, has any mental excitement, overexerts himself, eats boiled food, cabbage, fruits, and
        overloads his stomach with rich food he has a diarrhea, and following this a constipation
        lasting for weeks, no stool except in lumps; difficult, scanty stool and as soon as lie
        disorders Ids stomach again comes a diarrhea. This alternating diarrhea and constipation is
        a </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Podophyllum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> state rather than a chronic diarrhea, which is a continued state
        found in many remedies. The diarrhea is periodic, alternating with constipation.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Headache</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Another
        alternating feature is the headache.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chronic headache, periodic headache, sick headache, congestive in
        character, as if all the blood were in the head, as if the head would burst, and the pains
        most violent in the back of the head, bursting, and then on comes a diarrhea which relieves
        the head.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Sometimes when the diarrhea slacks up too suddenly, a headache is the
        result. It is a common feature after giving a high potency of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Podophyllum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in a
        diarrhea, that a headache comes, on after the diarrhea is stopped. It means that the
        medicine has acted suddenly and the headache will pass away soon.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Headache alternating with liver disturbances. The patient lies on the
        side or abdomen. Rending pains towards the duodenum. You will wonder if it is not gall stone
        colic. Periodic, violent headaches; alternating diarrhea and constipation; he strokes the
        region of the liver from behind forward and in this way gets relief, yet the liver is so
        sore that he can hardly bear the pressure.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Liver</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> sensitive to
        touch.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Soreness about the liver; pain through to the back; dull aching pain,
        finally jaundice; becomes extremely yellow. Uneasiness and distress about two or three hours
        after eating, with jaundice; horrible nausea; aversion to food; empty all-gone feeling in
        the bowels.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Vomiting, greenish, profuse, watery, vomits everything; vomiting of milk
        (</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Calc., <i>Aeth</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>. - </i>the latter sometimes retains water); hunger
        after vomiting; deathly, overpowering nausea and prostration. Prolapse of rectum and anus

        troublesome.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A torpid liver is often associated with a torpid fluctuating state of the
        mind; also a slow, sluggish pulse; palpitation. Great depression of spirits, melancholia,
        sadness, dejection everything goes wrong; the clouds are very dark; there is no light;
        thinks he may die or that he is going to become ill; that his disease will become chronic;
        that he has organic disease of the heart and liver; that he has sinned away his day of
        grace, and other such delusions. Mind easily fatigued; fidgety and restless; cannot sit
        still, whole body fidgety.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">In this mental state with jaundice, all-gone sensation, aversion to food,
        even the thought or smell of food; stuffed feeling and distension in the region of the
        liver. The tongue is covered with thick slime; pasty, yellow coating as if mustard were
        spread upon it; imprint of the teeth upon the tongue; breath foul. For such a condition the
        ancients gave </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Calomel</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        digest; duodenal catarrh; catarrh of intestines with copious diarrhea. If you notice the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Podophyllum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> discharge in the commode, you will see a great amount of water, on the
        bottom a sediment like cornmeal gruel; as if cornmeal had been stirred in. If you see it
        early it is yellow, muddy, or yellow-green, profuse, offensive, cadaverous; the odor
        penetrates the whole house; stool gushes away like water from a bung-bole; gurgling and much
        flatus.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">With the stool there is very commonly a prolapse of the rectum; a gush of
        watery stool and a prolapse of the rectum; a soft stool with great straining and a prolapse
        of the rectum.</p>
