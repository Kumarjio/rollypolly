        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This course of lectures
        on the Homeopathic Materia Medica was delivered at the Post-Graduate
        School of Homoeopathics.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them have
        appeared in the journal of <i>Homoeopathics, </i>but for this work they
        have been extensively revised.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Owing to the strong
        appeals of students, though against the author's inclination, the
        colloquial style has been permitted to stand.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lectures are
        presented in the simple form to explain the author's plan of studying
        each remedy.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The speech of laymen
        presents all sickness to the physician's mind, hence the Materia Medica
        must be reduced from technicalities to simple speech. No two remedies
        are studied exactly alike. Each has its own requirement in order to
        bring before the mind what is characteristic.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all of the Materia
        Medica has been brought out, but the leading and fully proved remedies
        such as have strong characteristics have been presented for the purpose
        of showing how the Materia Medica must be evolved and used.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are other methods
        of studying a remedy, but this seems to the author the most natural way
        of giving to the student a lasting idea of the nature of each remedy. It
        may be that it seems so because it is the only way the author could ever
        do it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous
        repetitions of characteristic symptoms may subject the work to
        criticism, but experience has shown that it is the only way of giving
        the beginner a lasting grasp of the remedy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font>Hahnemann's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> Materia Medica Pura, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hering's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> Guiding Symptoms, and the Encyclopedia of Pure
        Materia Medica have been the works that have given the most help in
        these studies.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are not offered as
        being complete digests of the various remedies, but simply as the
        examinations of some of the most salient points.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A complete digest would
        be endless. If some of the younger practitioners and students of the
        Materia Medica shall meet the assistance in this work they have been
        looking for, it is all that can be expected. There is no royal road to a
        perfect understanding of the Materia Medica.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is tedious and
        drudgery at best, but no more so than any great science. Because of its
        greatness, many will fail to undertake it even when it is for the saving
        of life and lessening of suffering, yet many will not decline to offer
        their services to the people knowing full well and confessing ignorance
        openly that the methods they offer are inadequate, useless, and often
        destructive.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some profess not to
        believe in this careful way of analyzing the symptomatology, but if some
        easy method is offered for a pretended mastery of it they wildly embrace
        it only to return to their primitive repulsive mental aversion crying
        out "sour grapes."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Materia Medica can
        be learned by careful study and by using it. It can be understood but
        not memorized.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who would memorize
        the Materia Medica must ignominiously fail. To be constantly at hand, it
        must be constantly and correctly used. The continuous study of the
        Materia Medica by the aid of a full repertory for comparison is the only
        means of continuing in a good working knowledge.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To learn the Materia
        Medica, one must master </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hahnemann's</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> Organon, after which the symptomatology and. the
        Organon go "hand in hand." The Organon, the symptomatology,
        and a full repertory must be the constant reference books, if careful
        homeopathic prescribing is to be, attained and maintained.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All who wish to make a
        more extensive examination of the reason for the methods used in the
        work are referred to the chapter on value of symptoms in the Lectures on
        Homoeopathic Philosophy.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">These lectures were first published because of the
        numerous requests from pupils who had listened to them in classroom. Now
        comes a demand for a second editing which preserves its original
        colloquial style which was used by the lecturer in the classroom. Many
        remedies have been added and the whole work has been revised.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many remedies are in a new and later form of
        presentation. While the "symptom list" is a most important
        form in the homoeopathic Materia Medica, yet it is hard to grasp the
        idea of the remedy from that form when it is listened to by students.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The author has adopted a <i>quasi </i>clinical method
        of stating and grouping symptoms in a manner to bring out an image of
        each remedy. This is done in order that pupils may <i>understand </i>a
        remedy as a whole and in parts rather than tire the memory which is
        always overworked in a medical college.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The "symptom list" will always remain the
        best form for a reference text, but it has been observed by long
        teaching that many pupils who fail to grasp the remedy from the list
        learn the Materia Medica well in the <i>quasi </i>clinical and
        colloquial form.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If these lectures shall enable some practitioners to
        more fully comprehend our polychrests then all that has been hoped for
        has been gained. It is believed that the human mind is only able to hold
        a general image of each remedy.</p>
