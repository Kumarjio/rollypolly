        body, especially of the face, looks filthy, though it has been well washed. A dingy, dirty,
        foul look, as if covered with dirt.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Skin rough and uneven, cracks easily, bleeding fissures; it becomes rough
        and scaly. He cannot wash it clean. The skin of the hands is rough, chaps easily, becomes
        thick and scaly, easily cracks; breaks out in little scaly, eruptions; looks unwashed; he
        always<i> a</i>ppears to have dirty hands.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many of the complaints of the skin are worse from bathing and from the
        warmth of the bed. The skin itches when warm; itches when wearing woolens. Itching when warm
        in bed; he scratches until the part becomes raw, and then it becomes scabby. When healing
        takes place there is itching and then it becomes scabby. When healing takes place there is
        itching and then he has to scratch. Legs and arms raw and scabby from scratching. Violent
        itching from the warmth of the bed, even, without any eruption.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The skin is unhealthy, looks dirty, dingy, studded with capillary blood
        vessels and enlarged veins. This is the state before the eruption appears. Scabs form from
        scratching and then comes the eruption.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Papules, pimples, crusts, boils, vesicles, and eruptions ooze a watery
        moisture. When the eruption has gone on for some time the crusty formation and vesicles
        mingle; the skin becomes thickened and indurated, and new crops come out under the old
        crusts; rawness, itching, tingling, crawling, bleeding eczema of the scalp and face; the
        crusts cover the scalp; the hair falls out; the oozing lifts up the crusts and exposes new
        vesicles; it looks like raw beef, and it tingles so that the child cannot keep its fingers
        off it; worse at night, worse from the warmth of the bed, worse from warm applications,
        anything that would keep the air away from it; ameliorated by cool air and worse from
        covering. This is the opposite of the general </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Psorinum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> state, which is
        aggravated from the open air. He has an aversion to open air.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The eruption goes on, spreads, and the true skin becomes elevated,
        thickened, indurated, with an increased vascularity and redness. The oozing is offensive
        like carrion or decomposed meat; nauseating odor from the oozing fluid.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Offensiveness runs through </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Psorinum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> in such a
        characteristic way that is worth while mentioning it here; foetid odors, foetid breath
        discharges and oozing from the skin smelling like carrion; stool so offensive that the odor
        permeates the whole house, in diarrhea, summer complaint, cholera infantum; perspiration
        foetid; leucorrhoea abominably offensive; eructations taste as if be had eaten bard boiled
        eggs and they had spoiled, and they smell so to others; stool flatus, and eructations smell
        like spoiled eggs; offensive to sight and smell is the subject who needs this medicine.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The skin grows increasingly thick and bleeds, and the eruption spreads to
        other parts. Eruptions on the lips, on the genitals; very offensive; soreness and rawness
        about the anus; the vulva ulcerates and is very offensive; ulcers on the legs; on the tibia;
        on the backs of the hands; on the dorsum of the foot; behind the ears and upon the ears;
        over the scalp; over the cheek bones; on the wings of the nose and on the nose and eyelids.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Greasy skin. The eruption is accompanied by redness of the mucous
        membranes of the nose, mouth, lips and eyes. Eyelids thickened and turned out, like
        ectropion; granulation and induration of mucous membranes, so that they become like gristle;
        redness and ulceration. Ulceration of the cornea; lachrymation; turning out of the lids with
        loss of the eyelashes.</p>

        looks frightful with his red eyes, eruption on the face, red skin oozing a thick yellow
        discharge. In the early stages the oozing is a whitish thin or whitish thick moisture. In
        old eruptions ulceration takes place beneath the crusts and there is a thick, yellow,
        purulent discharge. Yellow green discharge from the eyes and nose. Horribly offensive
        discharge from the nose; gluey discharge from the nose; offensive like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Merc., Sil., Calc. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">p., Hep.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Accumulation of foetid pus in the eyes. Coryza with thick, yellow
        discharge. Always taking cold. In the coryza, the nose dries up part of the time and runs
        part of the time; he must use the handkerchief continually; must blow the nose all the time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the early stages of the coryza he blows it all the time, but there is
        no discharge or relief. This state is so marked that some think of it as a continuous hay
        fever, which runs all the year and rippens up in the Fall.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is closely related to hay fever; stuffing up of the nose in the Fall;
        catarrhal state of the eyes and nose. Hay fever is one of the most difficult conditions to
        fit a remedy to. It belongs to a low constitution which must be built up before the hay
        fever will cease.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is an expression of psora which comes once a year, and the psoric
        miasm must be changed. In a few years most subjects can be changed, but not in one season,
        so do not be disappointed. In catarrhal states, hay fever often dates back to low fever
        improperly treated.</p>
