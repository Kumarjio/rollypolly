        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">She is tearful, plethoric, and generally has little credit for being sick
        from her appearances; yet she is most nervous, fidgety, changeable, easily led and easily
        persuaded. While she </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">is mild, gentle </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and <i>tearful</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"><i>, </i>yet she is remarkably irritable, not in the sense of pugnacity, but
        easily irritated, extremely touchy, always feels slighted or fears she will be slighted;
        sensible to every social influence.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Melancholia, sadness, weeping, despair, religious despair, fanatical;
        full of notions and whims; imaginative; extremely excitable. She imagines the company of the
        opposite sex a dangerous thing to cultivate, and that it is dangerous to do certain things
        well established in society as good for the human race.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">These imaginations belong to eating as well as thinking. They imagine
        that milk is not good to drink, so they will not take it. They imagine that certain articles
        of diet are not good for the human race. Aversion to marriage is a strong symptom. A man
        takes it into his head that it is an evil thing to have sexual intercourse with his wife and
        abstains from it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Religious freaks; an especial tendency to dwell on religious notions;
        fixed ideas concerning the Scripture; he misuses and misapplies the Scriptures to his own
        detriment; dwells on sanctification until he becomes fanatical and insane; thinks he is in a
        wonderfully sanctification state of mind, or that he has sinned away his day of grace.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This goes no until he becomes insane on other subjects, and then the
        tendency is to sit day after day in a taciturn way. He will not answer questions unless hard
        pressed, when all he will say is "Yes" or "No," or be will merely shake
        his head. Puerperal insanity in a woman who was mild, gentle and tearful, later sad and
        taciturn, and then she sits in her chair all day answering nothing or merely nodding her
        head for "Yes" or "No."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many of the complaints are associated with weakness of the stomach and
        indigestion, or with menstrual disorders. Women who abort; various irregularities of the
        menstrual flow; false conception. The mental symptoms are often associated with the ovarian
        and uterine difficulties.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Suffocation and an increase of the pains, and even chilliness in a warm
        room; a nervous chilliness when the patient perspires from the heat of a room. The
        inflammatory symptoms, neuralgias and rheumatisms are relieved by a cold, by eating and
        drinking cold things, by cold applications, or cold hands. Cold drinks relieve, even though

        symptoms worse after eating. It is often only a lump in the stomach, but the mental and
        nervous symptoms also are worse after eating. The stomach symptoms are worse in the morning,
        the mental symptoms worse in the evening. </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Aggravation from fats </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">and

        not know much about his hay fever. If you suggest several things he has them all. In nearly
        all these acute expressions you do not find in the exaggerated attack the symptoms that will

        will find spinal symptoms; great soreness in the back relieved by lying on something hard.
        Few remedies have that. They do not tell you that at first but continue to dwell on the bay
