        dock, is a neglected remedy, and one that has been only partially proved.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mental symptoms have not been brought out, but the catarrhal symptoms
        have been well expressed by provers.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a state of sadness, low spirited; aversion to work; irritable
        mental excitability. This includes about all the mental state we know of this remedy, as the
        provings were made with the lower potencies and tincture.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The yellow dock has been used in domestic practice, as a blood medicine,
        to cure eruptions and boils. When used in this way it is a mild substance, and hence the
        provings are somewhat in this form.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The catarrhal tendency is very striking. The nose, eyes, chest and
        trachea, the whole respiratory tract, gives forth a copious flow, copious mucous discharge.
        I have seen it so copious from the nose that it seemed as one continuous flow; so copious
        from the trachea and bronchial tubes that the patient continually hawked up, by the
        mouthful, thin frothy, white mucus, so that in a little while as much as half a pint of thin
        mucus, as thin as water, would be in the cuspidor. It also has marked dryness of the larynx
        and trachea with hard, dry, spasmodic cough.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">At times it has taken the form of grippe, with a copious mucous
        discharge; thin, watery, frothy expectoration by the mouthful. This is only the first stage.
        Following this the discharge becomes thick, yellow, tough or thick, white and tenacious; so
        ropy and stringy and tough that in spite of blowing the nose and coughing he fails to get it
        up. Completely exhausted from his efforts to expectorate the tough, stringy, tenacious even
        gluey mucus. This catarrhal state is commonly accompanied by a morning diarrhea, and these
        constitute the leading features.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Catarrhal headache with great irritation of the larynx and trachea,
        clavicular pain and soreness behind sternum."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Catarrhal headaches are headaches that come on during spells of dryness,
        alternating with a copious flux. Extreme rawness in the larynx and trachea; burning and
        smarting; unable to endure pressure on the throat pit.</p>
        </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Tickling in the throat pit causing cough</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Must sit
        without motion; cannot breathe deeply, hurriedly or irregularly because the burning is so
        much increased by any change in breathing.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If he steps into the open air a paroxysmal cough takes his breath away;
        or if he passes from the open air into a warm room the same paroxysmal cough comes on. The
        paroxysm is so violent that in the morning, when he has a loose stool, he will pass it
        involuntarily with the cough. The urine also passes away with the cough. The headache
        returns when the discharges slack up.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A striking feature is pain under the clavicle; a sense of rawness under
        the clavicle; as if the parts inside were raw; as if the air came directly under the
        clavicle, producing rawness and burning. Rawness and burning from the inhalation of air.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Nose obstructed; dry sensation even in posterior nares."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many times the coryza starts out by a marked dryness in the posterior
        nares, so that he is constantly hawking; the irritation is so great that he cannot let it
        alone. There is a sensation of thickening in the nasopharynx, and he produces a peculiar
        noise in trying to get rid of it.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sudden sharp tingling sensation in Schneiderian membrane."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is intense; tingling, sometimes described as an itching extending
        from the end of the nose to the pharynx; sometimes forces sneezing, blowing the nose and
        this peculiar noise, and sometimes a hawking to get the mucus when it isi a little lower in
        the pharynx; hemming to get rid of it when in the larynx. The inflammation passes to the
        smallest bronchi, producing a capillary bronchitis and finally a pneumonia.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It suits acute and chronic catarrhal states. In old phthisical cases
        every time be takes a cold, he is so sensitive to cold air and change of air that he sleeps
        with the bed clothes over his mouth. Every breath of air causes a spasmodic cough.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The early expectoration is thin mucus, and then it becomes thicker and
        tenacious, and he cannot expectorate it; he hears the rattle, after many efforts which
        exhaust him; he expectorates a little with hardly any relief. This is a great remedy to do
        patch work with in phthisis. Soreness, rawness and burning, especially down the trachea and
        tinder the sternum.</p>
