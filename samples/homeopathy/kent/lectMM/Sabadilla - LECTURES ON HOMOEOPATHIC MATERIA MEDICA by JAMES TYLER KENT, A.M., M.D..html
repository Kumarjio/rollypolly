        <p align="JUSTIFY">Discharge at first of thin mums and later thick mucus. It has all the
        appearance of a coryza. The coryza is ameliorated from inhaling hot air. He sits before an
        open grate or register, with the head close to it, inhaling the hot air. Especially useful
        when the catarrhal state of the nose is prolonged; a prolonged coryza, which does not yield
        to ordinary remedies; a lingering coryza, and the discharge is exaggerated by the odor of
        flowers. Even thinking of the odor of flowers makes him sneeze and increases the flow from
        the nose. So thinking of various things aggravates his complaints.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Many hay fever patients are sensitive to the odor of flowers, to the,
        odor of the hay field, to dying vegetable matter; so oversensitive to the odor of fruit are
        some that apples have to be removed from the house. Inhalation of odors that are beautiful,
        as that of the lavender, some hay fever patients cannot tolerate; such things may bring on
        an attack out of the season. Now </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sabadilla</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is of this sort oversensitive to surroundings, to
        odors; these increase the catarrhal state of the throat and posterior nares.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sneezing and a flow of mucus from the nose; goes on even to ulceration.
        Periodical attacks; a rose cold in June; in autumn about August 20 as a hay fever. Hay fever
        is often an easy thing to palliate with short acting remedies; they will cut short an attack
        in a few days. But the cure requires years, and the patient must be treated in the interim
        and according to his symptoms. When the hay fever symptoms are present he has no others; one
        group is manifested at one time, and another group at another time. But the patient is sick
        and all the symptoms must be gathered together and the case treated accordingly.</p>

        or himself are strange. Imagines the body is withering, that the limbs are crooked, that the

        believes it even in spite of her vision. It is a sensation which she believes, a delusion,
        an insanity.</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The imaginations are groundless; nothing is visible, and the suffering is
        greater than if there was something to be seen. These patients often get no sympathy; they

        <p align="JUSTIFY">There are but a few remedies which have fixed ideas; these ideas may be
        concerning religion, politics, clothing, things of the family and life. I once had an insane

        <p align="JUSTIFY">But these are not the constitutional remedies; they do not cure, but only
        palliate during the severe attacks. These symptoms are the outcome of the psoric
        constitution, and this constitution must be treated by antipsorics. Sometimes the hay fever
        is so severe that it seems to be the only manifestation of psora in the patient, but if it
        is restrained or stopped up by bad treatment he is not well during the whole year.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If let alone he has good health during the rest of the year. Many a time
        the hay fever goes through the whole winter and only by constitutional up building can it be
        mitigated. But with constitutional treatment each yearly attack is lighter, and at the end
        of treatment he is able to live in his own climate unaffected.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He must not go to the mountains to mitigate it. If to any place, he
        should go where the affection would be worse, so that all its manifestations would be
        apparent. The hay fever will only be cured if </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">the patient is curable</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">,
        but if not, if his constitution is so broken down that he<i> </i>is incurable, his hay fever
        will not be cured.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The most striking place of attack is the mucous membrane of the nose,
        throat, trachea and larynx. Violent acute inflammation of the mucous membrane of these
        parts.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The appetite is singular; it is commonly seen in pregnant women. She says
        she is never hungry; never wants anything to eat, and often there is an aversion to food;
        but when, from a matter of reason, she concludes to eat, and she takes a mouthful, it tastes
        good, it recalls the appetite, and she makes a good meal. At other times not only a loss of
        appetite, but a disgust and loathing of food.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">

        tape worms. A careful prescriber never thinks of prescribing for worms. He takes all the
        symptoms of the patient and these guide him to the remedy. I remember one time in a lady's
        house seeing a dog drag his hinder parts over the carpet as if to scratch the anus. She
        said:</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Doctor, can't you give the dog a remedy?"</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Doctor, what did you give the dog that medicine for?"</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is true that worms will not prosper in a perfectly healthy stomach,
        intestine or rectum. They can only thrive in the unhealthy. Many a time I have had a patient
        bring me a tape-worm in a bottle after I had put them on an antipsoric, even when I did not
        suspect its existence.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Turn the economy into order and the parasites go. The same applies to
        germs. They only exist as a result of disease. They have never been known to exist without
        the disease having first existed. If you ignore the worm, but select the remedy on the
        totality of the symptoms, the patient will be restored to health, and, so far as the worm is
        concerned, go without a symptom.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The worm becomes smaller, shrivels and finally departs. It is rarely the
        case for the worm to disappear inside of six weeks after the remedy. If, on the other hand,
        you eject the worm by violent means, the patient may go for years with troublesome symptoms,
        and you do not know why you fail to cure him.</p>
        <p align="justify">Prescribe for the patient first. No results of disease should be removed
        until proper constitutional treatment has been resorted to, and be sure that it is proper.</p>
