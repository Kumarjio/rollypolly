        it manifests itself in a dazed state, he is unable to comprehend, the mind is slow, it is a
        weakness bordering on imbecility, which in the end it may reach. Weakness of the mind and
        the tissues.</p>

        Weakness and dilatation of the veins, tendency to form varices in the limbs, varicose

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The face is often red and discolored in patches. When the circulation is
        feeble the parts turn blue, over the shin bones; on the backs of the feet, toes; blue spots

        backs of the hands and elsewhere.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Moist, itching, scurfy, and scabby eruptions. The skin of the backs and
        the palms of the hands becomes thick and indurated with a bran like scurf resembling
        psoriasis, intermingling with blue spots.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy has many features as to cold and heat. The use of heat
        internally aggravates all complaints, but there is an external coldness relieved by heat;
        taking warm food and drink aggravates; wants cold food, but heat applied externally is
        grateful.</p>

        and I took charge of his case. His symptoms called for </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Sars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. The enormous amount
        of sand he passed in the next year was wonderful. It mitigated the catarrh and kept the
        bladder comfortable. At the end of a year, after a night of great suffering, he passed a
        stone the size of a pea. He passed several small stones after that and then returned to

        sand continued to pass, but was held in solution and deposited only on cooling. In the
