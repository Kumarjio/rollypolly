        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is indicated in persons who are debilitated from taking cold and who
        have become rheumatic, run down, victims of pain.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Hardly a nerve in the body escapes; shooting, burning, tearing, neuralgic
        pains; they are most marked about the eyes and jaws, neck, face, teeth, shoulders, burning
        like hot needles through the face and neck in any direction, stitching, tearing, worse from
        motion, from doing anything, even thinking, mental exertion, worse from eating.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains in the neck and shoulders are better from heat; those about the
        eyes are better from cold. Shooting, tearing pains in the extremities like hot wires.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes the pains are worse from lying down, but most commonly better
        from keeping still; worse from light, eating, motion, jarring; so sore in the painful region
        that any gentle exercise like going up or down stairs, or riding in a carriage that jar,
        makes the pain unbearable.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Routine practice limits the use of the remedy to this region. Worse from
        hard pressure though sometimes better from it, if gentle and prolonged, firm pressure, but
        any movement of the pressing hand aggravates. The part is turgesced and inflamed. Eyes red

        there is intercostal neuralgia; tearing pains shooting into the shoulders and neck,
        especially the left side and down the arm. Pains shooting hither and thither.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Irregularity of the heart. Painful complaints associated with valvular
        troubles, especially growing out of rheumatism. Pericarditis and endocarditis of rheumatic
        character. Thrusting pains in the chest like a knife, in the eye like a knife.</p>

        stitching in the head; sometimes better lying with the head high; worse from stooping,
        motion, and from noise.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes better from washing in cold water when the pain is about the
        eyes and head, but worse after washing; better while the cold water is applied. With these
        headaches and neuralgias there is stiff neck and shoulders, an apparent stiffness in that he
        cannot move on account of pain.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">He sits in a chair as if transfixed, is aggravated from noise, light,
        from seeing things move in the room, which he must follow with his eyes.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Fine burning, tearing pains in the brain."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It seems to be in the brain, but is more likely in the nerves of the
        scalp.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Violent pain in the left parietal bone on motion or walking or
        making a misstep; toward evening-violent pressure and pressing outward in the forehead,
        worse from stooping, worse from pressure with the hand; tensive tearing pain in the
        forehead, especially beneath the frontal eminence, extending towards orbitis."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Notice the intensity of the pains. Burrowing, tearing pain in the
        occiput, in the left side of the vertex and forehead, worse from motion, from loud noise,
        and when he speaks loudly or even on opening the mouth slightly; better when lying down.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pressive pain in the right side of the forehead, involving the right eye,
        in the morning in bed, but still more after rising; pain deeply seated, unaffected by
        pressure, very acute on motion, on suddenly turning the head, the brain seemed to be loose;
        worse from every joy, step, or straining at stool.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">When moving the muscles of the face, there is a sensation as if the head
        would burst. Sensation as if a band were about the head. Neuralgic pain settles in and above
        the left eye, or below it, from cold in damp, rainy weather; hyperesthesia of the filaments
        of the fifth pair.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">On the pain first beginning there is not so much hyperesthesia, but as it
        goes on this increases and the eye becomes congested. I have seen the pains so severe that
        they produced perfect prostration, cold sweat, vomiting.</p>

        the eye, often radiating in every direction from one point. Eye-ball sensitive to touch.
        Eyes worse when thinking about them. Worse at night. Intolerable, pressing pain, worse on
        turning the eye, dizzy on attempting to move the eyes, must turn the whole head to see.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Pain radiates to the frontal sinuses and head. Sensation as if the eye
        were too large for its orbit. I remember a patient who had been traveling about from oculist
        to oculist, who had many visual troubles and no glasses would suit.</p>
