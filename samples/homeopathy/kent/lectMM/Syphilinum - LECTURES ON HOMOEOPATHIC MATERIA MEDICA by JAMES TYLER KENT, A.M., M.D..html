        <p align="JUSTIFY">Whenever the symptoms that are representative of the patient himself have
        been suppressed in any case of syphilis, and nothing remains but weakness and a few results
        of the storm that has long ago or recently passed, this nosode will cause reaction and
        restore order and sometimes do much curing, and the symptoms that must always be present,
        that represent the disordered state of the economy will appear to guide to a restoration of
        health.</p>

        very slow in convalescing, but a single dose of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Syphilinum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> high will

        bring back the ulcers in the throat and the eruptions. When there are violent neuralgias of
        the head, in sides of head and over the eyes, great soreness in bones of legs and head, and
        the multitude of symptoms of nerve syphilis all nondescript, then it is that the patient
        will be made free from suffering, and given sleep, strength and appetite.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But the ulcers and eruptions will come back in some cases, and it is all
        the better if they do. It is by no means limited to patients who have had syphilis. It can
        be used like any remedy against the symptoms of the provings, or such as are similar to
        symptoms common to the disease or against the symptoms like the numerous verified clinical
