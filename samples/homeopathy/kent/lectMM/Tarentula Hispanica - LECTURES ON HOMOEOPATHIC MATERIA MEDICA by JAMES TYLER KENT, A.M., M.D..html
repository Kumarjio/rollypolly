        <p align="JUSTIFY">This terrible poison should never be used except in attenuations.</p>

        indescribable and too numerous to mention.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Anxiety and restlessness are words that prevail through all the
        conditions in it. It is much like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. The anxiety is felt sometimes in the mind, sometimes
        in the whole body, sometimes in the limbs and in the stomach.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cardiac anxiety is a strong feature. A strong aversion to colors, such as
        green, red and black. Depraved imaginations prevail through all the proving. Loss of all
        shame.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Desire to run about, to dance and jump up and down. Great fantastic
        dancing. Sometimes, music ameliorates all the symptoms and it other times it aggravates
        them. He becomes violently excited from music.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Emaciation is so marked that it may be said sometimes that the flesh
        falls off from him. Creeping and crawling in the skin all over the body. Paralysis of any
        part of the body, or of all the limbs.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Trembling and jerking convulsions. It has an appearance very much like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">St. Vitus' Dance</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and hence has cured chorea when it was better from music. But it will also
        cure when worse from music.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">The extreme restlessness of the limbs is like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., and it is
        a deep acting medicine like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., and it sometimes has cured where </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.

        arms, legs, trunk and head. Restlessness of the limbs in the evening, in bed before going to
        sleep, like </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ars</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. and </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Lyc</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is full of pains in the body and limbs; pains in the bones; pains in
        the. arms and in the joints. Periodicity is so well marked that it has been a marked
        curative remedy in intermittent fevers with restlessness of limbs, with aching of the bones,
        with stitching pains, with the anxiety, especially when these come in the evening and the
        fever lasts all night.</p>

        patient himself is always sensitive to cold, so the pains in the limbs are worse in cold air
        and from becoming cold.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cold damp weather aggravates all the symptoms. Walking in the open air
