        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">As we continue to study </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Thuja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, we see that it has
        a profound action upon the glands, stitching, tearing pains in the glands, the pains are as
        if the gland were being torn to pieces. That may be true of glands in general, but one
        particular gland, the ovary, is more affected than any other and especially the left.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Women</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: This is so
        true, that if you meet a violent pain in the left ovary, coming on at the time of
        menstruation and continuing during the flow and extending down the thighs, but may be in
        every direction, it increases as the flow comes on, stinging, tearing, burning, bursting
        pains, as if the parts were being torn out, make her cry aloud, she goes into a hysterical
        state. This a very strong </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Thuja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> group. It has the opposite of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Zinc., and Lachesis</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, for in these, relief comes with the flow.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Many women suffer from grumbling pains in the ovaries all the time, they
        have a sense of the organ, which they should not feel; pain from taking cold or in change of
        weather; the increase of the pain in the left ovary is the first sign; sometimes the pain is
        so severe that the right one suffers apparently, from sympathy. Where the ovaries have been
        affected for some time there will be mental symptoms, a most violent irritability, jealous,
        quarrelsomeness, ugliness.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This irritability is likely to been shown towards individuals about the
        house, toward the husband and the mother; she is yet able to control herself among strangers
        and the doctor may not be able to find out about it, because she has in her nature a
        disposition to cheat; she wants to be alone and takes upon herself fixed ideas; that she is
        pregnant, or that an animal is in her bowels, she is followed, or that someone is walking
        beside her, thinks that soul and body are separated.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, these are fixed ideas, and there is no use trying to reason them out
        of her. It seems to her that she is very delicate, that she is made of glass and that she
        will break. The idea is that she will break, and not that she is transparent.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Associated with this conditions, we have violent, intense, tearing
        headaches, tearing in the eye, ameliorated by heat. The eye-ball pains are better from heat
        and the rest are better in the cool open air.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Pain localized in small spots. A nail driven in the head, side of head
        and forehead, like </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Ignatia</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> and </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Anacardium</font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. These
        pains are intensified into tearing pains, and affect the eye-ball, making it so sore that it
        can hardly be touched; worse from heat and worse from lying down; worse in a warm room and
        better in the open air.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Rheumatic head symptoms are worse in damp air. They are worse from sour
        things and also from stimulating and exciting things.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Crude drugs do not impress the vital force, so lastingly, but an
        individual who is thoroughly sensitive and properly sensitive, as sensitive of contagion,
        then if you undertake to prove by giving it night and morning, you will rivet upon him a
        life-long miasm.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">If you have given a medicine, wait for the symptoms to come and go in the
        natural manner. To a great extent t, this is the tendency with sycosis, the tendency is
        rather outward.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">We see in the proving of a drug what we see in disease. When a gonorrhoea
        is contracted, it goes through the prodromal period and then comes the disease, which, if
        let alone, has in its nature a tendency to eradicate itself from the economy, and then the
        patients do not suffer from lasting conditions.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the old school, they always suppress the discharge, and there are
        those in the new school who do little better.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The frequent repetition by which one is exposed, would not increase the
        gonorrhea itself, because the susceptibility is satisfied.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The taking of more of the drug to prove it does not do so much harm,
        provided the one who is directing the proving realizes when the symptoms begin to rise, and
        then stops the drug.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now if we go on with the proving by repeating the doses after the
        symptoms come on, we force the drug into the economy when he is already poisoned, and by
        this means we get a confusion in the symptoms, the drug disease engrafted upon that
        individual for life.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Many of the provings of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Thuja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> give us that kind
        of confusion, so that we see only now and then symptoms cropping out that are striking; in
        fact, the great bulk of the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Thuja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> provings has been wasted, because there is so much
        confusion in the great number of symptoms, while the earlier provings brought out many of
        the characteristics, the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Vienna</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> provings, to a great extent, confused the image of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Thuja</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">There is also a general catarrhal condition running through the body;

        hacking cough, with expectoration in the morning of greenish mucus, sometimes a copious
        expectoration. It is often suited to old cases of pneumonia, in such individuals as have
