        <p align="JUSTIFY">You will be astonished at the wonderful coldness running through this
        remedy.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Coldness</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: Hardly a
        group of symptoms will arise without this accompanying coldness. Coldness of discharges,
        coldness of the body. You would also wonder at the remarkable prostration attending the
        various groups of symptoms, complete relaxation and exhaustion, coldness. Profuse sweat,
        vomiting and diarrhea.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Profuse watery discharges. These conditions occur without apparent
        provocation. In cholera or cholera morbus, it seems that the fluids run out of the body.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Lies in bed, relaxed prostrated, cold to the finger-tips, with
        corresponding blueness, fairly purple; lips cold and blue, countenance pinched and shrunken;
        great sensation of cold ness as if the blood were ice-water; scalp cold; forehead covered
        with cold sweat; headache and exhaustion; coldness in spots over the body; extremities cold
        as death. Full of cramps; looks as if he would die.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">This state comes out during the menses, during colic with nausea, with
        mania and violent delirium, with headache, with violent inflammations. Is it any wonder that
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Hahnemann</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> predicted that </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Veratrum,

        become remedies in the cure of cholera; he saw in their nature the ability to cure.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">He saw the similitude. In cases of this sort which are characterized by
        superabundance of cramps, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Cuprum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is the simillimum. For those with coldness and
        blueness and scanty sweat, vomiting, and purging, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is the remedy.
        These are called "</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">dry cholera</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">;" they sink down and die without exhaustive
        discharges. In proportion as there are coldness, blueness and scanty discharges, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Camphor</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is indicated. In proportion as copiousness, blueness, and coldness are
        present, </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Veratrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> is indicated. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Secale</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> has something of

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" color="#ff0000">Mind</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">: The mental
        symptoms are marked by violence and destructiveness he wants to destroy, to tear something;
        he tears the clothes from the body.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Always wants to be busy, to carry on his daily work. A cooper who was
        suffering from the </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Veratrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> insanity would pile up chairs on top of one another.
        When asked what he was doing, he replied that he was piling up staves. When not occupied
        with this he was tearing his clothes, or praying for hours on his knees, and so loud that he
        could be heard blocks away.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Exalted state of religious frenzy, believes he is the risen Christ
        screams and screeches until he is blue in the face; head cold as ice, cold sweat, reaches
        out and exhorts to repentance. Exhorts to repent, preaches, howls, sings obscene songs,
        exposes the person. Fear and the effects of fear; fear of death and of being damned;
        imagines the world is on fire.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Mania with desire to cut and tear everything, especially the
        clothes, with lewdness and lascivious talk.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Puerperal mania and convulsions, with violent cerebral congestion; bluish
        and bloated face; protruding eyes; wild shrieks, with disposition to bite and tear.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Loquacity, he talks rapidly.</p>

        howling and screaming or sits brooding, wailing and weeping."</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Alternate states of brooding, screaming, and screeching. A few such
        remedies would empty our insane asylums, especially of recent cases.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Insanity is curable if there are no incurable results of disease. Full of
        despair and hopelessness with approaching insanity.</p>
        </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Despair of his recovery, attempts suicide."</p>

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Insane people are not hopeless, those approaching insanity are but after
        they become insane, they think that everybody is crazy except themselves. Those bowed down
        by great grief and despair are likely to go into a state of violent mania. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Veratrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> carries them through the state of despair.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Young girls go on for years with menstrual difficulties, and preceding
        each menstrual nisus is a state of despair; never smiles, the world seems blue, everything
        is dark; these are preparing for a marked state of insanity.</p>

        that would keep many women out of the insane asylum, especially those with uterine troubles.
        Girls at puberty suffer with dysmenorrhoea, hysterical mental states, diarrhea, and
        vomiting. During the menses they become cold as death, lips blue, extremities cold and blue,
        dreadful pains, sensation of sinking, mania to kiss everybody, hysteria with coldness at the
        menstrual period, copious sweat, vomiting, and diarrhoea, etc.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Vomiting and retching after the stomach is empty; spasmodic retching and

        a mouthful of bile comes up.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Violent rush of blood to the head, congestion of the head with coldness

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">I remember a farmer who consulted me in the Summer. He had strange
        sensation when he drank water, as if it ran down the outside and did not go down the
        oesophagus. It was so marked that he I requested his friends to see if it did not run down
        the outside. </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Veratrum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff"> 2 M. cured him. No remedy has produced that
