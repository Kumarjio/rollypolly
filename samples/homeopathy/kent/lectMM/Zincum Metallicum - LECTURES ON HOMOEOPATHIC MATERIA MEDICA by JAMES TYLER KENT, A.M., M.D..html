        approaches puberty and it is time for the menses to be established, but the flow does not
        appear, she goes into a decline; she begins to manifest choreic symptoms, jerking and
        twitching, soreness in the back of the neck, burning of the whole spine, creeping and

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Tendency to be docile, but when aroused irascible. If the child comes
        down with scarlatina or measles, it goes into a stupor. The eruption does not come out.
        There is a tendency to convulsions, drawing in the extremities, suppression of urine,
        rolling of the head from one side to the other, and from stupor it goes into complete

        <p align="JUSTIFY">The intestines are sluggish. The rectum becomes impacted. Difficult

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Limbs paralyzed; paresis and finally paralysis of one or both sides
        jerking, trembling and prostration. Shocks and jerking during Sleep.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Trophic centers in a state of anaemia; emaciation throughout the body;
        the skin looks withered; the face pallid, wrinkled, unhealthy, sickly. Always chilly;
        sensitive to the cold. Full of neuralgic pains; tearing pains in all parts of the body when
        exposed to a draft; tension and drawing in various places.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Strange drawing about the eyes as if strabismus would come on; drawing in
        the muscles; neck drawn back; tension and drawing everywhere. When he comes to rest, the
        limbs want to draw up, hence, hysterical contractures; drawing the fingers all out of shape.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind is slow and the patient is weak and tired; weak memory;

        <p align="JUSTIFY">When an individual does this it is to make the mind comprehend. He must

        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Nervous prostration; waits a moment, looking blank, then, the face lights

        that he was so weak, but put a question to him and he stares at you in perfect amazement,

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Stupor; aroused by every little noise, startles, twitches all over; but
        soon he goes beyond this, becoming less and less excitable, and finally passes into
        unconsciousness and cannot be aroused. You will find some deep-seated brain troubles that
        will try your patience.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">Some cases go slowly and gradually into unconsciousness; rolling of the

        bed; tongue dry and parched, so shriveled that it looks like leather, lips also; lice
        withered and each day looks older; paralysis of one hand or one foot, or it seems that the
        whole muscular system is paralyzed.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">

        A dose of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Zinc</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. will sometimes bring this patient back to life. In a few days
        after the remedy there will be a jerking and quivering in the parts that were motionless, or
        its action will be shown in a copious sweat, much vomiting; sudden arousing that is
        alarming, for it looks like a threatened sinking, but this is the beginning of reaction.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, for days and nights while this little one is coming back to
        consciousness, the restoration of sensation in the parts is accompanied with the most
        tormenting formication, tingling, prickling, creeping, and crawling. The mother and the
        father and the neighbors will want something done for it, but if you antidote, the case will
        return to where it was before. This suffering is but the awakening to life.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">It will go on in this way for a week or two and then will begin to show
        signs of falling back; it needs another dose of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Zinc</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">., which will again
        be followed by a sweat, vomiting, etc. You will see this in spinal meningitis. The early

        <p align="JUSTIFY">You must take the mother aside and inform her what will happen if the
        child returns to consciousness. If you do not, you may be turned out of the house. A person
        advanced in years cannot stand such an ordeal, but it is astonishing how the little ones can
        endure the prolonged congestion and inflammation.</p>
        </font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">After scarlet fever and badly treated meningitis; tubercular meningitis.
        I have carried these severe forms of brain disease through on </font><i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Phosphorus</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">, </font></i><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">which has a picture somewhat like that of </font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#ff0000">Zincum</font><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">. There is no record of any recovery from tubercular meningitis, but a
        homoeopath can cure some of these cases, though it may take two or three months to go down
        and come up out of it, with two or three relapses.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="2" color="#0000ff">
