      are three general characteristics of this remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Anxiety with irritability and inclination to commit suicide, but is afraid
      to die.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sleepy in the evening, hours before bedtime; lies aware for an hour or two,
      at 3 or 4 A. M., then wants to sleep late in morning.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Awakens tired and weak and generally worse, with many complaints.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Stomach: Pressure an <i><font color="#0000ff">hour</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">two</font></i> after eating as from a stone (immediately after, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bi., Nux m</font></i>.).</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Menses: Too early, profuse and lasting too long, with aggravation of all
      other complaints during their continuance.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Nux vomica acts better when gived at night, during repose of mind and body;
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph.</font></i> in the morning.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the symptoms called characteristic, as given by Constantine Hering,
      are these:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"After aromatics in food or as medicine, particularly ginger, pepper,
      etc., and after almost any kind of so-called 'hot' medicines (Goullon)." Also, "will
      also benefit persons who have been drugged by mixtures, bitters, herbs and so-called vegetable
      pills, etc. -(B.)"</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is putting it in too wholesale a fashion. It would be true if said
      that <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> will <i><font color="#0000ff">often</font></i>
      benefit such cases. The fact is that it will benefit those cases in which the use of such
      drugs, aromatics, pills, etc. has brought about a condition that simulates the symptoms
      produced in the provings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, or in cases to
      which it is homoeopathic and no others. Another fact is that things often do produce such a
      condition, and that is one reason why so many physicians are invariably prescribing <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> the first thing, in cases coming from allopathic hands,
      without even examining the case, but it is unscientific. We have a law of cure and there are
      cases in which the <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> condition is <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> present but another more similar remedy must be given. It does
      not alter the case to say, "Well, I did not know what had been given," for <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> will neither antidote the effects of the drug poison nor
      cure the disease condition unless it is homoeopathically indicated, especially given in the
      dynamic form.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here are two more of Hering's card symptoms, in which are given the
      temperaments that are most susceptible to the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux</font></i>:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Oversensitiveness, every harmless word offends, every little noise
      frightens, anxious and beside themselves, they cannot bear the least even suitable medicines -
      (B)." And, "For very particular, careful, zealous persons, inclined to get excited
      and angry, or of a spiteful, malicious disposition."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a graphic picture of what is called the "Nervous
      temperament," and practice corroborates the truth of the value of these temparametic
      indications for this remedy; but there are a number of remedies that have as markedly this so
      called nervous temperament, such as <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla, Ignatia, Staphysagria</font></i>,
      and others.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So no physician would be justified in prescribing <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i> on temperament alone, be the indication ever so clear. The <i><font color="#0000ff">whole case</font></i> must come in. There seems to be another kind of
      condition belonging to this nervous group of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      that has not so much of excitability in it. "Hypochondriasis, with studious men, sitting
      too much at home, with abdominal complaints and costiveness."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now if you take a second look at these cases, you will find that a very
      little irritation will arouse their kind of their hypohondriac gloom and make them angry or
      irritable similar to the first condition, so that on the whole the first proves to be the
      predominant one.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If the gloomy or hypochondriac condition of mind persist, we will more
      likely have to look to such remedies as <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum, Nat. mur.</font></i>,
      etc., to find the true similimum. These nervous symptoms of mind and body are wonderful
      leaders to the selection of the right remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Frequent and ineffectual desire to defecate
      or passing but small quantities of fæces at each attempt</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This symptom is pure gold. There are a few other remedies that have it, but
      none so positively and persistently.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is the guiding symptom in the constipation to which <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is homœopathic, and in my experience will then, and
      then only, cure. Carroll Dunham wrote over twenty-five years ago on this symptom. He said, in
      effect -while <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      are equal remedies for constipation there was never any reason for confounding them, or
      alternating them, as they were so different. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      constipation was caused by irregular peristaltic action of the intestines, hence the frequent
      ineffectual desire; but the <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> constipation was
      caused by lack of secretion in the intestines. There was with <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      absolutely no desire, and the stools were dry and hard as if burnt.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">And the above symptom is found not in constipation alone. It is always
      present in dysentry. The stools, though very frequently consisting of slimy mucus and blood,
      are very small and unsatisfactory. Dr.P.P. Wells pointed out the very reliable additional
      symptom for <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> in dysentry -that the <i><font color="#0000ff">pains were very greatly relieved for a short time after every stool</font></i>.
      This is not so with <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>, but the pain and tenesmus
      continue after the stool, as it is sometimes well expressed as "a never-get-done"
      feeling. But it makes little difference whether the patient is afflicted with constipation,
      dysentry, diarrhoea or other diseases, if we have this frequent ineffectual desire for stool
      present we always think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> first, and give it
      unless other symptoms contra-indicate it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Catamenia a few days before time, and rather
      too copious, or keeping on several days longer with complaints at the onset, which remain
      until after it is over</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is also an oft verified symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>.
      Of course there are many other remedies for too early or too copious menstruation. <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea Ostrearum</font></i> is not at all like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i>. I have found that patients that required <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i>., for this condition could hardly ever take <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      for anything. For instance, if the patients had green, bland, thick discharge and you gave
      them <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> it would often bring down too early and
      profuse menses. In such cases I had to give <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> which
      would act like a charm on the catarrh and not aggravate the menses.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These cases calling for <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>.
      often occur in young girls or women at the climacteric. We often have the characteristic
      rectal troubles also present (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium tig</font></i>.). The pains are
      pressing down and extend to the rectum and sometimes also to the neck of bladder. Inefficient <i><font color="#0000ff">labour pains</font></i>, extending to the rectum, with desire for stool or
      frequent urination, are quickly relieved, and become efficient, after the administration of a
      dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> 200.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If, in addition, your menorrhagic patient is costive, has gastric troubles,
      and especially if generally &lt; in the morning, we have an almost sure remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Feels worse in the morning soon after
      awaking</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lach</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nat.
      mur</font></i>.), <i><font color="#0000ff">also after mental exertion</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nat carb</font></i>., vertigo; <i><font color="#0000ff">Calc. ost., Sil</font></i>.,
      occipital); <i><font color="#0000ff">after eating</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Anac.
      card</font></i>., reverse) <i><font color="#0000ff">and in cold air</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Puls</font></i>., reverse)" If Bœnninghausen had never done anything but
      given us his incomparable chapter on aggravations and ameliorations, this alone would have
      immortalised him.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It seems to me, after profiting them in a practice of over thirty years, it
      is impossible to over estimate them. But some one will say perhaps -there are twenty-eight
      remedies in Allen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Bœnninghausen</font></i>., in large caps, that
      are worse in the morning. That does not seem like coming very close to the choice of the
      remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But when we look at those that are worse in the evening, we find
      thirty-eight remedies, and only eight of them occurring under <i><font color="#0000ff">both</font></i>
      morning and evening, and these eight are worse not <i><font color="#0000ff">generally</font></i>,
      but rather in some <i><font color="#0000ff">especial</font></i> symptoms. For instance, in <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> the loose cough is worse in the morning, the tight dry one in
      the evening.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So you see we are quite on the way to making a choice after all. But now
      take all the aggravations of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> as regards time,
      mind, gastric (symptoms), temperature etc., where can you find the combination so prominently
      under any remedy? Of course those physicians who are not able to appreciate anything but
      pathological symptoms have not much use for these modalities. But one thing is certain, they
      cannot do as good homœopathic work without as with them.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Great heat, whole body burning hot,
      especially face red and hot, yet the patient cannot move or uncover in the least without
      feeling chilly</font></i>." This condition of feverishness is of common occurrence and
      yields to <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> with a promptness that would delight
      the heart of a Lippe. It makes no difference what the name of the fever, whether inflammatory,
      remittent or fever accompanying sore throat, rheumatism, or any other local trouble, if we
      have these indications, we may confidently give this remedy and will not be often disappointed
      with the result. It took me years to learn the value of this symptom, because I was a
      routinist and thought that <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Belladonna</font></i>, or both in
      alteration, must be given in all cases where high fever was present. So I have some sympathy
      for young physicians now, who from false teachings have been led to the same error. But let me
      say here, for the benefit of all such, that there is a much better way: namely -to closely
      individualize, which is not always difficult; give the single remedy in the potentised form,
      giving it time to act, and wait for reaction before repeating.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course low potencies will often cure, and that in spite of alternation,
      over dosing and frequent repetition. But they will often fail, and in the great majority of
      cases will not accomplish anything like the satisfactory results of the true similimum, the
      single remedy and the single dose.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">After eating:</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich., Nux moschata</font></i>) <i><font color="#0000ff">sour taste
      pressure in the stomach an hour or two afterward, with hypochondriacal mood, pyrosis tightness
      about the waist; must loosen clothing (Lachesis, Calcarea, and Lycopodium), confused cannot
      use mind two or three hours after meal, epigastrium bloated, with pressure as from a stone in
      the stomach</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a group of symptoms as given in "Guiding Symptoms." There
      are so many symptoms given under the digestive organs that it shows that <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> has really very wide range of action in gastric
      troubles. And there are no really characteristic and peculiar symptoms to mention, unless it
      be the peculiar aggravation of the stomach symptoms "<i><font color="#0000ff">an hour or
      two after eating</font></i>," instead of immediately after as is the case with <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>.
      The pressure as from a stone occurs also in <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">More stress may be placed upon the cause of the stomach, liver and
      abdominal complaints for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is the remedy.
      For instance, coffee, alcoholic drinks, debauchery, abuse of drugs, business anxiety,
      sedentary habits, broken rest from long night watching (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cocc., Cup.
      met., Nit. ac</font></i>.), too high living etc. So we find that <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i> is adapted to complaints arising from these causes, which is abundantly
      verified in practice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One thing is very apt to be present in these cases: namely -the very
      characteristic rectal symptoms already noticed.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We ought not to leave <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      without speaking of its great efficiency in headaches and backaches.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The headache often occurs in conjunction with gastric, hepatic, abdominal
      and hæmorrhoidal affections. Here also the modalities, more than the character of the pain,
      decide the choice. The aggravations are: from mental exertion, chagrin or anger; in open air
      (opposite <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>), on waking in the morning, after
      eating, from abuse of coffee or spirits, sour stomach, in the sunshine, on stooping, from
      light and noise, when moving or opening the eyes (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>),
      from coughing high living or highly seasoned food, in stormy weather, after drugging, from
      masturbation, from constipation or haemmorhoids.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These headaches may or may not localize in any part of the head.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is just as apt to say in one part of the head as another, and
      will often say, in no particular part, "it feels badly and aches all over."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains in the back are more peculiar. The patient is apt to have
      backache in bed, and must sit up to turn over; as turning or twisting the body, aggravates
      when standing (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>) (worse when sitting, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kobalt, Pulsatilla, Rhus toxicod., Zincum</font></i>) or sitting is especially
      painful. The pain is mostly located in the lumbar region, though it may be in the dorsa, and
      is often in connection (like <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus hipp</font></i>.) with
      hæmmorhoids. <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus </font></i>is especially &lt; from walking or
      stooping. Backache caused by masturbation (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kobalt</font></i>, &lt;
      sitting; <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphysagria</font></i>, lying at night) finds one of its
      best remedies in <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>. We might here launch out into
      a description of the general action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> upon the
      spinal cord, including the motor and sensory centers, etc. but that can all be found in other
      works. So now we will leave <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux,</font></i> except as we refer to it
      in comparison while writing of other remedies. In reviewing of what we have written, we are
      impressed that some may be led to think that we have narrowed down the sphere of this truly
      great remedy too much. Let us say here, that it is not our aim in this work to write
      exhaustively upon any remedy, but to point out a few of the chief virtues and the
      characteristic symptoms, around which all the rest revolve.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To write exhaustively would be to write a complete materia medica.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In actual practice there are two kinds of cases that come to every
      physician. One is the case that may be prescribed for with great certainty of success on the
      symptoms that are styled <i><font color="#0000ff">characteristic</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">peculiar</font></i> (Organon § 153.) The other is where in all the case there
      are no such symptoms appearing; then there is only one way, viz, to hunt for the remedy that,
      in its pathogenesis, contains what is called the "<i><font color="#0000ff">tout ensemble</font></i>"
      of the case. The majority of the cases, however, do have, standing out like beacon lights.
      Some characteristic or key note symptoms which guide to the study of the remedy that has the
      whole case in its pathogenesis.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="PULSATILLA"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mental picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> is
      almost the opposite of that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is called the man's remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      the woman's remedy. This means simply that the complaints of one are found oftener with men,
      while those of the other are found oftener with women.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now to call attention to another of Hering's characteristics, and I know of
      no one who has expressed them better, we have -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Mild, gentle and
      yielding disposition; cries et everything; is sad and desponding; creeps about everything; can

      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> is its chronic). Here we have a description of
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> temperament as near as words can express
      it, and it is a fact that when you find it in a patient, no matter what the pathological
      condition, <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> will almost surely help. There are
      few exceptions. So we learn not to put too much stress on pathological states to the neglect
      of symptomatological conditions.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> is a remedy of wide range of action. Farrington
      mentioned its use in seventy-three different affections, and has not by any means exhausted
      them all; and if you study <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> in Hughes' <i><font color="#0000ff">Pharmacodynamics</font></i> you will notice that, although he recommends it in
      many diseases, he does not, and evidently is not able to, talk as much from a pathological
      standpoint especially from the provings of the drug as he does of many other remedies. It
      seems to me like folly to undertake to pose as either an exclusive pathologist or
      symptomatologist. Both pathology and symptomatology are valuable and inseparable; neither can
      be excluded. Pathology is what the <i><font color="#0000ff">doctor</font></i> can tell
      (sometimes); symptomatology is what the <i><font color="#0000ff">patient</font></i> can tell.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another condition of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      which may be considered Characteristic, and which Hering does not mention in his cards, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">changeableness of symptoms (Ignat., Nux mosch</font></i>.). All that Hering
      said was "<i><font color="#0000ff">wandering pains shift rapidly from one part to
      another, also with swelling and redness of the joints.</font></i>" Now if this occurs in
      rheumatism (<i><font color="#0000ff">Manganum acet., Lac caninum, Kali bichrom., Kalmia lat</font></i>.),
      and especially if in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> temperament we may
      perform a miracle of curing with this remedy. But this shifting or changeableness is not
      confined to the pains, which may be either rheumatic or neuralgic, but is found in the
      disposition. The patient is now irritable, then tearful again, or mild and pleasant; but, even
      with the irritableness, is easily made to cry. The hæmorrhages flow, and stop, and flow
      again; continually changing. The stools in diarrhœa Constantly change in color; they are
      green, yellow, white, watery or slimy; as Guernsey expresses it -"no two stools
      alike." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sanicula</font></i>). This is often found in the
      so-called cholera-infantum or entero-colitis of children in hot weather.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We sometimes have patients come into the office, and find, in trying to
      take their case, no "head to tail" to it. It is mixed. The suffering and pain is now
      here, now there. The symptoms are contradictory, as we term them. This condition should always
      call attention to <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> and it will often clear up
      and cure the case. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> also has these ever-changing,
      hysterical and contradictory symptoms, both pre-eminently woman remedies.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      is a great remedy for disorders. of digestion. Symptoms -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Bad
      taste in the mouth, especially early in the morning, or nothing tastes good, or no taste at
      all</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, bad taste with coated
      tongue and thirst; Pulsat., no thirst).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Great dryness of the mouth in the morning,
      without thirst. Stomach disordered from cakes, pastry, rich food; particularly fat pork</font></i>."
      (I would say -fat meats generally). These are reliable symptoms, as given in Hering's cards,
      and are not very much like the symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>,
      which is not disturbed by fats, but on the contrary likes them and they agree. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> warm food agrees best; with <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>,
      cold things.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The bad taste in the mouth is persistent and the <i><font color="#0000ff">loss</font></i>
      of taste is frequent, as is also the loss of smell. How peculiar that <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      should have dry mouth and no thirst, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>
      should have characteristically moist mouth with intense thirst. There is no accounting for
      taste, as the man said when he saw a fellow kiss his mother-in-law.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I do not know that I could give a satisfactory pathological reason for
      this. Is it not a good thing that we do not have to give the pathological explanation for such
      a symptom before we can use it to cure our patients? To be sure there is always a reason for
      these things, but we do not need to know what it is before we can utilize the symptom.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The merest tyro in prescribing could hardly mistake the symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> for those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      and yet I have found physicians prescribing these remedies in alternation, at intervals of two
      or three hours.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Having called attention to the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      on the digestive organs, which are lined with mucous membranes, we now wish to notice that it
      has a peculiar action on mucous surfaces generally. This peculiarity consists in the character
      of the <i><font color="#0000ff">discharges</font></i> from them. They are <i><font color="#0000ff">thick, bland</font></i> and yellowish green. These are found in nasal catarrh;
      leucorrhœa; expectoration; gonorrhœa; in ulcers; from the ears and eyes; in short, from
      every mucous outlet of the body.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The expectoration of <i><font color="#0000ff">pulsatilla</font></i>, which
      is thick, green and bland, tastes bitter, while that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>
      is sweet and that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroiodicum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> salty. One of Schuessler's tissue remedies (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali sulphuricum</font></i>) greatly resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      in the character of its discharges, and not only that, but also in its wandering pains,
      evening aggravations and ameliorations in cool, open air. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      hydroiodicum</font></i> is also ameliorated in open air and worse in a warm room. Now that we
      are on the subject of greenish discharges, especially the expectoration, we will mention also <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg. Lycopodium, Paris, Phosphorus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. Of course, the other symptoms must decide the choice
      between several remedies having one symptom in common.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A certain physician in Albany, N. Y., was called in consultation on a
      so-called case of phthisis pulmonalis. The case was in allopathic hands. After carefully
      examining the case, he was asked: "What is your diagnosis, doctor?" "<i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>," said the doctor. "What!" "<i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>," replied the doctor. <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>
      was the diagnosis of the remedy, not the disease. It was given and <i><font color="#0000ff">cured
      the patient</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now we come to the curative action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      in affections of the female genital organs. The fact that it has such a decided action upon
      these, added to the womanish disposition of this remedy, is additional reason why it is called
      the woman's remedy, as we said when writing upon the disposition and temperament. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Catamenia too late and scanty, or suppressed, particularly by getting feet wet</font></i>,"
      and "Painful menstruation with great restlessness, tossing in every possible
      direction," and we have already mentioned the changeable characteristics in the flow of
      the menses, viz., they stop, and flow, stop and flow again, etc. So, also, the menorrhagia.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In these menstrual troubles of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      the wetting or chilling of the feet is of prime importance and, acting upon it, you may save
      your patient from consumption as a result of such exposure and suppression. Now don't pour
      down mother tincture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> by the ten-drop doses,
      as is the manner of those who do not believe in potentized remedies. You may give <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> in the high, higher, and highest potencies, and
      confidently expect the best results. I have often seen the delayed menses of young girls of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> temperament appear promptly and naturally under the M.
      M. of Swan and C. M. of Fincke (also with <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carbonicum,
      Tuberculinum</font></i>, and others). so also have I seen them restored after suppression, by
      the same. Now if you should try one of these very high potencies in a case of menstrual
      difficulty, and it should not succeed, don't jump to the conclusion that I have been mistaken,
      for <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> is not the only remedy for such cases.
      Homœopathy is too often blamed when the blame lies in the stupidity and malpractice of the
      prescriber. <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>. will relieve more cases of
      painful menstruation than <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, and that is not a
      cure-all, either. <i><font color="#0000ff">Study up your case</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But after all, the prime characteristic of this wonderful remedy lies in
      its modality. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Better in cold air and from cold applications</font></i>."
      The patient is not only better generally in the open, cool air and worse in a warm, closed
      room, but local affections also, as, for instance, the vertigo; pain in head, eyes, ears;
      itching of eyelids; roaring; coryza; pain in face; toothache; colic; labor pains; sciatica;
      ulcers, are all better in open air. These affections that are &gt; in cold air are also
      especially &gt; while walking or moving slowly about (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum</font></i>)
      in open or cool air. Remember that <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> as well as <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i> is ameliorated by motion, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> in cold or cool open air, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus
      tox</font></i>. wants motion in warm dry air.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">With Pulsatilla warm applications aggravate, warm room oppresses, heat of
      bed aggravates itching (<i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>) and chilblains; cold
      drinks retained, warm vomited.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Other remedies have aggravations from heat; but <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      leads them all. The relief from cold and cool, open air is as positive as that of warmth or
      heat is for <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now to close our remarks on <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      we will give a few choice symptoms without any particular comments upon them.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Affections consequent on the abuse of Iron." "Chronic
      affections following cases of badly managed measles." "Pressure, or tying up
      tightly, relieves the headaches." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nit., Apis mellifica</font></i>).
      "Increased inclination to micturate, &lt; <i><font color="#0000ff">when lying</font></i>."
      "Metastasis of gonorrhœa to testicles." "Chilliness, with pains, yet wants
      cool room." "One-sided sweats." "Inflamed parts bluish," (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis, Tarantula Cub</font></i>.) "Pulsations through the whole
      body." "Metastasis of mumps to mammæ or testicles." In any of these local
      affections we should expect to find the mind and modality of this remedy present or not be
      very confident of a brillant cure.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As in <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, so in <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, the leading characteristic lies in its
      "modality." Three words express it -<i><font color="#0000ff">aggravation from motion</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">What is aggravated on motion? Sufferings of almost any and every kind. We
      will not undertake to enumerate them. All that Hering says in his cards on that line is
      -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Joints red, swelling, stiff with stitching win from slightest
      motion</font></i>," and this so far as it goes is genuine, but it is only the beginning
      of all the ailments that are &lt; on motion.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Look in "Guiding Symptoms," under "Motion," and see the
      long list of symptoms aggravated by motion, and even these do not cover all. Now we begin to
      realize the value of this modality.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It makes no difference what the name of the disease, if the patient feels
      greatly &gt; by lying still and suffers greatly on the slightest motion, and the more and
      longer he moves the more he suffers, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> is the first
      remedy to be thought of, and there must be very strong counter-indications along other lines
      that will rule it out.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Nor does it make much difference what organ or tissue is the seat of the
      disease, mucous, serous or muscular, the same rule applies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another very valuable modality of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      is again expressed in three words -<i><font color="#0000ff">amelioration from pressure</font></i>.
      This is the reason the patient, much to the astonishment of the nurse, wants to <i><font color="#0000ff">lie on the paintful side</font></i> or part. (Opposite <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna, Kali carbonicum</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No one can realize the value of these two modalities until he has often met
      them at the sick bed and witnessed the prompt relief from the use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">When writing upon <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, we
      noticed the characteristic action of that remedy upon the mucous surfaces. Here <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> acts just as characteristically, but it is so different.
      With <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> it is <i><font color="#0000ff">excessive
      dryness</font></i> or lack of secretion in them. It begins in the lips, which are <i><font color="#0000ff">parched, dry and cracked</font></i>, and only ends with the rectum and stools,
      which are <i><font color="#0000ff">hard and dry as if burnt</font></i>. The same condition is
      undoubtedly present in the stomach. which is evidenced by the excessive thirst; which can only
      be satisfied by <i><font color="#0000ff">large draughts of water</font></i>; a little does not
      satisfy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The same condition obtains in the lungs and bronchia, which causes <i><font color="#0000ff">hard, dry cough</font></i> with little or no expectoration, and with <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness and pain in the chest</font></i> when the patient coughs. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulphuricum</font></i> has loose cough with <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness</font></i>).
      The urine is scanty and only exceptionally (or as I would express it reactionally) copious. We
      must remember that every remedy has a dual action. These two actions are termed primary and
      secondary. I think that the so-called secondary action is only the reaction of the organism
      against the first or primary (so-called) action of the drug. For instance -the real action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> is to produce sleep or stupor, the reaction is wakefulness;
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum, Aloes</font></i>, etc., catharsis; the reaction
      constipation, and I think that the truly homœopathic curative must be in accord with the
      primary (so-called) effects of every drug in order to get the best and most radical cure, but
      if given for the secondary (so-called) symptoms, the primary ones having passed by, we should
      carefully inquire for all the symptoms which have preceded those which are present; and taking
      both past and present, let them all enter into the picture whose counterpart is to be found in
      the drug which is to cure. Any other method is only palliative and not curative.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> has also a very decided effect upon the <i><font color="#0000ff">serous membranes</font></i>. It is very useful in the second stage of
      inflammation, after the stage of serous effusion has set in. In most of these cases the first
      stage has been attended by symptoms calling for the exhibition of such remedies as <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Belladonna, Ferrum phos</font></i>., etc., but not always; and right
      here let me call attention to the most characteristic pains of this remedy. They are <i><font color="#0000ff">stitching pains</font></i>. Now observe, the characteristic pains of
      inflammatory affections of the serous membranes are <i><font color="#0000ff">stitching pains</font></i>;
      this is the reason why <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> comes to be such a regal
      remedy in pleuritis, meningitis, peritonitis, pericarditis, etc. The subjective symptoms
      corresponding to the remedy must go down before it, and the objectives must as surely follow.
      Only one remedy can equal <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> for stitching pains,
      viz, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carbonicum</font></i>. (Stitching pains in chest are
      particularly found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia, Kali carb., Natrum mar., Squilla</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercur. viv</font></i>.). And there is this difference between
      them: The <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> stitches come on or are aggravated by
      the least motion, while those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carbonicum</font></i> will
      occur whether the patient moves or not, (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> &gt; by
      pressure, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>., not). But in both remedies they cry
      out sharply with the pains. <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> has pains which cause the
      patient to cry out sharply, but they are stinging pains -<i><font color="#0000ff">like a bee
      sting</font></i>. All these three are great remedies for effusions into serous cavities, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> precedes and follows equally well anyone of them.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A word right here in regard to interpolating <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>,
      when, as we express it, "the seemingly indicated remedy does not act." Some would
      stumble over that, and ask -as they would have a right to do- how about your similia, etc., in
      such a use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>? I answer -<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      is a remedy of wide range of action, and covers more perfectly those conditions and symptoms
      which are the outgrowth of psora than any other remedy; so it does meet the case complicated
      by psora very often, and either cures it or removes the complication so that the other
      remedies may act. But remember it will not always do it, and other antipsoric remedies must be
      chosen. It must be the simillimum for the psoric condition.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> stands alongside of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> for disorders of alimentation. All three
      remedies have a sensation as of a stone in the stomach, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> more so than <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> leads in thirst, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i> less, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> little or none. All
      have bad taste in the mouth; <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> bitter and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      sour. All have nausea and vomiting; <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> worse on
      motion, as rising up, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> in the A. M. and after
      eating, <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> in the evening and also after eating.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The gastric derangements of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      often occur as a result of dietetic errors, especially when warm weather sets in after cold.
      Those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> more from continued over-eating and
      inactivity, the abuse of drugs, coffee, tobacco or alcoholics; <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      from too rich foods, pastries, fat foods and ice cream (in excess); a little ice cream feels
      good in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> stomach, but much overdose the
      matter, because it is <i><font color="#0000ff">too rich</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All three remedies have attacks of diarrhœa, although constipation is most
      characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i>, and is only exceptionally found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Bryonia diarrhœa is worse in the morning, on movement, and open occurs as
      an effect of over-eating in the heat of summer. <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      diarrhœa is also apt to be worse in the morning, is mostly caused by over-eating and is apt
      to put on the dysenteric type. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> diarrhœa is
      more apt to occur in the night, from causes above mentioned, and is attended with great
      rumbling of the bowels.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All have white, sometimes very thickly-coated tongue, but taking into
      account the <i><font color="#0000ff">causes</font></i> of these gastric and bowel troubles,
      temperament and modalities there should not be much difficulty in choosing the right remedy
      for any case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So far as temperament is concerned, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      has much more of the "rheumatic diathesis." Both are easily irritated or angered,
      and are oftenest found indicated in spare, dark-complexioned subjects. Both are aggravated
      generally on motion, by <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> very much the more so,
      while <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> is sometimes like <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i> relieved by motion.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now a few special indications for <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      and we will have it:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Bursting headache, as if it would split the head open, aggravated by
      stooping; coughing; ironing; opening or moving the eyes; moving any way; in hot weather.
      Nausea and faintness when rising up, relieved when lying still."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Epistaxis instead of menses (vicarious menstruation), also blood
      spitting."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Mastitis; breasts pale, hot, hard, heavy and painful."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Suppression of lochia with bursting headache."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Suppression of milk, menses, measles or rash of scarlatina, or where
      all these are slow in appearing; of course the other Bryonia symptoms must be present."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Frequent desire to take long breath; must expand the lungs. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus, Ignatia, Nat sulph</font></i>.)."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Cough dry, &lt; <i><font color="#0000ff">after eating, sometimes math
      vomiting</font></i>; &lt; moving; &lt; <i><font color="#0000ff">coming from open air into warm
      room</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nat. carb</font></i>)."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Cough hurts head and chest, holds them with hands." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium perf., Natrum sulph</font></i>.).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These are some of the peculiar symptoms which cannot be ranged under any
      general head, and are excellent leaders to the consideration of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>,
      all and each of which will be found associated with the more general characteristics already
      noticed.</p>
      <p align="justify">The dominant school do not know what they have lost in not being acquainted
      with the virtues of this remedy, as developed in our provings and clinical use, but we know
      what we have gained.</p>
