      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy, like the three of which we have been writing, has a strong
      affinity for the alimentary canal. Its leading characteristic is in its <i><font color="#0000ff">thickly-coated, white, very white, white as milk, tongue</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Many remedies have white tongue, but this one leads them all. It is also a
      great stomach remedy, and in disorders of this organ arising from over-eating, where there is
      much nausea, distress, and especially the characteristic tongue, it is to be thought of before
      any of the three of which we have written. It is especially to be considered if the gastric
      derangement is of recent date. The process of digestion is hardly under way; the eructations
      taste of the food as he ate it, and the sufferer feels as if he must "throw up"
      before there will be any relief. In such a case a few pellets of <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium
      crudum</font></i> on the tongue will often settle the business, save the loss of a meal, and
      all further suffering.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Diarrh라 may often follow these dietetic errors, especially during the
      heat of the summer season, and then the stools are peculiar in that they are partly solid and
      partly fluid, showing that digestion has been only partially performed in the whole length of
      the canal <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      sometimes present about equal claims in a case of summer complaint; but the case in its
      entirety must decide the choice between them.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a form of diarrh라 which alternates with constipation, oftenest
      found with old people, where <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i> is the only
      remedy. Then it is also one of the best remedies for mucous piles; there is a <i><font color="#0000ff">continuous oozing</font></i> of mucus staining the linen, very disagreeable to
      the patient.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are some mind symptoms that are very peculiar, "the greatest
      sadness and woeful mood with intermittent fever"; again, "sentimental mood in
      moonlight, ecstatic love," and again, "<i><font color="#0000ff">child cannot bear to
      he touched or looked at</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Of the first two symptoms I can say nothing from experience or observation,
      but of the last, that it is a gem. Many times in cases of gastric or remittent fever, for
      which <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i> is a very excellent remedy, I have
      been led to its use by this very condition of the mind: the child is cross, but not like <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> wants to be carried and soothed, but will scream and
      cry, and show temper at every little attention. Another thing that I have noticed in many of
      these cases is, that the fever runs higher at night and is accompanied with great thirst; the
      white tongue is almost always present. Such children are quite apt, even when around the
      house, to have "<i><font color="#0000ff">sore, cracked and crusty nostrils, and corners
      of the mouth</font></i>," and so this may appear when sick.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a peculiar constitutional condition found in some people which
      calls for this remedy. It is found in the extremities ; <i><font color="#0000ff">finger-nails
      grow in splits</font></i>, like warts, with horny spots (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>
      nails crippled, on fingers and toes; <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> nails
      become <i><font color="#0000ff">thick</font></i>, crippled; <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>
      nails brittle, crumbling, distorted), and if by accident one becomes injured or split, it does
      not repair as it should, but grows out of shape. Then the toe-nails are brittle and grow out
      of shape also, or shrivel up and do not grow at all. The feet are covered on the soles <i><font color="#0000ff">with corns and callosities which are</font></i> VERY TENDER, can hardly walk
      on them on account of this tenderness.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Some of the worst cases of chronic rheumatism have been cured by this
      remedy, guided by the excessive tenderness of the soles of the feet. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i>
      soles get sore from foot sweat; <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> soles pain and
      are tender; <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> heels and soles tender when walking; <i><font color="#0000ff">Medorrhinum</font></i> couldn't walk except on knees; <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopod</font></i>.
      soles swollen and painful). Horny excrescences anywhere on the skin make one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i>. The remedy is oftenest found indicated in the
      extremes of life, in children and old people.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now the peculiar modalities which deserve particular mention are: First,
      the troubles are often caused or aggravated by heat, and especially by the <i><font color="#0000ff">heat of the sun</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia, Glonoine,
      Gelsem., Nat. carb</font></i>). The patient feels exhausted during warm weather; the gastric
      troubles come on, or are worse; such as nausea, vomiting and diarrh라. The cough is worse,
      and, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, is worse on coming into a warm room
      from cold air. These affections are particularly worse in sunshine, but also from radiate heat
      of the fire, so that <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i> takes a high rank
      as a not weather remedy. Second, <i><font color="#0000ff">cold bathing aggravates or causes
      trouble</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox., Sulphur</font></i>) "Child cries
      when washed or bathed in cold water." Cold bathing causes headache, cold in the head,
      gastric catarrh, diarrh라, suppressed menses, toothache, etc. When any case of long standing
      comes to us, and the patient dates the beginning of the trouble to going in swimming or
      falling into the water, we think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i> and
      examine for further indications for the drug.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now a few scattering symptoms that have found their remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i>: "Copious h鹵orrhage from the bowels, mixed
      with solid f爐es; chronic redness of the eyelids; toothache in <i><font color="#0000ff">decayed
      teeth</font></i>, worse at night; gastric trouble after acids, sour wine, vinegar," etc.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As in <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i>, so in <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>, the leading characteristic is found in the mouth, or, I
      might rather say, characteristics, for the <i><font color="#0000ff">gums are swollen, spongy,
      sometimes bleeding</font></i>; the tongue is also <i><font color="#0000ff">swollen, flabby,
      taking the imprint of the teeth</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum, Chelidonium,
      Podophyllum, Rhus tox</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>),
      generally moist, yet with intense thirst; the whole mouth is moist with salivation which is
      soapy or stringy, and the odor from the mouth is <i><font color="#0000ff">very offensive</font></i>;
      you can smell it all over the room. No remedy has this condition of mouth in any degree equal
      to <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>. It is found in very many complaints, and if
      anything corroborative of the truth of "similia," etc., were desired the curative
      power of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury,</font></i> when indicated by these symptoms, ought
      to be satisfactory. Many a time have I given great relief to my patient, and great credit to
      Hom랊pathy, by brilliant cures of that painful affection, quinsy, guided by these symptoms.
      Of course, in addition to the above symptoms the tonsils were greatly swollen and often
      apparently on the verge of suppuration. Right here let me warn against giving <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius too low</font></i>, for if you do, it will hasten suppuration
      instead of aborting it. If anyone is skeptical as to the efficiency of the very high
      potencies, I invite him to a test in just such a case. Give a single dose, dry upon the
      tongue, or if you must seem to do more, dissolve a powder in four tablespoonfuls of water and
      give in half-hourly doses. Then <i><font color="#0000ff">Wait</font></i>. I have done in many
      times and am convinced. If the patient has that other strong characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">profuse perspiration,
      without relief of the suffering</font></i>, success is doubly sure. (Sweat relieves, <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum, Natrum mur., Psorinum</font></i>.) I wish right here, as perhaps
      the most appropriate place, to disclaim being an exclusive high-potentist. The questions of
      dose is, and I believe must remain, an open one as long as different degrees of susceptibility
      are found in different diseases and persons. I have experimented along the whole line and know
      that both the high and the low are efficacious in certain cases. The preponderance of
      evidence, however, is greatly in favour of the high and the highest. This is my opinion. You
      may differ, and are welcome to do so.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The fever symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> are
      notable, especially in the sweats. The chill also is peculiar as I have observed it. It is not
      a shaking chill, but is simply <i><font color="#0000ff">creeping chilliness</font></i>. Often
      when this creeping chilliness is felt it is the first symptom of a cold that has been taken,
      and, if left alone, the coryza, sore throat, bronchitis of even pneumonia may follow; but, if
      taken early, a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> may prevent all such
      troubles. The chilliness is felt most generally in the evening and increases into the night if
      not removed by <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>. It also alternates with flashes of
      heat; first chilly, then hot, then chilly, etc., like <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>.
      It is often felt in single parts. Then again it is felt in abscesses and is the harbinger of
      pus formation. If pus has already formed, especially much of it, the only thing <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> can do is to hasten its discharge; but if little or none is
      actually formed a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> high will often check
      the formation and a profuse sweat often follows with a subsidence of the swelling and a rapid
      cure of the disease.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now the sweats. They are very profuse and do not relieve like the sweats of
      inflammatory diseases generally do, but no the contrary the complaints <i><font color="#0000ff">increase with the sweat</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Tilia.</font></i>).
      In what diseases is this condition found? It may be found in almost every disease: In sore
      throat, bronchitis, pneumonia, pleuritis, peritonitis, abscesses, rheumatism, etc., to the end
      of a long list. In short in any disease in which this profuse and persistent sweating without
      relief is present <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> is the first remedy to be
      thought of. <i><font color="#0000ff">Worse at night</font></i>, and especially in the <i><font color="#0000ff">warmth</font></i> <i><font color="#0000ff">of </font></i>the bed, is another
      strong characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum pal</font></i>.) There is a long list of remedies that have aggravations
      at night, but not so many from warmth of the bed. I have cured many skin diseases of various
      names guided by this modality.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The glands and bones also come strongly under the influence of this remedy.
      The glandular swellings are cold, inclined to suppurate, having these chilly creepings
      aforementioned. These with the bone-pains in the exostoses and caries are all <i><font color="#0000ff">aggravated</font></i> at night in the warmth of the bed.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mucous membranes are everywhere affected; the discharges from them are
      at first thin and excoriating, even from the catarrh of the nose to the diarrh랄c, or
      dysenteric, discharges. Afterwards they become thicker or more bland, like the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> discharges. Where are worse at night also, even the
      leucorrh라.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Hahnemann ranked <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> (first) for
      syphilis, as he did <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> for psora and <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> for sycosis, and no doubt justly so, for <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> in its various forms symptomologically covers more cases of
      that disease than any other remedy. but it must be remembered that <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>
      is no more a panacea for syphilis than is <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> for
      psora or <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> for sycosis, else there would be no truth
      in similia similibus. The case in hand must simulate <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>,
      or that remedy is not "in it," but some other remedy is. Experience abundantly
      corroborates this and proves the truth of the law, <i><font color="#0000ff">Similia Similibus
      Curantur</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">While we are on the subject of mercury we may as well notice the various
      combinations of the drug. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius solubilis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">vivus</font></i> are so nearly alike that with the same indications some use
      one and some the other preparation. It is claimed by some that the <i><font color="#0000ff">vivus</font></i>
      is better adapted to men and <i><font color="#0000ff">solubilis</font></i> to women. I have
      not observed it, but do think that the <i><font color="#0000ff">solubilis</font></i> works
      better in skin troubles. Of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius corrosivus</font></i> we have
      to say that it leads all other remedies for <i><font color="#0000ff">tenesmus of the rectum</font></i>.
      This tenesmus is incessant. Stool does not relieve it, and this is what decides between it and
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> in dysentery. It has also severe tenesmus of
      the bladder, and may here vie with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis, Capsicum</font></i> and
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, especially in dysentery.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Other symptoms must decide the choice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This severe tenesmus may begin in the rectum and extend to the bladder or
      vice versa.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a very efficient remedy in gonorrh라, in the second stage, when the
      greenish discharge has set in and the burning and tenesmus <i><font color="#0000ff">continues</font></i>.
      It seems to have gained some reputation in Bright's disease. I have no experience with it
      here, but would expect it to do good <i><font color="#0000ff">if it were indicated</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It seems, according to the testimony of others, to be a useful remedy for
      catarrhal affections of the eyes and nose. Here also I have no testimony to offer, but would
      not cast doubt upon it for that reason. I do not desire to place my own experience ahead of
      that of others. We are co-laborers. Let each add to the general store of medical knowledge,
      that all may draw freely from it as occasion demands.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">MERCURIUS CYANATUS.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Beck, of Monthey, in Switzerland (I think it was), first brought this
      remedy to notice as of great value in that much-dreaded disease, diphtheria. Von Villiers
      claimed to have had astonishing success with it in Germany, losing only two per cent. (if I
      remember correctly) of the cases treated With it. He recommended the 30th potency, but others
      have used the 6th and claim equally good results. There are, so far as I can find, no very
      marked characteristic symptoms by which to choose it. It seems to spread its action all over
      the buccal cavity. Dr. T. F. Allen published a good cure with it, and then claimed that he
      chose this preparation of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> on account <i><font color="#0000ff">of the remarkable prostration</font></i>, which he attributed to the cyanogen
      element in it. This looks reasonable. But I think we must investigate further to bring out its
      true characteristics. There is a chronic condition of the throat in which I have found it very
      efficacious. It is in the so-called cases of public speakers. The throat feels raw and sore,
      and examination reveals a broken down appearance of the mucous membrane bordering on
      ulceration. It is nor granulated, but looks raw in spots, as if denuded of membrane. I have
      helped this kind of throat, so that the patient wanted me to remember what it was I gave him
      so that I could repeat the prescription if the trouble returned. I forgot to state that it
      hurt the patient to speak, and there was also hoarseness. This is all I know of this remedy,
      but I believe it well worth proving and study.</p>

      The tip and edges may be red or pale and take the imprint of the teeth, like the other <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercuries</font></i>. Of course, other remedies have a yellow-coated base of

      regard to dose, I have seen good results from the 3d trituration to the C. M. potency. For
      myself I prefer the high, and have had abundant opportunity to test all the different
      potencies. If you are so prejudiced that you cannot give anything above the 12th because you
      cannot discover the drug with the microscope, don't give it too long; withdraw it after a few
      doses and give the powers of reaction a chance.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But diphtheria is not the only disease in which the yellow base of the
      tongue is an indication for the use of this remedy. Stomach and liver troubles often produce
      this appearance of the tongue. It is also a good remedy for Hunterian chancre, and no
      secondary symptoms follow its proper use. Here it must be given high.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">General shaking chill over whole body.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sweat, with great thirst; sweating during sleep, on being covered: This
      remedy is used by both schools of medicine for conditions of great weakness and debility. The
      old school, as they always do, prescribe it for all cases of debility, on general principles,
      under the name of tonic. It remained for Hom랊pathy to indicate its exact place here.
      Hahnemann expresses it: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Debility and other complaints after
      loss of blood or other fluids, particularly by nursing or salivation, bleeding, cupping, etc.,
      or whites, seminal emissions, etc</font></i>." I would add profuse suppuration and long
      continued diarrhea. If the depletion has been sudden, as from a h鹵orrhage from the womb,
      lungs, bowels or nose, there will be <i><font color="#0000ff">faintness, loss of sight,
      ringing in the ears</font></i>, etc. For this state of things we have a "friend
      indeed" in <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>, and it should be given in
      frequently repeated doses, not too low, until reaction is established; then at longer
      intervals, as occasion demands. If the debility is the effect of a slow and long-continued
      drain the symptoms that might indicate it must be sought in the Materia Medica; our space
      forbids trying to note them here, but prominent among them are <i><font color="#0000ff">pale,
      sallow face, sunken eyes with dark rings around, throbbing headaches, night sweats, and sweats
      easily on least motion or labour</font></i>. It is always well when a patient comes to us in a
      very debilitated condition to think of <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>, and to make
      careful inquiry for some debilitating waste that would account for it; for if it is a woman
      she may be suffering from a very profuse leucorrh라, which from delicacy she will not
      mention, or if a young or even married man, he may be suffering from seminal losses, of which
      he would not speak if not encouraged to do so.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again this remedy has its sphere of usefulness in disorders of the
      alimentary canal. It has loss of appetite, but <i><font color="#0000ff">canine hunger</font></i>
      is more characteristic. It is a great flatulent remedy, the choice often remaining between it,
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.
      H. N. Guernsey expresses it about right in these words -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Uncomfortable
      distention of the abdomen, with a wish to belch up, or a sensation as if the abdomen were
      packed full, not in the least relieved by eructation</font></i>." Such patients are
      troubled with slow digestion, and as they express it: sometimes it seems as if the food all
      turned to gas. They feel so full and oppressed they can hardly breathe and still will feel
      hungry at meal-time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">That the process of digestion is seriously impaired is shown by a tendency
      to diarrh라, especially from eating fruit. The stools are watery, yellow, brownish, or light
      colored and <i><font color="#0000ff">undigested</font></i>, and what is not generally found
      under other remedies they are <i><font color="#0000ff">painless</font></i>. The stools are
      also accompanied with large discharge of <i><font color="#0000ff">flatulence</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phos</font></i>.). This is in accord with the windy condition of the
      bowels generally. This condition of abdomen with attending diarrh라 is often found in
      children, and the child is weak, pale, with dark rings around the eyes. Here <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> is the remedy, not <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i>
      on the theory of "worrums," and it is astonishing what improvement follows in a
      short time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now as to this remedy as an anti-periodic. The popular use of it by the old
      school, and the laity under their instruction in this sense, or as a panacea for all so-called
      malarious diseases, is a curse to the race. That it is a great remedy, when indicated by the
      symptoms, for periodical affections, whether of malarial origin or not, is true, and so it is
      true of <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium Perfoliatum, Ipecacuanha, Natrum muriaticum,
      Arsenicum album</font></i>, and a host of other remedies. Affections that do not come strictly
      under the head of malarial, if they are <i><font color="#0000ff">worse every other day</font></i>,
      should call attention to <i><font color="#0000ff">Cinchona</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I remember a bad case of inflammatory rheumatism, which had been treated by
      an eclectic physician with local applications until the disease had been driven to the heart,
      which I quickly relieved by <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>, being led to its choice
      by this every-other-day aggravation of the symptoms. Of course, there were other indications
      for the remedy, but this was the key that helped to unlock the case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Those who depend on China or its alkaloid as a general cure-all for
      intermittents will meet with disappointments all along the way, for while it may have the
      power to suppress the paroxysms in many cases it has the power to suppress the paroxysms in
      many cases it has the power tocure in comparatively few. I have seen a case suppressed time
      and again with it, return as often, for over a year and a half that I cured with a single
      prescription of <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium perfoliatum</font></i>. And so with <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum muriaticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum album</font></i>.
      With all its vaunted power over malarial affections, especially intermittent fever, the
      indications for its use are not so clear cut as for many other remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once had three cases of intermittent fever in one family, living in the
      same house and exposed to the same influences. Quinine failed to cure any one of them, and a
      different remedy, as indicated by the symptoms according to the hom랊pathic law of cure, was
      required for each case and promptly cured it. The respective remedies were <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium perfoliatum, Ignatia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Capsicum</font></i>.
      Now any good hom랊path can tell you the leading symptoms for all three remedies.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      <p align="JUSTIFY">That is science.</p>
      </font></i>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once knew a druggist who told me that he had at last discovered one thing
      that mothers-in- law were good for. Of course I asked him what it was. I wanted to <i><font color="#0000ff">know.</font></i> He answered, to try patent medicines on. she died (the
      mother-in-law) shortly after. Well, there is one thing that quinine in the hands of the
      average old school physician is good for, and that is to make patients for hom랊paths, for we
      find more patients to treat coming from its abuse than we find calling for its use as a
      curative, and from a purely business standpoint we are greatly indebted to them (the
      allopathic) for a good bit of practice. But how in the name of gratitude; we can ever pay them
      out of the poisonous results of our little pill practice I don't know.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now what are the best remedies for what is called the <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i> cachexia? Here, as ever, we must answer, the <i><font color="#0000ff">indicated</font></i> one. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac., Arsenicum, Natrum
      mur., Pulsatilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum</font></i> are often
      indicated, but they do not cover all cases any more than do <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar
      Sulph., Nitric acid</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroiodicum</font></i>, all
      cases of chronic mercurial poisoning. It is nonsense -worse than nonsense- it is old-schoolism
      to say I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> because the patient had taken
      pepper tea, or <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> for <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>,
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali. hydroiod</font></i>. for <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>.
      We do not prescribe <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> because the patient has fever
      (the old school does), but because the patient has with the fever other symptoms which enable
      us to choose between <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> and many other remedies that
      have fever also, and this to the exclusion of all the rest. <i><font color="#0000ff">This is
      science again</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> is one of the best remedies in chronic liver troubles.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is pain in the right hypochondria, and often the liver may be felt
      below the ribs, enlarged, hard and sensitive to touch. The skin and sclerotica are yellow, the
      urine dark colored and stools light, lacking the color due to a proper secretion of bile. Now
      if in addition to all this we have in part or whole the abdominal symptoms so characteristic
      of this remedy <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>; will do excellent service. It is
      equally good in splenic diseases which closely resemble the splenic troubles resulting from
      the abuse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>. I have found the 200th do better
      than lower potencies in these troubles.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I wish to say in addition to what has already been said of <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> for h鹵orrhages, that the bleeding may come from any or
      every outlet or orifice of the body. <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg., Ferrum, Crotalus
      horridus, Phosphorus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i> also
      claim attention here.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> has excessive sensitiveness of the nervous system. The
      special senses seem too acute; the mind is unpleasantly affected, and nothing as more
      characteristic of this remedy than its extreme <i><font color="#0000ff">sensitiveness to touch</font></i>.
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Asaf랎ida, Hepar</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>).
      It affects the skin all over the body, even the hair feels sore (so says the patient) because
      moving the hair hurts the sensitive scalp, and in addition to this, one peculiar thing is that
      while the <i><font color="#0000ff">lightest touch will increase to an extreme degree the pains
      of the diseased part, hard pressure relieves</font></i>. That seems impossible, but is true
      nevertheless. The sensitiveness is so extreme that a current of air blowing on the part will
      cause great pain and suffering.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Plumbum</font></i> also has this excessive hyper鹿thesia, and I once cured
      a very obstinate case of post-diphtheritic paralysis, being led to its administration by this
      symptom. <i><font color="#0000ff">Capsicum</font></i> also has it. The patient can hardly bear
      to be shaved on account of it.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In our remarks upon <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> we said that
      for flatulent conditions the choice lay often between it, <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i>
      also ranges alongside <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> for debilitated states. The
      weakness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i> is not surpassed by any
      other remedy. This, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Muriatic acid</font></i> form a trio of remedies which according to well-known
      indications has snatched many a patient from the very jaws of death. Picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>.: <i><font color="#0000ff">Vital forces nearly exhausted,
      cold surface, especially from knees down to feet; lies motionless, as if dead; breath cold;
      pulse intermittent, thready; cold sweat on limbs</font></i>. This is truly a desperate
      condition. Then add to these symptoms, <i><font color="#0000ff">blood stagnates in the
      capillaries, causing blueness, coldness and ecchymoses</font></i>; the patient so weak he
      cannot breathe without being constantly fanned. Gasps: "Fan me ! Fan me !" <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>. has saved such cases. This is a picture of a case of
      typhoid fever, and in one case we saw added still to this, h鹵orrhage of dark, decomposed,
      unclotted blood; could not clot on account of its broken down condition; blood oozing from
      gums and nostrils, and an indescribable <i><font color="#0000ff">paleness</font></i> not only
      of the hippocratic face, but also of the skin of the whole body, yet <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo
      veg</font></i>. restored to health, and in an aged woman at that. I have here, as faithfully
      as I can, portrayed the wonderful power of this remedy in such a desperate case. Of course no
      remedy can raise the dead, no matter how strong the indications before death; but no remedy
      can come nearer than this and the dominant school know little or nothing about it, and never
      can until they will consent to use it in the hom랊pathic form and according to hom랊pathic
      indications.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The sphere of this remedy is not by any means limited to low or weakening
      states in connection with acute diseases. To give an idea of its use when indicated by the
      symptoms in chronic ailments, I can do no better than quote from Henry N. Guernsey: "No
      truer remark was ever written than that <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i>
      is especially adapted to cachectic individuals whose vital powers have become weakened. This
      remark is made particularly clear when considered in the light of those cases in which disease
      seems to be engrafted upon the system by reason of the depressing influence of some prior
      derangement. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>). Thus, for instance, the patient
      tells us that asthma has troubled him ever since he had the whooping cough in childhood; he
      has dyspepsia ever since a drunken debauch which occurred some years ago; he has never been
      well since the time he strained himself so badly (<i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox., Calcarea
      ost</font></i>.); the strain itself does not now seem to be the matter, but his present
      ailments have all appeared since it happened; he sustained an injury some years ago, no traces
      of which are now apparent, and yet he dates his present complaints from the time of the
      occurrence of that accident; or again, he was injured by exposure to damp, hot air and his
      present ailments result from it. It will be well for the physician to think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i> in similar cases which are numerous and may
      present very dissimilar phenomena, as these circumstances being suggestive of <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>. it in all probability will be found to be the
      appropriate remedy which the agreement of the other symptoms of the case with those of the
      drug will serve to corroborate." This is from the pen of one of the best prescribers that
      ever lived, and I feel justified in quoting it entire.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy seems to affect deeply the whole alimentary tract, and the same
      broken down, weakened condition appears. The <i><font color="#0000ff">gums break down, become
      spongy, bleed on touching or sucking them or become retracted from the teeth, lower incisors</font></i>
      and are painfully sensitive or sore on chewing or even pressing the teeth hard together. The
      stomach also becomes weak. acidity and pyrosis is frequent; the plainest food disagrees, fat
      foods especially. Here <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i> succeeds when <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> fails.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The most marked and valuable place for this remedy is in its power to
      relieve complaints from <i><font color="#0000ff">excessive flatulence in the stomach</font></i>.
      "Great accumulations of flatulence in the stomach." "Stomach feels full and
      tense from flatulence." Great pain in stomach on account of flatulence, worse especially
      on <i><font color="#0000ff">lying down</font></i>, should always call attention to this
      remedy. All this may occur in different affections ranging from a simple dyspepsia to
      incurable cancer of the stomach. In the latter case, and even in cases not so serious, we may
      have added <i><font color="#0000ff">burning in stomach</font></i>. This flatulence is also
      generated in the abdomen, but, in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i>
      cases, is most troublesome in upper part; yet may extend so far as to cause great meteoristic
      distention, especially in typhoid fevers, dysenteries, etc. It is a remedy of inestimable
      value in h鹵orrhage from any broken down condition of mucous membranes. This action upon the
      mucous membranes does not stop with the alimentary tract, but attacks those of the respiratory
      tract also. Beginning with the larynx, it causes and cures great hoarseness, which is
      characteristically <i><font color="#0000ff">worse in the damp air, especially of evening</font></i>.
      It may be very bad even (if the air is damp) in the morning; but morning hoarseness is oftener
      reached by <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>. This condition may go on extending
      and increasing until it reaches the bronchia.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is particularly true in case of elderly people of broken down
      constitutions, venous system predominating. It is a great remedy for the bronchitis of old
      people; also for asthma of the same, in very desperate cases where the patient appears as if
      dying. Here the choice must be sometimes made between this remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In the chest there is sometimes "<i><font color="#0000ff">burning as
      from glowing coal</font></i>" and again, "weak, fatigued feeling in chest,"
      where the choice may fall between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid, Stannum</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has been found very efficacious in desperate cases of pneumonia, and
      comes in quite naturally after <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i> has failed to
      assist the patient to clear his lungs of the great quantities of loosened mucus, when cyanosis
      and paralysis threaten from weakness. Its sputa then is apt to be f랎id with cold sweat and
      breath and the characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">wanted-to-be-fanned condition</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="justify">Before we leave this remedy I want to emphasize its power over h鹵orrhages,
      which may occur from lungs, nose, stomach, bowels, bladder or any mucous surface. No remedy
      can take its place in broken down, greatly debilitated constitutions where the surfaces from
      which the blood oozes seem too weak and spongy to hold the blood in them. Their vitality is
      gone with the patient's nervous vitality. The patient's face and skin is <i><font color="#0000ff">very pale</font></i>, even before the h鹵orrhage has occurred. <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i> are
