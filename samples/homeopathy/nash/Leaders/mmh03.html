      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The remedy with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> forms the leading trio of Hahnemann's anti-psoric
      remedies. This makes a good starting point, as the boy said when he set a pin in a vacant
      chair. They all act very deeply. Each finds its affinity in a certain class of people or
      temperament. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> acts favourably in all ages, but
      particularly upon old people and children. It acts upon persons of keen intellect, but feeble
      muscular development; lean people, leaning towards lung and liver troubles. Such people are
      apt to suffer from lithic acid diathesis for which this is also great remedy. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> subject is sallow, sunken, with premature lines in the
      face; looks older than he is. Children are weak with well-developed heads, but puny, sickly
      bodies. They are irritable, and when sick awake out of sleep ugly and kick and scream and push
      away the nurse or parents. These temperament remedies are not always appreciated by those who
      do not understand the true spirit of our own art of healing; but when appreciated the skillful
      observer can often see the picture of the right remedy in the face and build of his patient
      before he speaks a word. A remedy must not only be well proven, but extended clinical use and
      observation is necessary to develop it and indicate its true sphere of usefulness. I have
      known temperaments so intensely <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> that they could not take these remedies except in the
      high and highest potencies, and then only in single doses at long intervals. Why should this
      be thought incredible? Carpenter, in his Physiology, tells of a person who was so susceptible
      to Mercury that she was salivated by sleeping with her husband, who had taken <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is one of the leading trio of flatulent remedies, <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> being the
      other two. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> there seems to be an almost
      constant fermentation of gas going on in the abdomen, which produces a loud croaking and
      rumbling. Remember, while <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> bloats the whole abdomen <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>. prefers the upper and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      the lower parts. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> this flatulent condition
      is very apt to occur in connection with chronic liver trouble. Again this rumbling of
      flatulence is often found particularly in the region of the splenic flexure of the colon or
      left hypochondria.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A feeling of satiety is found under this remedy which alternates with a
      feeling of hunger of a peculiar kind. The patient sits down to the table <i><font color="#0000ff">very hungry</font></i>, but the first few mouthfuls fill him right up and he
      feels <i><font color="#0000ff">distressingly</font></i> full; in a Pickwickian sense "too
      full for utterance." This alternation of hunger and satiety is not markedly found under
      any other remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Constipation predominates under <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>,
      and like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> there may be frequent and ineffectual
      desire for stool, but while that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is caused
      by irregular peristaltic action that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> seems
      to be caused by a spasmodic contraction of the anus, which prevents the stool and causes great
      pain.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> should be thought of in anal troubles associated with
      chronic liver troubles, especially if with much flatulence.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> is of use in right sided hernia. It has cured cases
      of long standing without the aid of a truss.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The liver troubles of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> are
      more apt to be of the atrophic variety, while those of <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
      are hypertrophic, both being equally useful in their sphere.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> has almost, if not quite, as marked action upon the
      urinary organs as upon the liver. It is the chief remedy for "<i><font color="#0000ff">red
      sand in the urine</font></i>." This not simply the reddish sediment which is generally
      termed "brick-dust sediment," and which is found under many remedies, but is an
      actual sandy, gritty sediment that settles at the bottom of the otherwise perfectly clear
      urine. Unless thus condition is removed we have sooner or later renal calculi, or gravel
      forming, and terrible attacks of renal colic. In children this sand is sometimes found in the
      diaper after severe crying spells, and in adults much pain in the back in region of kidneys,
      which is relieved after the discharge of urine containing the sand. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax, Sarsaparilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanicula</font></i>).
      No one remedy helps these cases more promptly or permanently than <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> is also one of our best remedies for impotence. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Agnus castus</font></i>). An old man marries his second or third wife and
      finds himself not "equal to the occasion." It is very embarrassing for the whole
      family. A dose of Lycopo<i><font color="#0000ff">d</font></i>ium sets the thing all right and
      makes the doctor a warm friend on both sides of the house.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Young men from onanism or sexual excess become impotent. The penis becomes
      small, cold and relaxed. The desire is as strong as ever, and perhaps more so, but he can't
      perform. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Selenium, Caladium</font></i>). I have known apparently
      hopeless cases of this kind cured by the use of this remedy, high single doses at intervals of
      a week or more.. Give it low, however, if you want to, but do not blame me if you don't
      succeed.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> affects the right side most, or. at least the
      troubles begin on the right side. Swelling and suppuration of the tonsils I have aborted more
      than once in old quinsy subjects by an early dose of this remedy. In fact, I have had such
      success with <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis, Lycopodium, Lac caninum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> that some who employ me for nothing else come for those
      powders that "<i><font color="#0000ff">break up quinsy</font></i>" so quick. In
      diphtheria, if the disease begins in the nose or right tonsil and extends to the left, you
      will think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>, but remember that <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius protoiodide</font></i> also begins on the right side, but there is
      no difficulty in choosing between the two. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bromine</font></i>
      diphtheria begins below and comes upward, just the reverse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>).
      Pains in the abdomen, ovarian and uterine regions also begin in right side, <i><font color="#0000ff">running from right</font></i> to left; right foot gets cold while the other
      remains warm, eruptions begin on right and travel across to left side. Sciatica the same; any
      complaint that begins on right and goes to left makes me think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.
      The "sides of the body" subject is of more account than some imagine. Drugs have an
      affinity for particular parts, organs and even sides of the body.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the respiratory organs this remedy also has a strong influence. It is
      one of our best remedies for chronic dry catarrh of the nose, which becomes completely closed,
      so that' the patient has to breathe through the open mouth, especially at night. Here the
      choice often lies between this remedy, <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium carb</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar Sulphur</font></i>., other symptoms, of course, deciding the choice. In
      infants <i><font color="#0000ff">Sambucus</font></i> comes in for a share of attention.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> has often saved neglected, <i><font color="#0000ff">mal-treated
      or Imperfectly cured cases of pneumonia</font></i> from running into consumption. It may even
      come into the later stages of the acute attack itself, and here as usual the disease is apt to
      be in the right lung, and especially if liver complications arise. The disease has passed the
      first or congestive stage, and generally the stage of hepatization, or is irk the last part of
      this stage, and is trying hard to take a favourable turn into the breaking-up or third stage,
      the stage of resolution. Just here is where many cases die, neither free expectoration, nor
      perfect absorption of the disease product taking place. There is extreme dyspna, the cough
      sounds as if the entire parenchyma of the lung were softened; even raising whole mouthfuls of
      mucus does not afford relief, the breath is short and the wings of the nose expand to their
      utmost with a fan-like motion. Now is the tame when <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      does wonders. Again, even when this stage is imperfectly passed, and the patient still coughs
      and expectorates much thick, yellow, purulent or greyish-yellow, purulent (sometimes ftid)
      Matter, tasting salty, with much rattling in the chest, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      is indispensable Here the choice may have to be made between this remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur, Kali hydroiod</font></i>. or <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>.
      The characteristic aggravation as to time, of this remedy is <i><font color="#0000ff">from 4
      to 8 o'clock</font></i> P. M. <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> has 4 to 9
      aggravation of abdominal pains, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Helleborus Niger</font></i>, of
      the headache, with coryza; but the 4 to 8 aggravations of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      are general, not confined to any one, or one <i><font color="#0000ff">set</font></i> of
      symptoms.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> profoundly impresses the sensorium. We see by
      studying its pathogenesis that it <i><font color="#0000ff">depresses</font></i>. This is found
      particularly in typhoid. The patient lies stupid, eyes do not re-act to light; lower jaw
      drops; apparent impending paralysis of the brain.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This condition may also be found in the advanced stage of many different
      acute diseases such as cerebro-spinal meningitis, typhoid fever, pneumonia, etc. Now if you
      get the 4 to 8 P. M. aggravation this remedy surely comes in. But this depression of the
      sensorium is also found in chronic form. you remember what was said of this remedy in the
      impotence of old men. If you find corresponding failure in the sensorium of old men, the
      memory fails, they use wrong words to express themselves, mix things up generally in writing,
      spelling, and are, in short, unable to do ordinary mental work on account of failing brain
      power, remember <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> Here again <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium, Phosphorus, Baryta</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
      may come in for comparison. Also <i><font color="#0000ff">Picric acid</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Agnus castus</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Many more things might be written of this wonderful polychrest, but I have
      given the most important. Its strongest curative powers are not developed below the 12th
      potency, hence neither the old school nor the homopaths who confine themselves exclusively
      to the low preparations know much about it. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i>,
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      its best powers are only developed by Hahnemann's peculiar process of potentization;
      "prove all things; hold fast that which is good."</p>

      open, sitting or lying.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I now come to an attempt to give some idea of the curative sphere of
      Hahnemann's king of anti-psorics. I do not in this place feel it incumbent upon me to enter
      into a defense of Hahnemann's psora theory against those who discard it because they do not
      understand it. With those who do understand and profit by it there is no need of such defense.
      The truth stands confirmed (with those who have put to the test Hahnemann's rules for the use
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>) that it has power to meet and overcome certain
      obstacles to the usual action of drugs when indicated by the symptoms, or least seemingly so.
      That is the reason why the indication as laid down in the books reads: "When seemingly
      indicated drugs do not cure, use <i><font color="#0000ff">Suphur</font></i>," because
      psora is the obstacle to be overcome. If you now ask me, what is psora? I answer in true
      Yankee style, what is scrofula? Perhaps psora is scrofula, or scrofula is psora. Call it
      either or neither. Yet it is present, a something named or unnamed which must be recognized
      and complicates so-called acute diseases. Now there is nothing so very remarkable about this.
      Syphilis does the same. Once contacted or inherited no matter what ordinary acute disease
      appears, we are at times obliged to turn aside from its treatment to give a quietus to the old
      enemy before we can overcome the acute affection. So it is with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      and psora. The orizing and philosphizing, no matter how wise they sound, must go down when
      facts oppose them. (See case of gastralgia under <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
      and neuralgia under <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now upon this symptom -"When carefully selected remedies fail to act
      favorably, etc.," as we said when writing of a certain group under <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> -this is putting it in too wholesale a fashion. Let no
      one understand that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> is the only remedy capable of
      removing psoric complications, but simply that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      will be likely to be oftener indicated here, because it oftener covers the usual
      manifestations of psora in its pathogenesis than any other remedy. There are anti-psorics,
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum, Causticum, Graphites</font></i>, etc., which may have
      to be used instead of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. And we know which one by
      the same law which guides us in the selection of the right remedy any time. Another thing must
      not be forgotten. All the anti-psoric remedies have their own individual sphere of action
      outside their anti-psoric powers; and often a close study of the case in hand, where other
      remedies have failed, as we had supposed, on account of psora, will reveal that the
      anti-psoric remedy was the true simillimum from the start, independent of any psoric element.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">To undertake to go over the whole range of action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> would be simply to give its whole symptomatology. That is
      riot the object of these notes, but we can notice only the <i><font color="#0000ff">red line</font></i>
      indications which lead the careful prescriber to its further study in the Materia Medica.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One of the chief characteristics of this remedy is found under the head or
      rubric of sensation, viz., that of <b><font color="#ff0000">Burning</font></b>. Burning on
      vertex (outer and inner head); burning in eyes, painful smarting; burning water from nose;
      burning in face without redness; burning pain in tongue; burning vesicles in mouth; sore
      throat with great burning and dryness, first right, then left; burning in stomach; burning and
      pressure in rectum; burning and itching in hæmorrhoids; burning in anus; burning in urethra;
      burning in vagina, scarcely able to keep still; nipples burn like fire; burning in chest,
      rising to face; burning between scapulæ (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phos</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycop</font></i>.); burning of hands; burning of feet; puts them out of bed to
      cool them; hot flushes and burning all over; burning skin of whole body; itching eruptions
      burn after scratching.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">After reading such a list of burning in the cured and characteristic
      symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> one does not wonder that hell is
      represented as being heated by this substance, for it seems by its pathogenesis as though it
      were <i><font color="#0000ff">eternally burning. Arsenicum album, Phosphorus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> lead the list in our Materia Medica for <i><font color="#0000ff">burners</font></i>. These burning sensations are found in both acute and
      chronic diseases. Of course there are several other remedies that have this symptom in an
      intense degrees and must be chosen if the other symptoms come in to complete the picture of
      similarity. Among these of first importance may be named <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite,
      Agaricus, Apis, Belladonna, Cantharis, Capsicum, Carbo animalis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid.</font></i> I think <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
      leads in all acute diseases, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> leads in
      chronic affections We, as homopathists, do not yet fully appreciate the value of <i><font color="#0000ff">sensations</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> upon the
      circulation is to cause and cure local congestions and a chronic tendency thereto. In other
      words, it seems to have the power of equalizing the circulation in persons subject to such
      local congestions and inflammations. These, either acute or chronic congestions, may manifest
      themselves in boils, swellings, felons, abdominal or portal congestions and inflammations, and
      here it is especially indicated if caused by suppressed hæmorrhoids; congestions to the head
      may result from the same cause; the chest becomes congested, when there is great difficulty of
      breathing; <i><font color="#0000ff">feels so oppressed that he wants doors and windows open</font></i>.
      This rush of blood seems to fill the whole chest, the heart feels as if "too full,"
      palpitates and labours, as if trying to rid itself of a burden.</p>

      red</font></i>. All these are manifest indications for <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>.
      Especially is the true if these symptoms follow, or are consequent upon, the suppression or
      retrocession of some eruption or skin trouble. If inward affections work outward towards the
      surface there is not usually cause for alarm, but it they go the other way look out for
      breakers, there is shipwreck ahead. No one need tell me that there is no relation of skin to
      internal troubles. I have seen too much of it, and have cured many cases of that character,
      where a restoration of the skin disease relieved the internal which had followed its
      retrocession or suppression.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is one thing about <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> that
      it often under-estimated by the profession in general, viz., its power of absorption. It is
      after the stage of effusion has set in or even later when this stage is passed and the results
      of the inflammatory process are to be gotten rid of; like the enlargement of the joints in
      rheumatism, <i><font color="#0000ff">exudations into serous sacs, pleura, meningeal membranes,
      peritoneum</font></i>, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> is one of the remedies
      first thought of in these cases, and we have another remedy that is making a record for itself
      here, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali muriaticum</font></i>; but when the case is
      complicated by psora and, especially, when the characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">burnings</font></i>
      stand out prominently <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> is almost sure to be needed
      before the case is finished. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> complement each other; but, of course, the symptoms must
      decide and may decide in favor of neither of them. Right here it may be well to speak of that
      power possessed by <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> of arousing or exciting
      defective reaction. Your former remedy was well chosen and seemed to help the patient in a
      measure, but the case <i><font color="#0000ff">relapses</font></i>, lingers or progresses
      slowly to perfect recovery. It is on account of a depression of the <i><font color="#0000ff">vital
      force</font></i>, as Hahnemann would call it. It may be on account of psora or not. Now give a
      dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> and let it act a few hours if in an acute
      case, or number of days if chronic. Then you may return to your former remedy and get results
      which you could not before the <i><font color="#0000ff">Suphur</font></i> was given. It clears
      up the case and prevents its becoming chronic or a lingering unsatifactory convalescence.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No remedy has more general, positive and persistent action upon the skin
      than <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. With or without eruption, itching and <i><font color="#0000ff">burning,</font></i> are the characteristic sensations attending the skin
      symptoms. If any one doubts the itch-producing power of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      let him work a day or two in the bleaching room of a broom factory. I have tried the
      experiment, and we all remember the fact that our mothers and grandmothers used to cure or
      rather over-cure itch with it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So strong is this affinity of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      far the skin that it seems bent on pushing everything internal out on the surface. Especially
      is this true if it is something that naturally belongs there. Over twenty-five years ago I had
      a case that illustrates this. A lady (maiden) had been an invalid for fourteen years. Her
      trouble seemed to center in her stomach. So that for all that long period of time she could
      eat nothing but at little Graham bread and milk, hardly enough to sustain life and in the
      earlier part of her sickness for a long time was able only to take a teaspoonfull of milk at a
      time. She was an almost literal walking skeleton. I found, after much questioning and several
      failures to relieve her much, that about fifteen years before she had with an ointment
      suppressed an eczema of the nape and occiput. She boasted that she had never seen a vestige of
      it since. I gave that lady Sulphur 200th and in three weeks from that time had that eruption
      fully restored and her stomach trouble completely relieved. The deacon of her (Presbyterian)
      church exclaimed as she came walking up a long hill to service, "Here comes Susan F., who
      has been dying for the last fourteen years and lo and behold, she is the biggest, fattest one
      among us!" Now how about the relation of skin to internal trouble? I can report a number
      of as convincing cases in my own practice cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur,
      Arsenicum, Causticum</font></i> or other remedies. One thing must be recognized and never lost
      sight of, viz., that <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i> <i><font color="#0000ff">weigh</font></i>
      whether we can give the pathological interpretation of them or not. Here are a few of that
      kind from the pathogenesis of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Particularly efficacious with lean, stoop-shouldered persons, who
      walk or sit stooped; standing is the most uncomfortable position."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Dirty, filthy people, prone to skin affections."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Children cannot bear to be washed or bathed."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Voluptuous itching; scratching relieves; after it burning."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Complaints continually relapsing."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Congestion to single parts."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pain in heart, extending to back."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Scrofulous (psoric) chronic diseases that result from suppressed
      eruptions."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Discharges from every outlet acrid, excoriating and reddening."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Offensive odor of body despite frequent bathing."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Hot flushes with spells of faintness, or debility passing off with a
      little moisture, faintness or debility."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Weak, faint spells frequently during the day."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Burning in feet, wants to find a cool place for them; puts them out
      of bed to cool them off." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla, Medorrhinum, Sanicula</font></i>.)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Feels suffocated; wants doors and windows open, particularly at
      night."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Diarrha after midnight; Painlessly driving out of bed early in the
      morning, as if the bowels were too weak to retain their contents."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Weak, empty, gone or faint feeling in stomach about 11 A. M."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"White tongue with very red tip and borders."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Bright redness of lips as if the blood would burst through." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Heat on crown of head; cold feet; frequent flushing."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Every true homopath knows the value of these and many more symptoms of
      this remedy. No one else appreciates them. Again, none but those who use the potentized <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> can ever know what it is capable of curing.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is another of Hahnemann's constitutional remedies which, as Farrington
      says, "may come into use, in almost any form of disease." We may say come into use
      because it may be on account of certain idiosyncrasies. which come under the remedial power of
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> that the disease, whatever it is, is made less
      amenable to ordinary treatment.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The temperament of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> is
      altogether different from that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. You remember
      the lean stoop-shouldered <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> subject. <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> is on the contrary what cannot be better expressed than in
      the term used by Henry N. Guernsey viz.; <b><font color="#ff0000">Leocophlegmatic temperament</font></b>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> patient is
      constitutionally fat, over-fat or strongly inclined to obesity. The color of the skin is
      white, watery or chalky pale. Of torpid disposition (especially children), sluggish or slow in
      its movements. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> is almost the exact opposite,
      quick, wiry, nervous, active. There is none of the bilious, swarthy, yellowish appearance in <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> that we find in <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.
      These three remedies <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea, Sulphur, Lycopodium</font></i> are a
      trio that find each their counterpart in many persons the world over. Of course we find the
      tendency to obesity under other remedies, as for instance, under <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>,
      but with this obesity we almost always find accompanying it the peculiar skin troubles of <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>. Sometimes we seem to find a condition that seems to
      simulate each remedy in some one feature; for instance, the obesic temperament of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> and the eruptive tendency of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>.
      This may combine so as to make a case that will be covered by <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar
      sulph</font></i>. Such cases are more difficult to cover with a perfect simillimum. But when
      we do find a purely <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> subject the fact is inestimable as a help to
      a brilliant result in many cases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Malnutrition is one of the disorders calling for the exhibition of this
      remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Tardy development of the bony tissues with lymphatic
      enlargements."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Curvature of the bones, especially spine and long bones."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Extremities deformed, crooked."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Softening of the bones; <i><font color="#0000ff">fontanelles remain
      open too long</font></i> and skull very large."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These symptoms are quoted from "Hering's Guiding Symptoms," and
      show the lack of, or imperfect, nutrition of bones. They are nourished irregularly, or
      unevenly. One part of a bone, the vertebræs for instance, is nourished while the other is
      starved. While all this irregular bone development is going on the soft parts are suffering
      from over-nutrition. Thus we have recorded in the pathogenesis: "Tendency to obesity
      especially in children and young people."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Nutrition impaired with tendency to glandular enlargements."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Granular vegetations: polypus (in nose, ear, bladder, uterus,
      etc.)."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a fair picture of the general or constitutional use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ost</font></i>., and it remains to give some of the characteristic or
      peculiar symptoms guiding to its selection.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">When writing of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> we called
      particular attention to the sensation of burning under that remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>
      has characteristically the opposite, viz., <b><font color="#ff0000">Coldness</font></b> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cistus</font></i>.).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Cold, damp feet."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sensation in feet and legs as if she had on cold, damp
      stockings."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Coldness of legs with night-sweats."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Internal and external sensation of coldness of various parts of head
      as if a piece of ice were lying, against it; with pale puffed face."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"She feels a sort of inward coldness."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Aversion to open air, the least cold air goes right through
      her."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All this is so directly opposite to <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      that any confusion between them seems impossible.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensations of coldness in single parts should always call to mind <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>, as well as general coldness. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cistus</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Heloderma</font></i>.)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If Calcarea has one symptom that not only leads all the rest, but also all
      other remedies, it is found in the <b><font color="#ff0000">profuse sweats on head of
      large-headed, open fontanelled children</font></b>. The sweat is so profuse that during sleep
      it rolls down the head and face wetting the pillow far around. Many a little child has been
      saved from dying of hydrocephalus, dentition, rachitis, marasmus, eclampsia, cholera infantum,
      etc., where this sweating symptom was the guiding symptom to the use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>. It is also especially indicated, other symptoms agreeing,
      in sweats of male organs, nape of neck, chest, axilla, hands, knees, feet, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Partial sweats</font></i>. It is also a remedy for night sweats generally when
      they occur in connection with consumption or other debilitating diseases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In all these sweatings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> the
      surface is characteristically cold at the same time, and especially would we find the lower
      extremities cold.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> has characteristic symptoms in the digestive tract. One
      is that everything in the whole length of the tract seems <b><font color="#ff0000">soor</font></b>.
      Eructations sour; sour vomiting of large curds (<i><font color="#0000ff">Æthusa</font></i>);
      sour diarrha. And then there is a sour smell of the whole body. This is not like the
      offensive odor of the body that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> has.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Then there is a peculiar symptom of the appetite that has often been
      verified -"Longing for eggs, particularly in children in sickness or during
      convalescence, even before they are able to swallow. The stomach externally is swollen or
      seems distended, standing right out like an inverted saucer. Abdomen is also much distended
      from hard and swollen mesentery, even when the rest of the body is emaciated."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The diarrha, which may vary as to color and consistence, instead of being
      aggravated in the morning, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur, is worse in the afternoon</font></i>.
      The patient is <b><font color="#ff0000">generally better</font></b> when constipated.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> has not so positive and unvarying action upon the skin
      as <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, but is indispensable in skin affections which
      seem to depend upon some constitutional dyscrasia that it covers in its general action, for
      instance, in eczema capitis or milk crusts. in children of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>
      type. Here, of course, no remedy can take its place. Indeed all skin troubles in <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> subjects disappear when through its action the system is
      set right, showing that the skin troubles after all were only secondary. The skin of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> subject is generally cold, soft and flabby.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We must not omit to notice the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">ost</font></i>. on the respiratory organs, for the reason that it is
      of great importance in its use in that dread disease, pulmonary consumption. Whether, as
      Professor Bennet believes, this disease be essentially one of faulty nutrition or as Virchow
      believes, one of inflammation, or if Professor Rindflesch's theory relegating it to the class
      of diseases known as infections, be true, or whatever its primary cause may be, we know that <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ost</font></i>. is one of the most effective agents, if indicated by
      the temperament and symptoms, in the cure of this malady, and if applied at a stage when a
      cure is at all possible.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Very many cases in the incipient stage come within range of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>. As we have
      already given the leading indications of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, we will
      now give some of them for <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Leucophlegmatic temperament."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Middle and upper portion of right lung." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph</font></i>., upper left.)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Chest painfully sensitive to touch and on inspiration."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Shortness of breath on walking, especially on ascending."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Painless hoarseness, &lt; in the morning."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Especially in women who have always been too early and profuse in
      menstruation, and who have habitually cold feet to the knees."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Tendency to looseness of the bowels, &lt; afternoons."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Appetite failing and emaciation progressing."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here are a few of the prominent indications, and on them many a case has
      been cured. Of course this is generally cough, and it may be tight or loose, yet the case
      rests mainly on the symptoms outside the cough. This remedy in this disease and the success
      attending its use is one of the illustrations of the soundness of Hering's advice when he says
      "treat the patient, not the disease."</p>
