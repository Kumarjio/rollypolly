      <p align="JUSTIFY">Silicea is another of our invaluable constitutional remedies, and also one
      which is of little or no use except as developed by Hahnemann's process of potentization. Like
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>, it is especially useful in sweaty-headed
      children (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sanicula</font></i>) with defective assimilation. It is not
      in the fat, torpid, obesic patients, over-nourished in one part and insufficiently so in
      another, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> that <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>
      is indicated, but in the over-sensitive, imperfectly nourished (generally), not from want of
      food, but from imperfect assimilation. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> child
      is not larger than natural anywhere except in its "big belly," which is due to
      diseased mesentery. Its limbs are shrunken, its eyes sunken and its face pinched and old
      looking. It does not increase in size or strength, learns to walk late; in short, if not
      actually sick in bed, everything seems to have come to a standstill so far as growth or
      development is concerned. Now if this state of things continues the bowels become very
      constipated, and a peculiar constipation it is, too. The little fellow strains and strains, <i><font color="#0000ff">the stool partly protruding and then slipping back</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sanicula</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>), as though
      the general weakness of the patient affected the expulsive power of the rectum, or else the
      bowels become very persistently loose, especially during dentition or the hot weather of
      summer. The stools are changeable, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> does no
      good, almost every kind and color of loose stool appearing. The child takes nourishment
      enough, but, whether vomited or retained, goes on emaciating and growing weaker and weaker
      until it dies of inanition, unless <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> checks this
      process. Many such cases have I saved with this remedy and made them healthy children. I have
      always used the 30th and upwards, hence cannot speak of the lower preparations. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> also has constipation &lt; before and during menstruation).</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> ranks among the first of our remedies for inflammations
      ending in suppuration. It seems to make no particular difference whether the suppuration takes
      place in the soft or hard parts, for it is equally efficacious in glandular or bony
      ulcerations. It seems to come in at a later stage than <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulph</font></i>.
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> <i><font color="#0000ff">sulphide</font></i>
      which expedite the discharge of pus already formed, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>
      comes in for healing after the discharge has taken place. Cellular tissues with deep-seated
      suppurations, including tendons and ligaments, also come within the range of its healing
      powers. In these cases the constitution of the patient has an important bearing in the
      selection of this remedy. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> subject is weakly,
      with fine skin, pale face, lax muscles. Even the mind and nervous symptoms come into the
      general picture of "weakness." He is nervous and irritable, weak, faint-hearted,
      yielding, giving-up disposition, "grit all gone." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>).
      In such a case <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> is grand. I hate to use the term,
      but as the old school would say, "it builds them up," and so it seems, for under its
      action the patients spirits rise, hope revives, the weakness and depression give way to a
      feeling of returning strength and health. It makes no difference whether the ulcerations are
      in the tissues already named, in the lungs, intestinal tract, or mammæ, or elsewhere, the
      effect is the same, and the improvement in the local affection generally follows the general
      constitutional improvement. This condition of weakness seems to attack the general nervous
      system, affecting the spine, and so we get those cerebro-spinal headaches, or headaches
      beginning in the nape of the neck and running forward over the head to the eyes, for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> is so useful. <i><font color="#0000ff">Vertigo</font></i>
      also ascends from the nape to head, &lt; looking up. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There seems to be lack of nerve power to resist outward depressing
      influences. He is cold, or, as Hering puts it, there is "<i><font color="#0000ff">want of
      vital warmth, even when taking exercise</font></i>." He is sensitive to cold air, takes
      cold very easily, especially when uncovering the head or feet. On the contrary, he is relieved
      by "<i><font color="#0000ff">wrapping up the head</font></i>" (<i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia mur</font></i>.), or, in other words, supplying artificially the
      warmth that he lacks naturally.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have several times found a <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>
      child suffering from epileptiform spasms which were always worse at new moon. A few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> 200th set them all right.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Silicea subjects are often afflicted with offensive foot-sweats (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sanicula, Psorinum, Graphites</font></i>), which are easily suppressed by
      getting the feet cold. Such suppression must be remedied, the sweat restored and cured by
      proper medication or serious results often follow, such as convulsions and other spinal
      troubles, even locomotor ataxia. <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> is the remedy to
      restore and cure such sweats by correcting the conditions upon which the sweats depend. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta carb., Graphites, Psorinum, Sanicula</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> patient desires to be
      magnetized and is relieved thereby (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is one of the remedies of which, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia,
      Lachesis, Lycopodium</font></i> and others, the old school knows little or nothing, because
      their chief virtues are only developed in potencies above the 12th.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We will now take up what I call the trio of <b><font color="#ff0000">restless</font></b>
      remedies; viz: <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Arsenicum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All are equally restless, yet all are so very different that there is no
      difficulty in choosing between them. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      restlessness is oftenest found in a high grade of synochal or inflammatory fevers. There is no
      better picture in a few words of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> fever than is
      given by Hering -"Heat, with thirst; hard, full and frequent pulse, anxious impatience,
      inappeasable, beside himself, tossing about with agony."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The custom of alternating <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> in inflammatory affections, which so widely prevails is
      a senseless one. Both remedies cannot be indicated at a time, and if a good effect follows
      their administration you may be sure that the <i><font color="#0000ff">indicated one</font></i>
      cured in spite of the action of the other, which only hindered; or that the patient recovered
      without help from either. There are many cases of this kind where the doctor is congratulating
      himself on a cure which was only a recovery, for which he deserves no credit at all. Let us
      look for a moment at some of the diagnostic differences of these two remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both have great heat of the skin, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      has characteristically <i><font color="#0000ff">dry, hot skin</font></i> and no sweat; <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> has even greater surface heat, but sweats on <i><font color="#0000ff">covered parts</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> tosses about in agony with great fear of death; <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> often has semi-stupor and jerks and twitches in sleep. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> has great distress in heart and chest; <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> everything seems to centre in the head. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> fears death without much delirium; <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      fears imaginary things, with delirium. Thus we might continue to give points of difference. No
      man who understands the homopathic art of healing will ever alternate these two remedies.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> is also a great <b><font color="#ff0000">pain</font></b>
      remedy. If we were to name the three leading remedies in this respect it would be <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Chamomilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i>.
      The <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> pains are always attended by the extreme
      restlessness, anxiety and fearfulness of this remedy. The patient tosses about in agony,
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">cannot bear the pain</font></i>, nor bear to be touched, nor to
      be uncovered." Well, you say, all remedies have pain. Not all, and not many so intense
      pain. <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>
      have painlessness oftener than pain. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> pains are
      intolerable and generally worse in the evening or at night. Then we have often alternating
      with or sometimes even in conjunction with the pains <i><font color="#0000ff">numbness,
      tingling</font></i>, or <i><font color="#0000ff">formication</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In this it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>., but
      with <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> the pains predominate, while with <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. the <b><font color="#ff0000">numbness</font></b>, with
      dull aching and soreness, leads. The pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> are
      tearing, cutting pains, which drive the patient to desperation. Right here we may as well
      speak of the leading characteristic of this remedy, for it is almost always present when <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> is clearly indicated. Just one word expressed it: <b><font color="#ff0000">Fear </font></b>-<i><font color="#0000ff">fear of death</font></i> especially,
      but fear to cross the street, fear to go into society, fear something is going to happen, ever
      present, undefinable, unreasonable fear. No remedy has it in such a degree as this one. It is
      the fear as much as the pain that makes the patient so full of that agonized restlessness. The
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> restlessness goes with extreme prostration and
      reduced vitality. <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>., on account of the aching
      pains, which make him want to move for the temporary relief he gets from the movement. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> wants to move from place to place, but is <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> relieved. Neither <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      nor <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> get such relief from movement, nor does <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> <b><font color="#ff0000">fear</font></b> like <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>, or at least in any such degree. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>,
      as a fever remedy, has been greatly abused. Even the old school, astonished at the results of
      homopathic treatment, so superior to their so-called anti-phlogistic treatment, and finding <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> so highly recommended and frequently used in inflammatory
      affections, concluded in accordance with their usual way of reasoning that <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> could be squeezed into their pathological livery and made
      to do service in all kinds of fever simply because it <b><font color="#ff0000">was</font></b>
      fever. But they soon found that however useful it might be in some cases of inflammatory
      fever, it was of no use in typhoids. Thus was generalization from a pathological standpoint
      again doomed to disappointment, as it always must be. Now many so-called homopaths have
      fallen into similar error by concluding that because <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      did quickly cure in some cases having a high grade of fever, that therefore it was always the
      remedy with which to treat cases having high fever. They even fell into the routine habit of
      prescribing this remedy for the first stage of all inflammatory affections, and follow it with
      other remedies more appropriate to the whole case further on. If <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      were the only remedy having inflammatory fever, perhaps we could do no better than to zig-zag
      the case to a cure this way. Dunham writes: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      is never to be given first to subdue the fever and then some other remedy 'to meet the case,'
      never to be alternated with other drugs for the purpose, as is often alleged, of 'controlling
      the fever.' If the fever be such as to require <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>, no
      other drug is needed. If other drugs seem indicated one should be sought which meets the fever
      as well, for many drugs besides <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> produce fever,
      each after its kind."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">True words, and as one reads them who has proved their truthfulness and
      remembers they great author, he feels like exclaiming, "Being dead, yet speaketh." <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> has two very important modalities, viz., fright and dry
      cold air. We have already noticed the value of the <i><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></i> of
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> as a symptom, connected with acute inflammatory
      ailments. It is no less a remedy for ailments brought on by fright, either immediate or
      remote. The patient has received a fright in the dark and is always afraid in the dark
      afterwards. From fright vertigo comes on, or fainting; trembling; threatened abortion, or
      suppressed menstruation, Jaundice may be induced by it, and become chronic. There are other
      remedies for fright, prominent among which are <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium, Ignatia,
      Veratrum album</font></i>, etc. Now in regard to the <i><font color="#0000ff">dry cold air</font></i>.
      No remedy has more prominently acute inflammations arising from dry, cold air. Nineteen out of
      twenty cases of croup arising from exposure to dry, cold air will be cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>. I live in a locality where croup abounds and have had
      abundant opportunity to verify this. <i><font color="#0000ff">Pleurisy, pneumonia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">rheumatism</font></i> also come under this head, and they are, as
      would be expected, almost invariably accompanied by the high fever, anguish, restlessness and
      fear so characteristic of this remedy. Any local congestion or inflammation coming from such
      exposure also comes under the same rule, always providing the other symptoms corresponds The
      other leading dry air remedies are <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia, Causticum, Hepar sulph</font></i>.,
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>. Here are some wet weather remedies: <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara, Nux moschata, Natrum sulphuricum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i>. Such things are well to remember, for one
      positive indication is worth two or three vague ones.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No remedy is more restless than this one. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      restlessness comes in the earlier stages of inflammatory diseases, with fever of a high grade.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> in the later stages, after the patient has
      become greatly reduced in strength, or in low grades of fever like typhoids. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> patient tosses to and fro in agony and fear. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> patient is too wealth to toss as the anguish and
      restlessness would incline him to. He cannot move himself around as he desires, but wants to
      be moved from place to place, or bed to bed, while the least exertion on his own part exhausts
      terribly. He has fear of death, but not like the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      fear, but rather an anxiety and a feeling that it is useless to take medicine for he is going
      to die; he is incurable.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mental restlessness is as great as the bodily. He has attacks of
      anxiety that drive him out of bed at night. Even when there is no pain at all he wants to be
      continually changing place, walking about if strong enough, without any other reason than that
      he can't keep still. Often the first beneficial effect to be observed in cases calling for
      this remedy is that the anxiety grows less, the patient lies still, his pain is not so much
      less, but it does not make him so restless; he can bear it better. This is a good sign and is
      generally followed by amelioration of all the symptoms. It makes little difference what the
      disease, if this persistent restlessness and especially if great weakness is also present,
      don't forget <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Arsenicum leads all the remedies for <b><font color="#ff0000">burning</font></b>
      sensation, especially in acute diseases. It is not by any means confined to acute diseases,
      but is often found in chronic affections, especially of a malignant character or tending to
      malignancy. I think perhaps <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> outranks it generally
      for burnings in chronic affections. There is hardly an organ or tissue in the human system
      where these burnings of Arsenic are not found. This burning, strange as it may seem, is
      greatly <b><font color="#ff0000">ameliorated by heat</font></b>. Hot applications if they can
      be gotten in contact with the part, also heat of a warm stove or warm room. This is the exact
      opposite of <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale cornutum</font></i>, for while the part is
      objectively cold, it still <i><font color="#0000ff">burns</font></i>, but hot applications are
      intolerable; they cannot even bear to have it covered; with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>,
      in throat complaints, in connection with acute catarrh, the burnings in throat and from the
      excoriating nasal discharge ameliorated by hot application. The burning in throat is better
      from eating or drinking hot things. This is the chief modality which enables us to choose
      between this remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cepa</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>,
      for all the three have fluent coryza. I once had a case of very severe gastralgia caused by
      suppression of eczema on the hands. I knew nothing of the suppression, but prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> because the pains came on at midnight, lasting until 3 A.
      M., during which time the patient had to walk the floor in agony and there was <i><font color="#0000ff">great burning</font></i> in the stomach. She had but one slight attack after
      taking <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>, but, said she, when I visited her,
      "Doctor, would that remedy send out salt rheum?" Then I found out about the
      suppression which had been caused by the application of an ointment, and told her that she
      could have back the pain in the stomach any time she wanted it, by suppressing the eruption
      again. She did not want it.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> is one of our best remedies for fevers of a typhoid
      character. So useful is it that Baehr says -"Since <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
      is, more than any other remedy, adapted to the worst forms of infectious diseases it seems
      wrong to delay its administration until the symptoms indicating it are developed in their most
      malignant intensity," and further, "our advice, therefore, is that <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> should be given more frequently than has been customary
      from the very beginning of the attack, and that we should not wait until the disease has fully
      developed its pernicious character." I do not think this is sound reasoning or good
      advice, for I have never found any rule by which I could decide from the beginning that a case
      would later on develop into a case of the pernicious or malignant character which would ever
      call for the exhibition of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>. While we need not wait
      for a case to develop to that "most malignant" intensity which calls for <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>, we would not on the other hand be justified in giving <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> or any other remedy in anticipation of a condition which
      might never come. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> is not the only remedy capable
      of curing these malignant cases, and how do we know after all that it may not be <i><font color="#0000ff">Muriatic acid</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i>
      that will be the remedy after the case is developed. There is no safe or scientific rule but
      to treat the case with the <i><font color="#0000ff">indicated</font></i> remedy at any and all
      stages of the disease, without trying to treat expected conditions or future possibilities. It
      would be out of place here to give all the indications for <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
      in typhoids, as it would take too much space, and they can be found in Raue, Lilienthal or any
      good work on practice. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is also fine of our best
      remedies in intermittents, especially after the abuse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>.
      Close individualization is necessary here as elsewhere.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> profoundly affects the alimentary canal from lips to
      anus. The lips are so dry and parched and cracked that the patient often licks them to moisten
      them. The tongue is affected in various ways. It may be dry and red, with raised papillæ; or
      red, with indented edges; or white as chalk or white paint; or lead colored, or dry, brown or
      black, especially in typhoids. The mouth is dry or aphthous, ulcerated or gangrenous. The
      throat the same. The thirst is indescribably intense and peculiar, in that notwithstanding its
      intensity the patient can <i><font color="#0000ff">take only a little water at a time</font></i>.
      The stomach is so irritable that the least food or drink causes distress and pain, or
      immediately excites vomiting, or stool, or both together. Cold drinks, ice-water, or ice-cream
      particularly disagree and create distress. Vomits all kinds and grades of substances from
      water or mucus to bile, blood, and coffee ground substances.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains in stomach are terrible and aggravated by the least food or
      drink, especially, if <i><font color="#0000ff">cold</font></i>. The abdominal pains also are
      intense, causing the patient to turn and twist in all possible shapes and directions. Diarrha
      of all kinds of stools, from simply watery to black, bloody and horribly offensive, and
      finally the end of the tract is reached and we have hæmorrhoids. Now in every one of these
      affections, ranging along the whole length of the canal, and from the lightest grade of
      irritation to the most intense inflammatory and malignant forms of disease, we will be apt to
      find everywhere present the characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> of this
      remedy, in greater or lesser degree; and the not less characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">amelioration
      from heat</font></i>, and also, though not quite so invariably, the <i><font color="#0000ff">midnight
      aggravation</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> also has its sphere of usefulness in diseases of the
      respiratory organs. First, for acute coryza it stands in the front rank, the choice often
      having to be made between this remedy, <i><font color="#0000ff">Cepa</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> has the
      fluent discharge which corrodes the lips and wings of the nose and more <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> than the other two remedies. It often follows well after <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> if that remedy only partially relieves.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> is particularly efficacious in many affections of the
      lungs, where the breathing is very much oppressed. Respiration is wheezing, with cough and
      frothy expectoration. Patient cannot lie down; must sit up to breathe, and is unable to move
      without being greatly put out of breath. The air passages seem constricted. It is especially
      useful in asthmatic affections caused or aggravated by suppressed eruptions, like pneumonia
      from retrocedent measles, or even chronic lung troubles from suppressed eczema. I remember a
      case of asthma of years' standing to which I was called at midnight, because they were afraid
      the patient would die before morning. Found that her attacks always came on at 1 A. M. Gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> <i><font color="#0000ff">alb</font></i>. 30th, and she
      was completely cured by it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The symptom by Rollin R. Gregg, "Acute, sharp, fixed or darting pain
      in apex and through upper third of right lung," is a gem, and has enabled me to cure a
      number of cases of obstinate lung troubles. In the last stage off pneumonia of old people,
      with gangrenous expectoration, if the other symptoms correspond, this remedy has often saved
      life. The burning is often found here as elsewhere. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
      is also one of our best remedies in pleuritic effusions.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> also affects profoundly the nervous system. To the
      characteristic restlessness, of which we have said so much, is added <b><font color="#ff0000">great
      Prostration</font></b>. This prostration is present in most diseases, both acute and chronic,
      where <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> is indicated. For instance, in typhoids
      there is no remedy that prostrates more. <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Muriatic acid</font></i> equal it, the difference being that the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> patient wants to move or be moved constantly, while with
      the other two remedies there is almost utter absence of any such show of life. Even if not
      confined to the bed, in acute or chronic diseases the patient is so weak that he is
      "exhausted from the slightest exertion," must lie down. Sometimes this extreme
      degree of prostration comes on very rapidly.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is a picture that shows a condition of things in chronic trouble
      calling for this remedy. "From climbing mountains, or other muscular exertions, want of
      breath, prostration, sleeplessness and other ailments." This shows how weak the patient
      is, and this weakness may be coupled with various forms of disease. You may say it is common
      for sick people to be weak. True, but the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
      patient is weak <i><font color="#0000ff">out off proportion</font></i> to the rest of his
      trouble, or apparently so; and it is a <i><font color="#0000ff">general prostration</font></i>,
      not local like the sense of weakness in the chest of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid,
      Stannum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>; or in the abdomen like <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>; or in the stomach like <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>,
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Hydrastis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>.
      Now I do not see how I can make plainer the value of prostration as an <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> symptom.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is the third remedy of our so-called restless trio. This restlessness
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> is on account of the aching pain and soreness
      which is temporarily relieved by movement. There is also an internal uneasiness which is
      purely nervous, which causes the patient to want to be on the move, even when there is no
      particular pain present; but not nearly to the degree that we find it under <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As in <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, so in <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>, the leading characteristic is found in its modality. The
      aggravation on movement, in the former, is no less marked than the <b><font color="#ff0000">aggravation</font></b>
      when quiet of the latter. The patient tosses and turns from side to side with <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> the same as with <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum.</font></i> With <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>
      the change relieves, while with the other two it does not. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>,
      the more the patient moves the more he suffers, while with <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>,
      the more and longer he moves the better he feels, until he is exhausted. In acute affections,
      like scarlatina and typhoid fevers, and even in the hot stage of intermittent fever, constant
      movement seems to be the patient's only relief. With chronic diseases like chronic rheumatism
      the patient must move, suffers on first beginning to move, but as he continues to move, or as
      he expresses it, "gets limbered up," he feels better. But he cannot long lie
      comfortably in either the acute or chronic trouble, for the aching comes on and he must move
      even if it does hurt him at first. The pains causing the restlessness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> are not so agonizing as they are under <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>, nor is
      the prostration so great as under <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> nor the
      excitement so great as under <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> are often
      indicated in typhoids, <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> seldom or never, but all
      three are equally <i><font color="#0000ff">restless</font></i> remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If in genuine typhoid <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>, as
      some think, heads the list, because oftenest indicated, <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>
      will put in equally strong claims in all other diseases that take on typhoid symptoms. The
      literal meaning of the term or word typhus is <i><font color="#0000ff">smoke, stupefaction</font></i>.
      Now in all forms of typhus, known as cerebral, abdominal and pneumo-typhus, taking all
      together, <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> will be as often indicated as any other
      remedy. Whenever in fevers or even inflammatory diseases the sensorium becomes cloudy (smoky)
      or stupefaction sets in, with low grade of muttering delirium, dry tongue, etc., we think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>. Dry or dark coated tongue, with <b><font color="#ff0000">triangular
      red tip</font></b>, is especial indication for this remedy. This condition of sensorium and
      tongue may appear in <i><font color="#0000ff">dysentery, peritonitis, pneumonia, scarlatina,
      rheumatism, diphtheria; bilious, remittent, typhoid fevers</font></i>, etc. It makes no
      difference what the name or locality of the disease is if the <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i>
      are there. The stupefaction calling for <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> in these
      diseases is not so profound as that calling for <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">opium</font></i>, but is more on a parallel with such remedies as <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata, Lachesis</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid.</font></i> Nor is the delirium so violent as that
      calling for such remedies as <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna, Hyoscyamus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>. Both stupefaction and delirium are mild in form, but
      regular and persistent. Of course the <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus restlessness</font></i> is
      present and the patient tosses or turns from side to side, even without knowing of it, or of
      anything going on around her. She will answer questions and perhaps answer correctly, but
      afterwards does not know anything that transpired while she was sick, may be for days or
      weeks.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">

      closely resemble each other; and choice is sometimes difficult; but we will try to
      differentiate them when we come to write upon the two latter.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Cough during chill in intermittents</font></i> is a characteristic given us
      by Carroll Dunham, and is very reliable, as I have had occasion to prove.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> acts particularly on fibrous, muscular and cellular
      tissues. The muscles are stiff and sore. This may be of a rheumatic character, or may have
      been induced by straining, by heavy lifting or severe muscular exercise of any kind, or it may
      have been brought on by exposure to cold, especially wet cold.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This strained condition may not be confined to the muscles alone, but may
      involve the tendons, ligaments and membranes of the joints. Several affections of the muscles
      of the back and even the spinal membranes (myelitis) may come on from sprain, or by exposure,
      by sleeping on damp ground, or in bed with damp sheets, or getting wet in a rain storm,
      especially while perspiring. Indeed <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> is one of our
      best remedies in lumbago. But it makes no particular difference what muscles are strained or
      exposed so as to bring on this lameness and soreness the remedy is the same, and if the great
      characteristic -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Lameness and stiffness and pain on first moving
      after rest, or on getting up in the morning, relieved by continued motion</font></i>," is
      present, <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> is the first remedy to think of.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Rhus is also often a remedy for glandular swelling of parotid or
      submaxillary glands during scarlatina, cellulitis in diphtheria, or orbital cellulitis.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is also one of our best remedies in skin diseases. No one who has been
      poisoned by it will doubt that <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> has power to produce
      skin disease, and of course in accordance with our law of cure we would expect cures by it. We
      have not been disappointed. The eruption of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> poisoning
      is vesicular. <i><font color="#0000ff">Erysipelas of the vesicular variety</font></i>,
      accompanied by the restlessness and sensorium of this remedy, is quickly cured by it. So,
      also, is <i><font color="#0000ff">scarlatina</font></i>. If we find the skin red, smooth and
      shiny, with high grade of fever and delirium <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> would
      not do any good, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> or some remedy having that
      kind of skin, etc.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Apis, Cantharis, Lachesis, Ailanthus</font></i> and others have each their
      peculiar appearance of the skin in these acute exanthemata. Yet, notwithstanding this, it must
      be <i><font color="#0000ff">remembered</font></i> that in many cases the leading indication
      for a remedy will not lie in the skin symptoms, but outside of them.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If in <i><font color="#0000ff">variola</font></i> the eruption turns livid
      and typhoid symptoms supervene we may rely on <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> for a
      good effect. Probably no remedy is oftener found useful in <i><font color="#0000ff">herpes
      zoster</font></i> than this.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="justify"><i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> is no less valuable in chronic skin troubles than in acute.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Eczemas</font></i> of the vesicular type are often cured by it; there
      is much itching which is not greatly relieved by scratching. In all such cases of course the
