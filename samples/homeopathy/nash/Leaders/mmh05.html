      <p align="JUSTIFY">All acute inflammatory diseases present prominent head symptoms, pain, red

      sometimes greatly swollen; all mucous surfaces correspondingly dry and hot.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains appear suddenly, and after a while disappear as suddenly as they
      came.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Skin very red and hot, fairly radiates heat; burns the hand touching it,
      but sweats on covered parts.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Several inflammations which streak out in radii from a center.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Modalities: &lt; after 3 P. M. or after midnight from uncovering, or draft
      of air, and lying down; &gt; from covering and head high.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Great liability to take cold; sensitive to draft of air, especially when
      uncovering the head; from having the hair cut (<i><font color="#0000ff">Hep</font></i>.);
      tonsils swell after riding in a cold wind (<i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.).</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We now come to consider what I call the trio of delirium remedies -<i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna, Hyoscyamus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>.
      Many other remedies have delirium, but these three deserve to head the list. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> may also be called pre-eminently a head remedy. In most
      complaints where this remedy is indicated head symptoms preponderate. The <i><font color="#0000ff">blood</font></i> all seems to be rushing to the head. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Amyl nitrite, Glonoine, Melilotus</font></i>). The head is hot while the
      extremities are cool. The eyes are red and blood-shot. The face is also red, almost purple
      red. The carotid arteries throb so as to be plainly visible. There is either great pain,
      pressure or sense of fullness, or an almost stupid condition. The wild, terrible delirium, if
      present, may be found with pain, or even with no complaint of pain. In delirium the patient
      "imagines he sees ghosts, hideous faces and animals and insects." Fears all sorts of
      imaginary things and wants to run away from them; breaks out into fits of laughter or screams
      and gnashes his teeth; bites or strikes those around him; in short, Performs all sorts of
      violent acts and is controlled with great difficulty. No remedy has more presistently <i><font color="#0000ff">violent delirium</font></i> than <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>.
      One of the characteristic features of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> in
      delirium as compared with the other two remedies is the decided evidence already mentioned of
      a surcharge of blood in the brain. When the throbbing of the carotids, the heat, redness and
      congestion of face and conjunctiva go away, the delirium subsides in proportion. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> may have delirium with pale face as its alternate, but
      it is the exception. Even the upper lip is congested and swollen.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In inflammations, which <i><font color="#0000ff">localize</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> is in the first stage as often the leading remedy as any
      other. It does not make much difference <b><font color="#ff0000">where</font></b> they
      localize, whether in head, throat, mammæ or elsewhere, if they come on suddenly, pursue a
      rapid course, are red, painful and especially throbbing. It is astonishing how many local
      inflammations, even a carbuncle or boil, will so disturb the general system and circulation,
      as to produce the general inflammatory fever, with the characteristic head symptoms calling
      for <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>, and no less astonishing how this remedy
      controls the whole condition, both local and general, when indicated. What! exclaims the
      believer in local applications, give <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> internally
      for a boil on the hand or foot? Yes, indeed, not only <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>,
      but <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius, Hepar Sulphuris, Tarantula Cubensis</font></i>, and
      many others, and you will not have any need for local medication at all. It is only in the
      first or congestive or active inflammatory stage that this remedy is in place; but, if
      properly administered then, it will often abort the whole thing and never leave it to finish
      all its stages, or if not, so modify as to make it comparatively insignificant.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> is one of our best remedies in the diseases of
      children, even vieing with <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>. They come <i><font color="#0000ff">suddenly</font></i>, almost without warning. This sudden and intense onset of
      fever is sometimes duplicated in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> cases, but there is
      helminthiasis in connection with it. Child is well one minute and sick the next, and one very
      characteristic symptom in these cases is, the child is very hot, with red face and
      semi-stupor, but every little while starts or <i><font color="#0000ff">jumps in sleep as if it
      might go into spasms</font></i>. This condition is often found in children and then <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> is like "oil upon troubled waters." Remember <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> inflammations localize more than they do in <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>. I drew the difference between these two remedies in
      inflammations and inflammatory fevers when writing upon <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>.
      There is no use of confounding them. Some do so; but, in so doing, only exhibit their
      ignorance.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are, in every remedy, symptoms of sensation, circumstance,
      constitution or modality which are peculiar both to diseases and remedies. These symptoms are
      not always easily accounted for. The attempt to explain them from a pathological standpoint is
      not always possible or even necessary were it possible. A simple acceptance of them as facts
      is often more sensible than to wait long to find the often unfindable. To act as a prescriber
      upon what we know is better than waiting, because we cannot explain or account for it. For
      instance, it is not easy to tell why "the pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna
      appear suddenly and after a time disappear as suddenly as they come</font></i>," while
      those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> "<i><font color="#0000ff">gradually
      increase to a great height and as gradually decline</font></i>," or <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i> "<i><font color="#0000ff">begin slowly and
      decline suddenly</font></i>," or "<i><font color="#0000ff">gradually increase and
      suddenly cease</font></i>" but so it is, and the acceptance of these facts enables the
      homœopathic prescriber to cure his patient, whether he can explain them or not. Guernsey says
      -"This medicine is particularly applicable, and in fact takes the lead over all others in
      cases in which <i><font color="#0000ff">quickness</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">suddenness</font></i>
      of either <i><font color="#0000ff">sensation or motion</font></i> is predominant." To be
      sure all these symptoms have their pathological explanation if we could give it; but, acting
      on our law of <i><font color="#0000ff">Similia</font></i>, we can cure our patients and are
      not left at sea, without chart or compass, because we cannot explain. We know that these
      symptoms are the natural outcry of the pathological state, and that the administration of a
      poison which is capable of setting up a similar outcry cures the patient. What else is
      necessary? Either this is true, or Homœopathy is a humbug.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The simple fact, abundantly proven, that the remedy having the symptoms
      corresponding to the symptoms of the patient, cures him, no matter what the pathology, where a
      cure is at all possible, is one of the greatest discoveries of scientific investigation. Long
      live the name of Hahnemann the discoverer.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">From out description thus far of this remedy you would expect it to be a
      good one for <i><font color="#0000ff">congestive headaches</font></i>, and so it is, and not
      only so, but for neuralgic headaches. Throbbing pains, with the already described evidence of
      congestion of blood to the head. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> headaches,
      whether congestive or neuralgic, are worse on <i><font color="#0000ff">stooping forward,
      bending downward, or lying down</font></i>, anything that takes the patient out of the
      perpendicular. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Worse on lying down</font></i>," in fact,
      seems to be a very reliable general characteristic. The elder Lippe once told me of a case of
      suspicious enlargement or swelling and pain of the breast of long standing, which, as he
      expressed it, seemed likely to prove a case for the surgeon (cancer), which was entirely cured
      by a few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>, to which he was guided by
      this symptom of the pains being so much worse on lying down. Since then I have observed and
      verified this symptom in many cases of different kinds. I will not stop to give all the
      symptoms that might be present in <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> headaches.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No remedy has greater affinity for the throat. The <i><font color="#0000ff">burning,
      dryness</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>), <i><font color="#0000ff">sense
      of constriction</font></i> (constant desire to swallow to relieve the sense of dryness, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lyssin</font></i>), with or without swelling of the palate and tonsils, is
      sometimes intense. I once witnessed a case of poisoning in which these symptoms were terribly
      distressing.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are two very characteristic symptoms in the abdominal region, viz.:
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">Tenderness of the abdomen, aggravated by the least jar, in
      walking, or stepping, or even the bed or chair, upon which she sits or lies</font></i>";
      and "<i><font color="#0000ff">pressure downward as if the contents of the abdomen would
      issue through the vulva, &lt; mornings</font></i>." This last symptom is found under
      other remedies, notably <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium tigrinum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> there is
      often associated with this pressure downward a pain in the back "<i><font color="#0000ff">as
      if it would break</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Starting and jumping,</font></i>"
      or "twitching in sleep," or on going to sleep is characteristic.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So also is "<i><font color="#0000ff">sleepy, but cannot sleep</font></i>,"
      and "<i><font color="#0000ff">moaning during sleep</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">With <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> the head likes wrapping
      up or covering, takes cold when it is uncovered or from cutting the hair (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>). (<i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>; can't bear
      hat on).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Uniform, smooth, shining, scarlet redness of the skin, so hot that it
      imparts a burning sensation to the hand of one who feels of it, is very characteristic (H. N.
      Guernsey).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Convulsions with other symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      are very frequently found under this remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have here endeavoured to give an outline of this great remedy. A volume
      might be profitably written upon its virtues. No one remedy would be more greatly missed than
      this, if it were to be expunged from our great Materia Medica, but we must leave it here and
      proceed to notice.</p>

      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">HYOSCYAMUS NIGER.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">High-grade delirium, similar to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>; alternating with low-grade, delirium, with
      stupor, equal to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>. Face pale.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Grasping at flocks, picking the bed clothes and subsultus tendinum.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Persistent cough, worse lying down, relieved on sitting up, especially in
      elderly people.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dementia senilis; fears imaginary things, being poisoned, etc.; sees
      persons and things that are not present; foolish laughter.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">General twitching of all the muscles of the body; in spasms or convulsions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mania often takes on the lascivious form. The patient uncovers and
      exposes himself, sings and talks amorously.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Fears being poisoned; Suspicious and jealous.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Constant staring at surrounding objects, self-forgetful (fevers). Pupils
      dilated; insensible; small objects seem very large. Sordes on teeth; grating the teeth.
      Alternates well with <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. (fevers).</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i> is as delirious as <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>,
      but the high grade of delirium alternates with the low. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      the violent form predominates, while the quiet or stupid form is the exception. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i> it is just the other way. The stupid muttering form
      predominates, with occasional outbreaks of the violent form. The face of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> patient is red, that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>
      pale and sunken. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i> patient is weak and the
      weakness increases. His violent outbreaks of delirium cannot keep up long on account of
      weakness. This is not so much so with either <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> or
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>
      patients may begin with the violent form or outbreaks of delirium, but they grow more mild and
      less frequent, and the low or stupid form increases until there is total unconsciousness; so
      much so that it sometimes becomes difficult to choose between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The case takes on typhoid symptoms fast. The tongue gets dry and unwieldy,
      the sensorium so cloudy that even if you can arouse the patient to answer questions correctly
      he immediately lapses right into stupor again. This unconscious condition may continue even
      with the eyes wide open, staring around the room, but seeing nothing but flocks, at which the
      patient reaches and grasps; <i><font color="#0000ff">picks the bed clothes</font></i>,
      indistinctly muttering, or not saying a word for hours. The teeth are covered with sordes; the
      lower jaw drops; stools and urine pass involuntarily; thus presenting the most complete
      picture of great prostration of mind and body. This is a picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>
      as we find it often in typhoid fever, or typhoid pneumonia (where it is the best remedy I know
      of), scarlatina and other diseases. It is a wonderful remedy, but not of wide range like <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i> is not only a great remedy in the acute affections of
      which we have written, but it is also one of the most useful in chronic manias. If acute
      delirium passes on into the settled form, called mania, this remedy is still one of our chief
      reliances. It is much oftener of use here than <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>.
      Again, if the mania comes on after an acute disease it is still one of our leading remedies.
      In these forms of mania there are certain very marked symptoms calling for its use, such as,
      the patient is very <b><font color="#ff0000">suspicious</font></b>; will not take the medicine
      because he thinks you are trying to <i><font color="#0000ff">poison</font></i> him, or thinks
      some plot is being laid against him. He is <i><font color="#0000ff">jealous</font></i> of
      others, or the first cause of the attack is jealousy. Again, the mania often takes on the <i><font color="#0000ff">lascivious</font></i> form.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient uncovers and exposes himself, sings and talks amorously. <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i> leads all the remedies for this form of mania.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient, like the one in acute delirium of this remedy, is liable to
      alternate between the mild and violent manifestations; at one time so mild and timorous as to
      hide away from every one, and again so violent that she will attack, beat, fight. scratch, and
      try to injure anyone within reach.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The Hyoscyamus maniac is generally weak, and so this remedy is found
      particularly adapted to mania consequent upon the <i><font color="#0000ff">infirmities of age</font></i>.
      Of course it is useful in all ages if indicated by the symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The nervous manifestations of this remedy are not confined to the cerebral
      symptoms; but seem to involve the whole system.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As H. N. Guernsey says: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Every muscle in the
      body twitches, from the eyes to the toes</font></i>." This is one of his chief
      indications for its use in convulsions, whether epileptic or not. The spasms are generally of
      the clonic, not the tonic order, as in <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Strychnia</font></i>. Nor are they so violent as those under <i><font color="#0000ff">Cicuta virosa</font></i>; but the <i><font color="#0000ff">general twitching</font></i>
      is characteristic in convulsions, as is the <i><font color="#0000ff">subsultus tendinum</font></i>
      in typhoids.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Hyoscyamus is very useful in a form of dry cough which is aggravated <i><font color="#0000ff">when lying down</font></i> and relieved by sitting up. Here, too, it is
      particularly useful in old people. I have already referred to its great usefulness in
      pneumonia. I wish to emphasize it, and believe it to be the leading remedy in the typhoid form
      of the disease. At least it has performed wonders for me.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is also very useful in scarlatina of the typhoid form, and is
      complementary to <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. in those cases. I never
      alternate the two, but if the depressed sensorium and delirium goes beyond the power of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> to control I suspend the <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>
      for a day or two and give <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>, which will so
      improve the case that <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> may again come into use and
      carry it to a successful termination. This is the only alternation I am even guilty of. It is
      like that of Hahnemann when he alternated <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> in fevers.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">The same state of mind and sensorium is found in chronic and acute manias.
      I have cured several such cases. One was a lady about thirty years of age, who was overheated
      in the sun, on an excursion. She was a member in good standing in the Presbyterian church, but
      imagined herself lost and called me in six mornings in succession to see her die. Lost, lost,
      lost, eternally lost, was her theme, begging minister, doctor and everybody to pray for, and
      with her. Talked night and day about it. I had to shut her up in her room alone for she would
      not sleep a wink or let anyone else.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">She imagined her head was as big as a bushel and had me examine her legs,
      which she insisted were as large as a church. After treating her several weeks with <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lach</font></i>., <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum carb</font></i>. and other remedies on the <b><font color="#ff0000">cause</font></b>
      as the basis of the prescription, without the least amelioration of her condition, I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>, which covered her <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i>,
      and in twenty-four hours every vestige of that mania was gone.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But for the encouragement I gave the husband that I could cure her she
      would have been sent to the Utica Asylum, where her friends had been advised to send her by
      the allopaths. I gave her the sixth dilution or potency.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">To Dr. Constantine Hering belongs the honor of introducing and developing
      the wonderful medicinal properties of this snake poison. If he had never done anything beside
      this for medicine, the world would owe him an everlasting debt of gratitude. It alone would
      immortalize him. All this, and more; notwithstanding, Chas. Hempel wrote in his first volume
      of Materia Medica: "In spite of every effort to the contrary, the conviction has
      gradually forced itself upon my mind that the pretended pathogenesis of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, which has emanated from Dr. Hering's otherwise meritorius
      and highly praiseworthy efforts, is a great delusion, and that with the exception of the
      poisonous effects with which this publication is abundantly mingled the balance of the
      symptoms are unreliable." Hempel modified his views somewhat, I think, in later editions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, it is interesting to note that in Allen's Encyclopædia of Pure
      Materia Medica, the verified, and especially the black-typed symptoms, almost all of them, are
      verifications of provings made with the 30th potency. It is also significant that the provings
      of Hahnemann's polycrest remedies, mostly made with the potencies, are among the most useful
      and reliable we have to-day. Some have sought to destroy confidence in the provings of all
      remedies which are made with the 30th potencies and upwards; not only that, but in their power
      to cure even when the provings were made with cruder preparations. With us, who know the value
      of these potencies, all such efforts only excite pity. But many who do not know are misled and
      prejudiced so as to never dare to test for themselves. To all such we say take no man's ipse
      dixit, but prove all things, "hold fast that which is true."</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> is a remedy of wide range of action. It has an
      alternate action on the mind and sensorium, that of excitation and depression. Illustrative of
      the former are the following symptoms: "Quick comprehension, mental activity with almost
      prophetic perception, ecstasy, a kind of trance. Exceptional loquacity, with rapid change of
      subjects; jumps abruptly from one idea to another." This kind of excitation may be found
      in acute chronic complaints; in the delirium of fevers, or in mania of a settled form. On the
      side of depression occur: "Weakness of memory; makes mistakes in writing; confusion as to
      time. Delirium at night; muttering; drowsy; red face; slow, difficult speech and dropped jaw.
      Feels extremely sad, depressed, unhappy and distressed in mind," and this condition is
      very apt to be worse on awaking in the morning, or indeed after any sleep, day or night.
      "Chronic complaints from depressing cause, like long-lasting grief or sorrow." This
      depressed side of the remedy may also be found in both acute and chronic complaints. Again
      these opposite conditions may be found alternating in the same person, and a notable fact is
      that the alternations are extreme. Of course the causes of these conditions of mind and
      sensorium are varied, but we will often find them in <i><font color="#0000ff">old topers</font></i>,
      subjects of <i><font color="#0000ff">broken-down constitution</font></i>, and in the troubles
      incident to the <i><font color="#0000ff">climacteric age</font></i>. Such cases are subject to
      sudden attacks of giving away of strength, fainting, vertigo from rush of blood to the head
      causing apoplectic seizure, or opposite symptoms arising from sudden anæmia of the brain. In
      short, the circulation in <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> subjects is very
      uncertain. This is what makes it so valuable in sudden flushes during the climacteric period.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Lachesis has some prominent head symptoms where no other remedy can take
      its place. It is one of our best remedies for sun headaches; of course it does not compare
      with <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> for the immediate effects of sunstroke, but
      does come in well after the first effects are overcome by that remedy. The patient is troubled
      with headache every time he is exposed to the sun's heat, and the trouble has become chronic (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nat. carb</font></i>.).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is another characteristic symptom, namely weight or <i><font color="#0000ff">pressure on the vertex</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus, Glonoine,
      Menyanthes</font></i>). This is found mostly in women suffering at the menopause, and coupled
      with it in such cases there is sometimes burning on the vertex. Sulphur has this symptom, but
      if it occurred at the menopause the remedy would oftener be found in <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>,
      unless, indeed, there were some marked psoric complications. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      has a variety of headaches, but I know of only two characteristics that have been of very much
      value to me in prescribing for them, namely, with then headache <i><font color="#0000ff">very
      pale face,</font></i> and the patient <i><font color="#0000ff">sleeps into the headache</font></i>;
      dreads to go to sleep because she awakens with such a distressing headache. These two are very
      valuable indications, otherwise I would expect to get my indications outside of the headache
      itself. "Headache extending into the nose, comes mostly in acute catarrh, especially when
      the discharge has been suppressed or stops after sleep. This kind of headache is often found
      in hay fever, with frequent and violent paroxysms of sneezing. Now if the hay fever paroxysms
      of sneezing are decidedly worse after sleeping, even in the daytime, Lachesis 2000th may stop
      the whole business for the season." Being an old hay fever subject myself, I am authority
      on that statement.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We now come to the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      on the alimentary tract; first the gums are often swollen and spongy, easily bleeding; when
      this is found <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> often follows <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> well. If the gums turn purple the indication is
      strengthened for <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>. One of the most characteristic
      symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> is found in the tongue, especially in
      diseases of a typhoid type; namely, <i><font color="#0000ff">puts the tongue out with great
      difficulty; it is very dry; trembles and catches under lower teeth</font></i>. The tongue
      trembles and is protruded with difficulty under <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>,
      but it is not so dry as in <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>. This is a sign of
      great weakness, but in <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> it occurs in the very
      beginning of the fever, while in <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> it comes later.
      There is bad odor from the mouth in <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, and it may
      be very dry throughout; or there may be an abundant accumulation of tenacious mucus. Here it
      again resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      is one of our best remedies for sore mouth in the last stage of consumption. This is sometimes
      a very distressing symptom, and relief for it is often very difficult to find. If <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> should relieve it, my experience has been that the
      patients are also greatly relieved in other ways; so much so, indeed, that they think that
      they are, after all, going to get well. This brings me to notice what I believe I have not
      spoken of before, that where a cure is no longer possible, and temporary relief is the only
      thing left, we have the best means of giving it in the homœopathically indicated remedy.
      Narcotics, counter irritants, so-called tonics, stimulants, etc., do not and cannot compare
      with the simillimum (if properly administered) in smoothing the pathway to the inevitable
      termination. Lachesis has won its chiefest laurels in affections of the throat.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Throat and neck sensitive to slightest
      touch, or external pressure (Sepia); everything about throat distresses, even the weight of
      the bed covers</font></i>." This is very characteristic. Another peculiarity is that
      empty swallowing, or swallowing of saliva or liquids, aggravates a great deal more than
      swallowing of solids. The pains in the throat run up into the ears. There is much mucus in
      fauces, with painful hawking. In tonsillitis and diphtheria, swelling of tonsils begins on
      left side and extends to the right (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>). The pains
      are aggravated by hot drinks (reverse, <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>). All
      these symptoms are peculiar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, and are all apt
      to be very much worse after sleep. In old quinsy subjects, where the trouble always began on
      the left side, I have often not only aborted the attack, but cured the predisposition thereto.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes the throat assumes a gangrenous appearance, but if the other
      indications are present it is an additional indication for its use. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      is always one of the first remedies to be thought of in any disease, when it seems inclined to
      spend its main force in the throat, such as <i><font color="#0000ff">typhoid fever, pneumonia,
      scarlatina</font></i>, etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If the <i><font color="#0000ff">skin turns purple or bluish</font></i>, as
      if mortification were impending, there is no remedy like it. Not only is <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> an unusually efficacious remedy for these acute throat
      troubles, but for those of a chronic form, and the same symptoms are present, even in
      syphilitic throat troubles. We have placed great stress upon the great sensitiveness of the
      throat to all touch or pressure; but this does not end it, for, as Lilienthal expresses it, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> is the <i><font color="#0000ff">great enemy of all
      constriction</font></i>. "The pit of stomach sore to the touch, or even to pressure of
      clothes." "Cannot bear any pressure about the hypochondria." In the abdomen
      there is "Painful distention, flatulence, which is very annoying, can bear no pressure;
      the surface nerves are sensitive." "Is obliged to wear clothes, especially about
      stomach, very loose; they cause uneasiness; even in bed, obliged to loosen and pull up night
      dress to avoid pressure; dare not lay the arm across the abdomen on account of pressure."
      "Uterus does not bear contact; has to be relieved of all pressure; frequently lifts the
      clothes; they cause an uneasiness in the abdomen, even with no tenderness." "Larynx
      sensitive to least touch, which causes suffocation and feeling of lump in the throat."
      "During heat, as of an orgasm of blood, he is obliged to loosen clothes about the neck;
      sensation as though they hindered the circulation of blood, with a kind of suffocative
      feeling. "Intolerance of tight neck bands." I could no better express the value of
      this symptom, or great modality of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis, aggravation from
      pressure or constrictions</font></i>, than by quoting entire from Guiding Symptoms the above.
      It does nor seem, after such an array of oft-verified symptoms, that more need be said to
      impress this upon the memory and confidence of any physician. Now, the why of this almost
      invariable aggravation from pressure of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> and
      almost as invariable amelioration from the same of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      I leave for those to explain who pretend to be able to do so. It is, however, another proof of
      the value of modalities.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> has some peculiar symptoms of stool and anus. There is
      an urging, or rather a pressing down, in the rectum, but it is worse when he attempts a stool;
      hurts so that he must desist. It feels as if the anus were closed. This is somewhat like the
      constant or rather frequent, though ineffectual, urging to stool of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i>; or like the painful constriction of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>,
      which either prevents stool, or follows after an incomplete and unsatisfactory one. Another
      marked symptom is that the stools are often <i><font color="#0000ff">very offensive</font></i>,
      whether formed or not. Then, under <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, we have hæmorrhages
      from the bowels, of decomposed blood, which occur mostly during the course of exhausting,
      acute diseases, like typhoid. Guernsey gave this: "Flakes of decomposed blood, having
      form and appearance of perfectly charred wheat straw, in larger or shorter flat pieces;
      portions more or less ground up." I have met such cases and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      was very efficacious, not only in changing the character of the stool, but bringing about
      general improvement, ultimating in perfect recovery.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is often of great use in that very common malady, hæmorrhoids;
      and here you have the constricted feeling, whether the piles are external or blind, and
      sometime a beating or throbbing, or as the patient will perhaps express it, a sensation of
      "little hammers" beating in the rectum. All these symptoms and many more show the
      affinity of this remedy for the anus and rectum, as they do also its power over disease of the
      whole alimentary tract.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is also one of our best remedies in diseases of the female generative
      organs. In the first place it is eminently an ovarian remedy, and seems to choose by
      preference the left ovary. It is of use in simple ovarian neuralgia, and from that to actual
      tumors or every cancer of the left ovary; or the trouble begins in the left and goes to right
      ovary. (Reverse, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>). But we may have neuralgia,
      swelling, induration, suppuration, tumors or cancer of one or both ovaries. Its action in
      uterine troubles is also very marked. Here is a condition, as expressed in Guiding Symptoms,
      that I have often verified during climaxis: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Pains in uterine
      region increase at times more and more till relieved by flow of blood from vagina; after a few
      hours or days, the same again, and so on</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In these cases you almost always have the intolerance of least contact or
      pressure over the uterine region so characteristic of this drug. The womb prolapses, is at
      times persistently congested, and obstinate uterine hæmorrhages repeatedly occur. There are
      hot flashes, hot vertex, pale face and fainting, uterine displacements of various kinds, and
      deranged capillary circulation, all so common in females at the menopause and especially
      hæmorrhages. (See also <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kreosote</font></i>). Probably there are not three remedies in the whole
      Materia Medica so often indicated in troubles connected with this period, as <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kreosote</font></i>,
      post-climacteric diseases). It is often of great use in cancer of either the breasts or
      uterus. In either case the cancer puts on a bluish or purplish appearance, and if open or
      fungoid bleeds easily, a dark, decomposed blood. In case of bleeding, the pains and suffering,
      as in the case of uterine hæmorrhage, are temporarily relieved by it. We would be greatly
      crippled in the treatment of these various ovarian and uterine troubles without <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The respiratory organs and chest also come under the influence of this
      drug. Paralysis of the vocal chords, causing loss of voice; <i><font color="#0000ff">larynx is
      sensitive to least touch</font></i>; it causes suffocation; it is one of our best remedies in
      desperate cases of croup, where the child gets worse in sleep; <i><font color="#0000ff">seems
      to sleep into it</font></i>. Spasm of the glottis; sensation of something running from neck to
      larynx, stopping the breath. It has great shortness of breath when walking, especially in old
      topers and in heart affections, when this condition is always the guide to its use. "<i><font color="#0000ff">The least thing coming near the mouth or nose interferes with breathing; tears
      off the collar or everything about the neck, throat or chest, because it suffocates</font></i>."
      Asthma with the same symptoms, has sudden flushes of heat or orgasm of blood; must loosen
      clothes to prevent suffocation; threatened paralysis of the heart or lungs; dry hacking cough,
      aggravated by touching throat or larynx, also <i><font color="#0000ff">cough during sleep</font></i>,
      without awakening or being conscious of it. Here it often cures very obstinate cases of cough
      after <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> has failed, which also has this symptom.
      For the short dry cough sympathetic with heart troubles, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      is often useful. Cough with pain in anus, or stitches in pile tumors. One of our best remedies
      in <i><font color="#0000ff">typhoid pneumonia</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">typhoid
      fever</font></i> with lung complications.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now look out for the <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> tongue in
      these cases. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> is also one of our most useful
      remedies in heart troubles, acute or chronic, the peculiar suffocation, cough and aggravation
      from constrictions being the guiding symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No remedy more profoundly impresses the nervous system than this. In the
      first place it causes trembling, not from fright or excitement, but from extreme weakness. In
      this it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>; both have great trembling of
      the tongue on trying to protrude it. With both remedies the whole body trembles; but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> she feels faint, as if she must sink right down. This
      great prostration is both mental and physical, and she does not improve from rest or sleep,
      but on the contrary <i><font color="#0000ff">is worse in the morning after sleeping</font></i>.
      With this prostration there are often pain or other troubles with the heart; nausea, pale face
      and vertigo. Now if this thing goes on the next stage supervenes and paralysis is the end of
      it. The paralysis is generally left-sided, as are the majority of complaints of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, which is pre-eminently a <i><font color="#0000ff">left-sided
      remedy</font></i>. This paralysis may come on as a result of apoplexy or cerebral exhaustion;
      if the latter, there is still great hope of a perfect cure by a judicious use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>. Of course if the lesion is too extensive in apoplexy, and
      the extravasation of blood too great, there is little hope; but some apparently most desperate
      cases do recover even then. It is recommended in epilepsy and locomotor ataxia, but I have
      never seen good effects from it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is, however, another place in which I have seen it accomplish much
      and that is in the languor, weariness and prostration from hot weather. The heat not only
      aches, but the whole body seems prostrated by <b><font color="#ff0000">sun heat</font></b>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Antim. crud., Gelsemium, Glonoine, Natrum Carb., Natrum m</font></i>.)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Worse after sleep, or rather the patient <i><font color="#0000ff">sleeps
      into an aggravation</font></i>, is a genuine characteristic of this remedy, no matter what the
      enemies of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> say of it. On this line there is one
      particular symptom to which I wish to call attention, i. e., "As soon as the patient
      falls asleep, the breathing stops." This is as Hering expresses it. I have oftener found
      it this way; the patient cannot go clear off into sleep, because just on the verge of it the
      breath stops and he wakens catching for breath. This is often found in heart troubles,
      functional or organic, and is very distressing. <i><font color="#0000ff">Grindelia robusta</font></i>
      has a similar symptom. (Also <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once had a case of very obstinate constipation in an old syphilitic case.
      He was at last taken with very severe attacks of colic. The pains seemed to extend all through
      the abdomen, and always came on at night. After trying various remedies until I was
      discouraged, for he "got no better fast," he let drop this expression, "Doctor,
      if I could only keep awake all the time, I would never have another attack." I looked
      askance at him. "I mean," said he, "that I sleep into the attack, and waken in
      it." I left a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> 200. He never had
      another attack of the pain, and his bowels became perfectly regular from that day and remained
      so. I could give more cases where this symptom has led me to the cure of ailments of different
      kinds. It is enough to say that I have no hesitation in adding my testimony to that of others
      as to the value of this symptom. I think I have said enough about the different symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> to indicate that it is one of the most useful remedies in
      typhoid fever. I will only add here that it is generally in the second or third week of the
      disease that it is found indicated. This is one of the differences between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>. For the trembling and weakness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> come early, and if recognized then <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> can abort the disease at once. Of course the sensorium,
      tongue, mouth, throat, abdominal and stool symptoms already spoken of, especially the sleep
      symptom, help to decide the choice between <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> and
      other remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now upon the tissues. We have swelling on all parts of the body, and one of
      the most characteristic conditions is the color of them. They are <i><font color="#0000ff">bluish</font></i>
      verging onto black. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Tarantula Cub., Anthracinum</font></i>). I never
      see a swelling of that color but <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> immediately
      comes to my mind, and then if I find that they cannot bear to have them <i><font color="#0000ff">touched</font></i>, they are so sensitive, even a poultice is unbearable,
      because it is so heavy, that settles it. I give <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      and am seldom disappointed. The blood decomposes, or, as is sometimes said, "breaks
      down," becomes uncoagulable. This often occurs in typhoid fever, and is of course very
      serious. The bleeding is easily started, and is very persistent. There seems to be a tendency
      to hæmorrhagic trouble, so we find <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> one of our
      best remedies in purpura hæmorrhagica. Ulcers and wounds bleed profusely; even "small
      wounds bleed much;" wounds easily become gangrenous. Here <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      is capable of doing great good. Cancers turned bluish or black, bleed much and often, and
      burn; blood appears in the urine in many affections, indicating its broken down condition.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We find ourselves drawn out to a greater length on this truly</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">remedy than we had anticipated when we began writing we have also found it
      a much more useful remedy than we had anticipated from our impressions of it when reading
      Charles Hempel (for whom we have great respect) in our studenthood. It wears well for those
      who use it in the 30th potency and upwards. Don't forget that <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      is preeminently a left-sided remedy, as <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> is a
      right-sided one. Left-sided paralysis, ovarian affections, throat troubles, lung troubles,
      headaches, etc., all make us think of this remedy first because of its positiveness in this
      respect. Of course, if the other symptoms were present in right-sided affections we would not
      hesitate to use it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> is often a remedy of great
      value in skin affections; in scarlatina maligna, black measles, erysipelas, smallpox,
      malignant boils, furuncles, carbuncles, chronic ulcers, bed sores; fungus hæmatodes, etc. In
      all these and many other affections appearing upon the surface, the characteristic dark blue
      color is present, or we need not expect much from this remedy. So far as stages of life and
      constitution are concerned, I have found it efficacious in all ages and temperaments. But
      Perhaps oftener indicated in thin than in fat people.</p>
      <p align="justify">Now we bid our old and tried friend an affectionate good-by for a time, and
      heartily recommend all who have not done so to seek his acquaintance.</p>
