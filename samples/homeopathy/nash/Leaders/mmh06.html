      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is a blood relative of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>,
      if serpent poisons may be called relatives, and according to the symptoms arising from the
      bite of the serpent it ought to be equally valuable as a curative, but it has not yet been
      found so. Why not? on referring to Allen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Encyclopædia</font></i>
      we find twenty-nine provers, poisonings and all, for <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>,
      and forty-five for <i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i>. Of course, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> has been longest in use; but has the difference in time
      been sufficient to account for the very great difference in utility? Another thing is
      noticeable; the provings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> were made mostly with
      potencies as high as the 30th, while those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i> are
      almost all with the lowest preparation or the crude poison from the bite of the serpent. Does
      this account for it?</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We also notice on referring to the same authority that all the most marked
      verifications are of symptoms produced by the provings of the 30th of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>.
      Does this indicate that <i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i> must be proven in the
      potencies to develop its most efficient powers? <i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i> has
      been found of very decided use in affections of the heart, especially weak heart (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, tired feeling); diphtheria, where there is impending
      heart failure or paralysis. Dyspnœa and prostration from weak heart, sympathetic cough in
      organic diseases with weak heart action. (Dry cough, sympathetic in heart affections, <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i>.) Palpitation and bad feeling in heart, &lt; walking. In
      these troubles, as well as in chronic weakness of heart, there is no doubt of the value of <i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i>. Constantly dwells on suicide like <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i>.
      But further than this I do not know of very many marked successes from its use. Nevertheless,
      I feel convinced that with further proving and investigation, along the same line as <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, it may rival if not outshine it.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is another snake poison which, although like <i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i>
      has been proven only in the low preparations, has a better clinical record. Yet it lacks the
      clear-cut indications of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>. It has shown enough,
      however, to indicate that it is a remedy of great value. It seems, so far, to have shown its
      greatest usefulness in diseases which result in a decomposition of the blood of such a
      character as to cause hæmorrhages from <i><font color="#0000ff">every outlet of the body</font></i>
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Acetic acid</font></i>); even the sweat is bloody. This occurs in
      the lower fevers of hot climates, such as the bilious remittent fevers, typhoids, and that
      dread scourge of tropical climates, yellow fever. It is also the chief remedy in diphtheria
      when the profuse epistaxis occurs which marks many cases of a malignant type. In hæmorrhages
      of the nose in an old man of broken down constitution, where none of the remedies usually
      applied did the least good, <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i> acted promptly and no
      doubt saved the man's life. This was a patient of my own, and, although he had frequent
      attacks before, he never had another after the <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i>.
      As would be expected with such a remedy, there is <i><font color="#0000ff">great prostration</font></i>
      at such bleedings. <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus is right-sided</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Malignant jaundice is set down as an indication for <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i>, but the yellowness of the skin, so characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i>, is after all, I imagine, more of hæmatic than hepatic
      origin; yet there may be an element of both, as hepatic troubles are so common in hot
      latitudes where <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i> has gained its greatest laurels.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i> richly deserves proving in the potencies in order to
      bring out its finer characteristics.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Complementary to <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy, like some others, finds its leading symptom in the character
      of its pains. It leads all the remedies for <b><font color="#ff0000">stitching pains</font></b>.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> stands next, but there is a very marked
      difference. The stitching pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> come on with
      every movement, and only exceptionally when quiet, while those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      carb</font></i>. come on independently of movement. Again, the stitching pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> are oftenest located in serous membranes, while those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. are found anywhere and everywhere, and in almost every
      tissue, <i><font color="#0000ff">even</font></i> to the teeth. One of the favorite localities,
      however, for this remedy is in the <i><font color="#0000ff">lower right chest</font></i>. This
      sharp stitching pain is likely to <i><font color="#0000ff">run right through to the back</font></i>.
      If in pneumonia or pleuro-pneumonia your <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> has
      failed when you thought it indicated, and further examination reveals that the stitching pains
      come on independently of the respiratory movement, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>.
      often helps, and follows well after <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>. Often the
      fact is, that <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. was all the time the remedy and
      ought to have been given first. Now, these stitching pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      carb</font></i>. are not by any means confined to the right chest, but we may find them in the
      left, especially in pleuro-pneumonia, peri- or endocarditis. Remember, also, <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius vivus</font></i> in these <i><font color="#0000ff">lower right-chest
      pains</font></i>. If there should be present at the same time sweat without relief, and the
      mercurial mouth and tongue, neither <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> nor <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. are "in it."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another kind of case in which this remedy has achieved signal success,
      being indicated by the stitching pains, is puerperal fever.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The pains are so sudden and so sharp as to make the patient cry out loudly,
      and then they are gone. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. has saved some
      desperate cases of this kind. But it makes no particular difference where the disease is
      located, if these stitching pains are present, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali card</font></i>
      should not be forgotten. We cannot too strongly emphasize this.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carbonicum</font></i> exerts a profound influence over the
      blood-making processes. The blood lacks red corpuscles. The patient is anæmic, with great
      debility, skin watery or milky white. This condition is often found with young ladies at the
      age of puberty. They do not seem to be able to menstruate because of the poor quality of blood
      and general weakness. They incline to bloat, particularly in face, around eyes and especially
      upper eyelids, and have much pain and weakness in the lumbar region as well as general
      weakness. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. is in such cases sometimes successful
      after <i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      have been wrongly prescribed.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This anæmic condition is also found at the menopause, and in old age, when
      the same dropsical tendencies appear, and the same <b><font color="#ff0000">characteristic
      bag-like swelling</font></b>, or rather bloating, in the <i><font color="#0000ff">upper
      eyelids appears</font></i>. In all these cases you will generally, or often, at least, find
      what is called "weak heart." The heart action is irregular or intermittent from very
      weakness in correspondence with the general muscular weakness. One of the characteristic
      symptoms which makes us think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. in these cases
      in the constant backache of such a nature that the patient feels all the time that the back
      and legs <b><font color="#ff0000">must give out</font></b>. she drops into a chair or throws
      herself on the bed completely exhausted. This aching often extends into the hips and down into
      the gluteal muscles. Patient sweats easily. Farrington says: "This particular sweat,
      backache and weakness as a combination is not found under any other remedy."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have already spoken of this remedy somewhat while writing of its
      stitching pains as an indication for its use in diseases of the chest, but I did not there do
      it full justice. It is not only a great remedy for pneumonia, pleurisy and heart troubles, as
      there spoken of, but goes much further and becomes very useful in incipient and even with
      advanced cases of phthisis pulmonalis. I have seen a case pronounced incurable by several old
      experienced and skillful physicians, Dr. T. L Brown among them, get well under a dose once in
      eight days of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. The disease was located mainly in
      the lower right lung, with profuse expectoration of matter of pus-like appearance, pulse 120,
      greatly emaciated, no appetite, and quite a large cavity in the lung. This man is still alive
      (twenty-five years later), hale and hearty. Such service from any remedy makes a man fall in
      love with it. There is a <i><font color="#0000ff">time</font></i> characteristic for this
      remedy which is very valuable in chest affections, viz, <i><font color="#0000ff">aggravation
      at</font></i> 3 A. M. It may be found in cough, consumption, hydrothorax, asthma, and dropsies
      attending heart disease The father-in-law of Dr. T.L. Brown, an anæmic old man, was
      apparently near his end with hydrothorax and general dropsy Dr Brown was a skillful
      Prescriber, but in this case had utterly failed to even relieve. In consultation with Dr.
      Sloan, after carefully reviewing the case, the fact appeared, through de daughter of the
      patient, who had been his nurse all the time, that all his symptoms were aggravated at 3 A. M.
      Now <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali Carb</font></i>. 200 was given, and with such miraculous
      results that in an incredibly short time the old man was well and never had a return of that
      trouble. He lived for several years after, and, finally, did nor die of dropsy at all. The day
      of miracles is not past yet. Hahnemannian Homœopathy performs them still.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I cannot persuade myself to have this remedy yet, although I have given its
      chief uses.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I must call attention still further, even at the risk of repearing
      somewhat, to some very important symptoms. In regard to the nervous system I have already
      spoken of the <i><font color="#0000ff">great debility</font></i> which I have called <i><font color="#0000ff">muscular debility</font></i>, but there is a weakened condition of the nerves
      which renders them very sensitive which is well described in the symptoms found in the Materia
      Medica. "Very easily frightened, shrieks abut imaginary appearances; <i><font color="#0000ff">cannot bear to be touched</font></i>; starts when touched ever so lightly,
      especially on the feet" these are valuable indication for <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      carb</font></i>. Then don't forget the "<i><font color="#0000ff">bag-like œdematous
      swelling in the upper eyelids</font></i>." It goes with many affections and is invaluable
      as a guiding symptom. "Sticking pain in the throat (pharynx), as if a fishbone were
      sticking in it" (see <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphur, Dolichos, Nitric acid</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Great sensitiveness of epigastric region, externally."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stomach distended, sensitive, feels as if it would burst."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Excessive flatulency, everything he eats or drinks appears to be
      converted into gas."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Fullness, heat and great distention in abdomen immediately after
      eating a little."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Abdomen distended with wind after eating."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All these stomach and abdomen symptoms indicate the value of this remedy in
      dyspeptic conditions. They make us think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis, China
      officinalis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium clavatum</font></i>, but
      remember <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. and that it is especially adapted to <i><font color="#0000ff">broken down, aged people who are anæmic</font></i>. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Sitting up, leaning forward</font></i>, relieves in chest affections."
      The patient is also aggravated by lying on the affected side. Don't forget this, for it may
      enable you to choose between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, which has the
      reverse.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now in what I hat written I do not pretend to have told all, and if I
      thought that any young physician would be led to rely alone upon this work of mine or be led
      away from thorough study of the Materia Medica instead of to it I would stop writing.</p>

      No remedy has this more prominently than this one. <i><font color="#0000ff">Hydrastis</font></i>
      comes near to it, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lyssin</font></i> may approach it when from the
      mouth or throat; also <i><font color="#0000ff">Iris versicolor</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich.</font></i> produces and cures this

      <p align="JUSTIFY">And the action of the drug does not stop here but goes on to the formation
      of tough membrane, on the same surfaces. Again it causes and cures ulcerations of the mucous
      membranes. These ulcers are peculiar, "<i><font color="#0000ff">deep as if cut with a
      punch, edges regular</font></i>." I remember one case of years ago in which such ulcers
      appeared in the throat of a woman. One had eaten up through the soft palate into the posterior
      nares, and the whole palate looked as though it would be destroyed by the ulcerative process
      if not speedily checked. The case had a syphilitic look to me and had been under the treatment
      of two old school physicians for a long time. I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich</font></i>.
      30th, and to say that I was astonished at the effect (for it was in my early practice) is
      putting it mildly, for the ulcers healed so rapidly, and her general condition, which was very
      bad, correspondingly improved, that it three weeks from that time she was well to all
      appearance and never had any return of the trouble afterwards, or for years, at least as long
      as I knew her. I forgot to state that she also had the stringy discharge, though not so
      profuse as I have often seen in other cases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once cured a dog that had a sore mouth and throat, from which the saliva
      hung in strings, and dragged on the ground as he staggered along. People who saw him said he
      was mad, but I think not, as he did not snap or bite or have suffocating spasms.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i> is one of our sheet anchors in the treatment of
      disease of the mucous membrane of the nose. Not only in inflammations of an acute character,
      which are attended with stringy discharges, but also of a chronic kind known as "chronic
      catarrh." In these cases the patient often complains of much pressure at the root of the
      nose (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta pulm</font></i>.), and especially if an habitual
      discharge becomes suddenly suppressed. <i><font color="#0000ff">Slugs and clinkers</font></i>
      form in the nose, which form again and again after removal. Sometimes there discharge tough
      green masses or hard plugs. This process of chronic inflammation may go on from bad to worse,
      until ulceration sets in to such an extent that the whole septum may ulcerate away. I have
      known a case in which the apparently "punched out" ulcers ate a hole right through
      the septum. This may be syphilitic or not. If in syphilitic cases the destructive process
      should attack the bones, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich</font></i>. may still be of use,
      thigh I should expect to be obliged to resort to <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum met</font></i>.
      or some more deeply acting remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have likewise found in those troublesome cases of chronic post-nasal
      catarrh, where the dropping back into the throat is stringy, or those crusty or pluggy
      formations occur, this to be a good remedy, and it has gained me some fast friends.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In its formation of membranes in the throat it is as positive as any other
      remedy, and when the membrane extends downward into the larynx, causing membranous croup, I
      believe no remedy excels it. I have with it cured many cases of diphtheritic croup, and of
      late years never give it below the 30th Potency, because abundant experience has convinced me
      that it does better than the low triturations.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i> has been of use in the treatment of stomach
      troubles. The vomiting is often of the ropy character, and here also, as in nose, mouth and
      throat, we may have formed "round ulcers" But short of actual ulceration we have a
      form of dyspepsia, in which this remedy is very useful. It is often found in drunkards,
      especially <i><font color="#0000ff">beer drunkards</font></i>. There is great weight in the
      stomach, fullness, a distress <i><font color="#0000ff">immediately after eating</font></i>
      (like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i>), but not like Nux vomica, which comes
      on two or three hours after, nor like <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>, which
      also comes on two or three hours after eating, and then the pain continues until he <i><font color="#0000ff">eats again, which relieves</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are two appearances of the tongue which may be present in conjunction
      with these stomach troubles; one is a yellow coating at the base (<i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius
      prot</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum phos</font></i>.), the other a dry smooth
      glazed or red cracked tongue. This latter tongue is found more often in connection with
      dysentery in which <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich</font></i>. has sometimes done good

      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is one kind of discharge which comes from mucous membranes of which I
      have not yet written, "jelly-like mucus." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe socotrina</font></i>).
      It may come from nose, posterior nares, vagina or anus. This is especially found in dysentery
      where the stools have by some other remedy changed from an appearance "like
      scrapings" to the jelly-like form. Of course leucorrhœas of both the ropy and jelly-like
      variety come under this remedy and many fine cures have resulted from its use. It is no less
      so in affections of the respiratory organs, in coughs, croup, bronchitis, asthma, and even in
      consumption. The chromic acid element in this combination of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali</font></i>
      seems responsible for the ropy mucus, as no other <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali</font></i> has
      it in any such degree.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are a few more points about this remedy that ought not to be omitted.
      The pains are peculiar. They appear in <b><font color="#ff0000">small spots</font></b>, which
      can be covered with the point of a finger. This is markedly so with the pains in the head. In
      sick headache often so. Farrington says: "There are quite a number of remedies having
      blind headache, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i> is the best of
      them." The blindness comes on before the headache; then, as the headache begins, the
      blindness disappears. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Iris versicolor</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.) Then the pain settles in a <b><font color="#ff0000">small
      spot</font></b>, and is very intense. Again, the pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      bichromicum</font></i> appear and disappear suddenly. This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>.
      Then, again, they fly from one place to another like <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>.
      There are five remedies having markedly wandering or erratic pains, viz.: <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum, Kali sulphuricum, Pulsatilla, Lac caninum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Manganum aceticum</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>
      does not stay as long in a place as <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> does, nor
      is there so much disposition to swell. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali sulphuricum</font></i> is
      most like <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> in all its symptoms (see Boericke
      &amp; Dewey's <i><font color="#0000ff">Twelve Tissue Remedies</font></i>). The <i><font color="#0000ff">Manganum</font></i> pains shift crosswise from joint to joint, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Lac caninum</font></i> alternates sides, being worse on one side one day and
      on the other the next, etc. Then, again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>
      alternates <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i>; for instance, rheumatic and
      dysenteric symptoms alternate. (Also, <i><font color="#0000ff">Abrotanum</font></i>). <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i> alternates back symptoms, with general mind and bodily
      symptoms.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i> is particularly adapted to fat, light-haired

      truly great remedy.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is one of the drugs so greatly abused by the old school that I confess
      to not having prescribed it much; in the first place, from my prejudice against it, and, in
      the second, because it never had so thorough a proving as did Kali carb. by Hahnemann.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is one condition of the respiratory organs in which I have found it
      of great value. When after a hard cold a long-continued cough is the consequence, or it may be
      after an attack of pneumonia. The patient seems as if running into consumption. There is
      profuse expectoration from low down, deep in the chest, as if it came from mid sternum, with
      pain through to between the shoulders (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichrom</font></i>.) (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>., lower right chest through to back), and there are
      exhausting night-sweats and great general weakness. I have repeatedly cured such cases where
      consumption seemed inevitable.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In the beginning of my practice I used to dissolve two to four grains of
      the crude salt in a four-ounce vial of water and direct to take a teaspoonful of this
      preparation three times a day, until it is half used, and then fill up with water and continue
      taking the same way until cured; filling up the vial every time it was half used. But several
      years ago, having a marked case of this description and feeling sure of my remedy, I gave it
      in the 200th potency as an experiment. This case also made fully as speedy a recovery as the
      others treated with the crude drug, so since then I often prescribe it in the potencies. There
      are two other remedies that may dispute the place with <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hyd</font></i>.
      in such cases, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanguinaria</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>. In all the expectoration is profuse and thick, but in <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> the matter tastes <i><font color="#0000ff">sweet</font></i>,
      in <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanguinaria</font></i> the breath and sputa are very <i><font color="#0000ff">fœtid</font></i>, even to the patient (also <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>), while in <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hyd</font></i>.
      it is <i><font color="#0000ff">salty</font></i> to the taste (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>).
      With <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hyd</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>
      the expectoration is often thick, green; not so much so with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanguinaria</font></i>.
      Sometimes with the <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hyd</font></i>. there is a frothy or
      soap-suds-like appearance of the sputa, but the heavy, green, salty expectoration seems to me
      to be more characteristic. The frothy expectoration is found in œdema of the lungs and may
      occur in Bright's disease. I have more than once gotten the reputation of curing consumption
      in such cases as I have been describing, and I don't know but I deserved it, at least I was
      never known to deny it.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroiodicum</font></i> as used by the old school is given either as a
      sort of specific against syphilis, or more often syphilis complicated by their abuse of
      mercury, or again as an <b><font color="#ff0000">alterative</font></b> in scrofulous
      affections, without much reason. Now, what is an alterative? Here is the definition: "A
      medicine which gradually induces a <b><font color="#ff0000">change</font></b> in the habit or
      constitution, and restores healthy functions without sensible evacuation." Isn't that
      rather sweeping? How is that for a school of medicine that claims to be the custodian of all
      medical science? Isn't that about what we would like to do in every case -<i><font color="#0000ff">restore healthy function</font></i>, without sensible evacuation? How would <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroiodicum</font></i> do then for a panacea? There are, however, many
      so-called alteratives according to this definition; which shall we give? It is just here that
      we homœopaths believe that such vague general terms as alterative, tonic, narcotic, etc., are
      too unmeaning for purposes of close prescribing, and therefore misleading. They allow the
      doctor to prescribe too loosely a <i><font color="#0000ff">class</font></i> of remedies,
      instead of the particular remedy of that class best adapted to the individual case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We claim, therefore, great superiority for our system of prescribing, which
      is based upon a system of close drug proving, which brings out the closest, finest shades of
      difference between remedies belonging to a class of remedies. There must be no substitution of
      one for the other, if we would do the finest prescribing possible.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It requires but little comparison between the Materia Medicas of the two
      schools to show the wide difference in this respect.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is said to be a place for the use of this remedy in pneumonia. I have
      not had experience with it here, but on account of its reputation I give it, and may use it if
      occasion requires.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I give you Farrington's words for it: "Pneumonia, in which disease it
      is an excellent remedy when hepatization has commenced, when the disease localizes itself, and
      infiltration begins. In such cases, in the absence of other symptoms calling distinctively for
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia, Phosphorus</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>,
      I would advise you to select <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodide of Potassa</font></i>. It is also called for when the hepatization is
      so extensive that we have cerebral congestion, or even an effusion into the brain as a result
      of this congestion." The symptoms are as follows in these cases:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"First they begin with a very red face, the pupils are more or less
      dilated, and the patient is drowsy; in fact, showing a picture very much like that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>. You will probably give that remedy, but it does no
      good. The patient becomes worse, breathes more heavy, and the pupils more inactive to the
      light, and you know then that you have serous effusion into the brain, which must be checked
      or the patient dies." So far good. But now even Farrington <i><font color="#0000ff">dulls</font></i>
      -as great men sometimes do. He says, "why did not <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      cure?" "He who prescribes by the <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i> alone
      in this case would fail, because he has not taken the totality of the case." What does
      Farrington mean? Does he mean that in his picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      he had the totality of the case without the hepatization, or does he mean that the
      hepatization was the totality without the other symptoms? Here are the two horns of his
      dilemma -which would he take? I contend that all the other symptoms of the case, without the
      hepatization, was not the totality of the case. The hepatization was one, and only one, of the
      totality of symptoms. Now he says -"Put your ear to the patient's chest, and you will
      find one or both lungs consolidated." Well, I should call that a very important <i><font color="#0000ff">objective</font></i> symptom, and one that could not be left out of the <i><font color="#0000ff">totality</font></i> of the case. Remember that both subjective and objective
      symptoms must enter into every case in order to make the totality complete.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So after all, in true Hahnemannian fashion, I claim that he who prescribes,
      being guided by <i><font color="#0000ff">all the symptoms</font></i>, will not and cannot fail
      where a cure is at all possible. These are and must be our infallible guides, or <i><font color="#0000ff">Similia Similibus Curantur</font></i> is not true. (see Kafka's case, Hom.
      Clinic, page 73, 1870).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Guiding Symptoms, Vol. VI, page 441, records this -"Distends all the
      tissues by interstitial infiltration; œdema, enlarged glands, tophis exostoses; swelling of
      the bones." Then of course it cures such distentions of the tissues. Great mistakes and
      abuses of the remedy, and irreparable injury to the patient, often follow the use of remedies
      on such vague or single indications, that is of course if we prescribe on them alone. That
      would be like trying to prescribe for pneumonia from the single indication <i><font color="#0000ff">hepatization</font></i>. This is only one symptom, and that one may occur
      under any remedies. If we say, or could say, interstitial distention of the tissues with
      certain other symptoms peculiar to that remedy, then could we differentiate between it and
      other remedies. But to use a remedy simply as an absorbent because it has secured absorption
      in some other case, is simply to fall back into the indiscriminate generalization and
      routinism of the old school. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali iodatum</font></i> is called an
      anti-syphilitic. So is mercury. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> is called
      anti-psoric, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> antisycotic. That is well to begin
      with, but the "end is not yet." There is a large class of remedies for each of these
      miasms and <i><font color="#0000ff">the one</font></i> (indicated by all the symptoms or the
      characteristic symptoms) <i><font color="#0000ff">out of the class</font></i> is the one to
      select for the cure of each individual patient.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The very fact that <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali iodatum</font></i> has
      been too generally and indiscriminately used is the reason why it is a great question as to
      whether humanity has been most blessed or cursed by it. We homœopaths have much to do in
      combating the evils produced by the abuse of both these drugs, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar
      sulphur</font></i>, is <i><font color="#0000ff">one</font></i> of the best antidotes. Most of
      the reported cures with this remedy <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali iod</font></i>. are made
      with the low or crude preparations of the drug. I think it can be used lower than most drugs
      without injury, and yet I believe we do not know half its remedial power as developed by our
      process of potentization.</p>

      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">KALI MURIATICUM.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="justify">Is one of the so-called "Bio-chemic" remedies, or one of the
      twelve tissue remedies, claimed by Schuessler to be able to cure all the ills that flesh is
      heir to. It has not been proven enough to know half its real value. Clinical use in the
      potencies, ranging from the 3d to the 30th, has proven. that it is a remedy of undoubted great
      value. It is of use in the second stage of inflammations or the stage of interstitial
      exudation in any part of the body, and here it is not, so far as yet known, attended with the
      danger of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroiodicum</font></i>. If it had been used in the
      massive doses of the latter remedy, we might have had more deleterious results than we now
      know of. I have seen enlarged joints after acute rheumatism rapidly reduced to normal size
      under its action, sometimes after they had resisted other remedies a long time; but I do not
      know of any characteristic symptoms for its use in preference to other remedies. It is also a
      remedy for tonsillitis after the acute inflammatory symptoms have been checked by <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Belladonna</font></i>, or <i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum phos</font></i>.
      I have found it very efficacious in deafness from inflammation and closure of the Eustachian
      tube. I began using it in the 3d or 6th, but have better success with the 24th potency. A
      great many cases of chronic incurable deafness might have been cured by this remedy if used
      early. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius dulcis</font></i> may be mentioned in this
      connection, as it was not when we wrote of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercuries</font></i>,
      as another remedy for these Eustachian troubles. Of course you would be apt to have some other
      mercurial symptoms which would perhaps enable you to choose between the two remedies. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali mur</font></i>. is likely to come into use more from a clinical
      introduction than from provings. That is what Hering used to call a remedy born by breech
      presentation. It is possible, but not right or natural.</p>
