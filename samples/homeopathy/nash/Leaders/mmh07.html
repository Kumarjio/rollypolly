      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It seems to me that in this remedy also the leading characteristic is to be
      found in its sensation-<i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>, <b><font color="#ff0000">stinging</font></b>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">pains</font></i>. They are sharp and quick, like the sting of the
      bee. These pains are as characteristic of this remedy as are the <i><font color="#0000ff">itching-like
      chilblains of Agaricus</font></i>, or the burnings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>; but the burning of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
      are relieved by cold, while those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i> are relieved
      by heat. The stinging appears in many diseases, and kinds of tissue. In the serous membranes
      or the brain coverings, when we get those "shrill, sudden piercing
      screams"-"cri cerebrale," which attend such dangerous affections as
      hydrocephalus, cerebro-spinal meningitis and typhus cerebralis, <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
      is the remedy. Again we get these pains in the mucous membranes, as in the throat and hæmorrhoids,
      and the burning is almost always more or less present at the same time. It is also found very
      prominent in the ovaries. It has proved a very valuable remedy in cancers, even open ones,
      when this stinging, burning pain was present; also in panaritium. I have seen rapid cures
      follow its exhibition in felon. Hering put it -"<i><font color="#0000ff">redness and
      swelling with stinging and burning pain in the eyes, eyelids, ears, face, lips, tongue,
      throat, anus, testicles</font></i>." (&gt; by cold applications ought to be added).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So we see how generally the system comes under the action of this remedy.
      In skin affections, especially the acute exanthems, this is the grand leading symptom, and is
      especially indicated in affections of the brain and meninges caused by a sudden suppression of
      skin diseases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The next general condition for which this remedy seems to be as near
      specific as any remedy can be is an infiltrated cellular tissue; and œdematous or dropsical
      condition. This condition obtains almost from the beginning of inflammatory affections and
      extends to the stage of exudation, and even to chronic dropsical states. In those intensely
      violent and rapid cases of diphtheria in which the whole throat fills right up with œdematous
      swelling, the vulva hanging down like a transparent sac filed with water (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum, Rhus toxicod</font></i>.), and the patient is in imminent
      danger of death by suffocation from actual closure of the throat and larynx, there is no
      remedy like <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>. The stinging, burning pains may be
      present in these cases; or what is <b><font color="#ff0000">more</font></b> dangerous still,
      because there is no complaint until the case is far advanced, is an <i><font color="#0000ff">absolutely
      painless</font></i> condition, <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> has painlessness
      in throat affections, but the swelling is not so rapid as <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>,
      and there is no œdema. A number of years ago I was called to Watkins Glen, N. Y., in
      consultation in a very bad case of diphtheria. One had already died in the family and four lay
      dead in the place that day. Over forty cases had died in the place and there was an exodus
      going on for fair. Her attending physician, a noble, white-haired old man, and withal a good
      and able man, said, when I looked up to him and remarked I was rather young to counsel him:
      "Doctor, I am on my knees to anybody, for every case has died that has been
      attacked." The patient was two rooms away from us, but I could hear her difficult
      breathing even then. <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> was comparatively a new remedy
      then for that disease, but as I looked into her throat I saw <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
      in a moment, and a few questions confirmed it. I told the doctor what I thought and asked him
      if he had tried it. He said, no he had not thought of it, but it was a <i><font color="#0000ff">powerful blood poison</font></i>; try it. It cured the case, and not one case
      that took this remedy from the beginning, and persistently, died. It was the remedy for the <i><font color="#0000ff">genus epidemicus</font></i>. See my report of this in Vol. XII, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hahnemannian Monthly</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This œdematous condition of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> may
      be found in almost any part of the body, but is especially prominent in mouth and throat,
      eyelids and face, <i><font color="#0000ff">around</font></i> the eyes (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>, whole Face); lower lids hang down like bags of water. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>., upper lids). In erysipelas the swelling of the skin is
      of this œdematous appearance, and generally with stinging pains.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes the œdema increases until it forms large blister-like bags of
      water.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The dropsical effusion may be general or local. It is found in the thoracic
      cavity, in ovaries, in abdominal cavity, scrotum, and genitals of females. One peculiar
      symptoms which helps to choose between it and other remedies in dropsy is the almost absolute <i><font color="#0000ff">absence of thirst</font></i> (with thirst, <i><font color="#0000ff">Acetic
      acid, Arsenic</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Apocynum</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I will now, in addition to what I have written, call attention to some
      particular affections and symptoms in which <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> should be
      remembered. A very important symptom not yet mentioned is <i><font color="#0000ff">tenderness
      or sensitiveness</font></i> <i><font color="#0000ff">to touch</font></i>, as if bruised. This
      is particularly true in the abdominal, uterine, and ovarian regions, but is not by any means
      confined there, for we may find the whole surface of the body exceedingly sensitive to touch:
      even the hair seems sore (<i><font color="#0000ff">China officinalis</font></i>). The
      condition is often found in cerebro-spinal meningitis and is a strong indication for <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>. In erysipelas this tenderness is often present, and is found
      under <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphur</font></i>, as well as <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The sleep of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> is either very
      restless, or in brain diseases there is <i><font color="#0000ff">deep stupor</font></i>,
      interrupted occasionally by <i><font color="#0000ff">piercing screams</font></i>. Never forget
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> then. In all inflammatory affections and in
      intermittent fevers, if you find the patient <i><font color="#0000ff">alternately dry and hot,
      or perspiring</font></i>, think again of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No remedy has this alternation so strong as <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Sensation as if every breath would be his last</font></i> is very
      characteristic, and occurs not only in dropsical troubles of the chest, but seems also to be a
      nervous symptom. In scarlatina <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> is especially
      indicated if the eruption is retarded or retrocedent and serious brain troubles result, and it
      is no less efficacious in post-scarlatinal dropsies if the symptoms do not indicate some other
      remedies.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">If I were to select the one remedy with which to prove the truth of the
      formula similia, etc., I think this would be the one. There is no remedy that so surely, and
      so violently, irritates and inflames the urinary organs, and no remedy so promptly cures such
      irritation when it puts on, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> type or form,
      which it often does.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">H N. Guernsey wrote: "It is a singular fact, though known to most
      practitioners, that there be frequent micturition attended with burning, cutting pain, or if
      not so frequent and the cutting, burning pain attends the flow, <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>
      is almost always the remedy for whatever other suffering where may be, even in inflammation of
      the brain or lungs." He might have added in the throat, and mucous membranes all through
      the intestinal tract, even to the rectum and anus, and in the pleura or on the skin.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">He also wrote: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> should
      always be remembered and studied in treating affections of the air passages when the mucus is
      tenacious." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Hydrastis, Kali bichrom. Coccus cacti</font></i>,
      etc.) I had the pleasure of verifying the truth of this in the case of a lady who had suffered
      a long time with bronchitis.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mucus was so profuse, and tenacious, and ropy, that I thought of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>, and thought it must be the remedy; but it did not
      even ameliorate, and she got worse all the time, until one day she mentioned that she had
      great cutting and burning on urinating, which she must do very frequently.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">On the strength of the urinary symptom, for I knew nothing of its curative
      powers on the respiratory organs at that time, I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>.
      The effect was magical.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is needless to describe the mutual delight of both physician and patient
      in such a case, for it was astonishing the rapidity with which the perfect and permanent cure
      of the case was accomplished.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Let us notice still further the effects of this remedy upon the urinary
      organs by calling attention to a few symptoms that have been both produced in proving and
      cured <i><font color="#0000ff">ab usu in morbis</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have learned to place the <i><font color="#0000ff">highest estimate</font></i>
      upon such symptoms. To be sure there are many symptoms in our great Materia Medica that have
      come to us through clinical sources only, and very valuable ones, too. But they cannot be
      received with such implicit confidence on short acquaintance as those that are both
      pathogenetic and clinical. They should always be separated when possible, as they were in
      "Hull's Jahr" of old. Here are a few of them. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Violent
      pains in bladder, with frequent urging to urinates with intolerable tenesmus."
      "Violent burning cutting pains in the neck of the bladder." "Before, during and
      after urinating fearful cutting pains in the urethra" "Constant urging to urinate;
      urine passed drop by drop with extreme pain." "Urine scalds him; it is passed drop
      by drop</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No homœopathist meeting these symptoms in a case would fail to think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> at once, no matter what else ailed the patient, as it has
      cured the most diverse and varied diseases when occurring in conjunction with these urinary
      symptoms. How any physician of any school can deny the truth of <i><font color="#0000ff">similia
      similibus curantur</font></i> in the light of such testimony of proof can only be accounted
      for on the principle of "none so blind as those who will not see."</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> has also very decided action upon the skin. In
      erysipelas it is sometimes the best remedy, and choice has to be made between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>, which also sometimes has <i><font color="#0000ff">great
      urinary irritation</font></i> in such cases. In the <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
      cases there is apt to be more <i><font color="#0000ff">œdema</font></i>; in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> more <i><font color="#0000ff">blistering</font></i>. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> the <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> is more
      intense than under the <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>, while in the latter there is
      more <i><font color="#0000ff">stinging</font></i>. The urinary symptoms, if present, are very
      much more intense under <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>.- Again, the mind
      symptoms of the two remedies are quite different. In the <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
      cases, aside from the stinging pains which make the patient cry out sharply at times,
      especially if the eruption inclines to "go in" and attack the membranes of the
      brain, the patient may not be so very restless and complaining; but in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> case the patient is uneasy, restless, dissatisfied,
      distressed, sometimes moaning or violently crying; wants to be moved about constantly. The
      mind symptoms actually make one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum album</font></i>,
      and when we take into account the intense burning it is doubly so. So that it would be very
      easy to get confused between these two remedies, as well as <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>. If great thirst is also present it would make us
      think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>, And now we are upon the skin, <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> is a great remedy for burns, both locally as an
      application and internally for the more chronic conditions and sequelæ. In all skin troubles
      where blebs or watery vesicles form, which burn and itch, or when touched burn and smart, we
      do well to remember <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>, and look further to find
      more symptoms, if present, to corroborate it. Hering used to challenge skeptics to burn their
      fingers, and then cure them by dipping the fingers into water medicated with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>. So great was his faith in it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I will call attention to a sensational symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>
      which I believe is underestimated in practice. It is the sensation of <b><font color="#ff0000">Burning</font></b>.
      If any remedy deserves to be placed alongside <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
      for burning it is this one. I will quote so as to bring all together, in a way to impress upon
      our memory the burnings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>. "Inflammation
      of the eyes particularly when caused by a <i><font color="#0000ff">burn</font></i>."
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">Burning</font></i> in mouth, throat, and stomach." Great
      thirst, with <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> pain in throat and stomach.
      "Violent <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> pain in stomach in region of
      pylorus." "Violent <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> pain and heat through
      whole intestinal tract." "Passage of white or pale-red tough mucus with the stool
      like scrapings from intestines, with streaks of blood; after stool colic relieved, <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>, biting, and stinging in the anus." "Great <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> pain in the ovarian regions." "Peritonitis with <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> pain, abdomen sensitive and tenesmus of the bladder."
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">Burning</font></i> and stinging of the larynx, especially when
      attempting to hawk up tough mucus." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Burning</font></i> in
      the chest."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We have already spoken of the <i><font color="#0000ff">burnings</font></i>
      connected with affections of the urinary organs, and also of the <i><font color="#0000ff">burnings</font></i>
      of the skin in erysipelas and other eruptions upon the surface.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This seems to me to be sufficient to impress upon the reader the value of
      this symptom belonging to this remedy. I will close by calling attention to its effect upon
      the membranes to <i><font color="#0000ff">increase their secretion</font></i>. This action is
      positive and is a valuable indication for its use.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This spider poison has like other spider poisons very positive nervous
      symptoms. It acts upon the uterus and ovaries, and upon the female sexual organs generally.
      "In case of hyperæstesia or congestion of these organs, which set up a general
      hysterical condition, states simulating spinal neurasthenia, sensitive and painful back;
      excessive restlessness, and impressibility to excitements, music, especially, where there is
      constant inclination to keep the hands busy (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bromatum</font></i>),
      and again especially if accompanied by sexual desire or pruritus of the genitals, <i><font color="#0000ff">Tarantula</font></i> is able to accomplish much." Choreaic conditions,
      which are often the outcome of an advanced stage of the above described nervous condition, are
      peculiarly amenable to this remedy. Twitching or jerking of the muscles in conjunction with
      other troubles should always call to mind this remedy, with which such jerkings are so
      characteristic. It has a restlessness in women similar to the restlessness in men of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>, viz., cannot keep quiet in any position; must keep in
      motion, though walking &lt; all the symptoms. This remedy is not yet as thoroughly understood
      as it should be. Another spider ought to be mentioned in this connection, viz., the <i><font color="#0000ff">Tarentula cubensis</font></i>.</p>

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Theridion curassavicum</font></i> is another spider poison proven by
      Hering. There is one peculiar and characteristic symptom under this remedy, which has been
      verified by myself and others -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Vertigo with nausea especially
      on closing the eyes</font></i>." Allen puts it -vertigo <b><font color="#ff0000">on
      closing the eyes</font></b> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lach., Thuja</font></i>), on opening
      them, <i><font color="#0000ff">Tabacum</font></i>; on looking upward (<i><font color="#0000ff">Puls.,
      Sil</font></i>.) <b><font color="#ff0000">from any even least noise</font></b>; aural or
      labyrinthine (Menière's disease).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again "<b><font color="#ff0000">every sound seems to penetrate through
      the whole body, causing nausea and vertigo</font></b>" <i><font color="#0000ff">Asarum</font></i>
      has a somewhat similar symptom which is worth remembering. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Over-Sensitiveness
      of nerves</font></i>, <b><font color="#ff0000">scratching of linen or silk</font></b>,
      crackling of paper is unbearable." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ferr., Tarax</font></i>.)
      The vertigo occurs in different affections of the head or stomach, and cures the whole trouble
      when it is present. It seems like a small thing to "go by," but no smaller than
      "vertigo, worse on lying down, and turning the head" (<i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i>),
      or "vertigo on looking upward" (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea, Pulsatilla</font></i>)
      and many other symptoms of other remedies which have been verified many times. Another symptom
      which seems to be very valuable in chest affections is, "<i><font color="#0000ff">pains
      run through upper left chest to shoulder</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phthisis
      florida</font></i> has been cured on this symptom for a guide, if given early.) This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Myrtus communis</font></i>, with which I have helped many cases having that
      peculiar local symptom. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur, Pix liquida</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Anisum stellatum</font></i> also have it.) Dr. Baruch says: "In rachitis,
      caries and necrosis it apparently goes to the root of the evil and destroys the cause."</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">We now leave the spider family, but as we are dealing with small fry of the
      insect order we will notice the <i><font color="#0000ff">Coccus cacti</font></i>, a small bug
      or insect which infests the plants of the cactus species of Mexico and Central America. It has
      made its best record in curing affections of the respiratory organs.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Whooping cough with expectoration of much tough, ropy white mucus. This
      mucus comes in large quantities and is often accompanied with gagging and vomiting, which
      seems to expel the mucus from the stomach. Sometimes a bronchial catarrh remains after
      whooping cough, which has this kind of expectoration. Here this remedy will sometimes clear up
      the whole case. This is all I know of its virtues <i><font color="#0000ff">ab usu in morbis</font></i>.
      Now we come to a little pest of womankind all over.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is another animal remedy often found valuable in whooping cough. With this
      remedy the aggravations generally come on in the after part of the night or in the morning
      when the child awakens. The paroxysms are not confined to this time, but the worst one comes
      then. The paroxysm ends in vomiting of clear <i><font color="#0000ff">ropy mucus</font></i> in
      large quantities, hanging in long strings from the mouth. For such a cough <i><font color="#0000ff">Coccus cacti</font></i> is <i><font color="#0000ff">excellent</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has one characteristic symptom which has been verified. "Sensation
      as if the tendons were too short." There is sometimes actual contraction as if the legs
      cannot be stretched out. This has been verified in intermittent fevers, and only the other day
      (a short time ago) Dr. Brewster, of Syracuse, told of a case in which he was guided by this
      symptom.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A man was driving a fractious horse that started to run away with him.
      Thinking to give him enough of it he let the horse run, and when tired of running whipped him
      into running more until he had run him up a hill several miles long. The road over which he
      passed was very rough, and the man was so bruised and sprained about the buttocks and legs
      that he was confined to the house for a long time in consequence. It finally settled into what
      seemed likely to be a permanent contraction of the tendons of the lower limbs. No remedy
      relieved, until the good doctor bethought him of a case of intermittent fever which he had
      cured twenty years before, being guided by this symptom. He gave the patient a dose of
      Jenichen's 600th potency of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cimex</font></i>, with immediate result,
      and cure of the case. "Honor to whom honor is due," even if it be a bed-bug.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Charles J. Hempel called this "the catnip of Homœopathy,"
      because it was particularly adapted to nervous affections, especially of children. This is one
      of the remedies that finds its leading characteristic symptoms in the <i><font color="#0000ff">mind</font></i>
      of the patient. To "boil down" all the different ways in which the <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> mind can be and is expressed: "<i><font color="#0000ff">The patient is cross, ugly, spiteful, snappish</font></i>. She knows it,
      admits it, and so does every one else. She will return mean, uncivil, spiteful answers to her
      best friends, and then confess her fault, to repeat it again and again, and stoutly affirms
      she cannot help it, she feels so." This state of mind is always present in the marked <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> case, whether it be adult or child.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course the young child cannot give vent to its feelings by talking, so
      it comes as near to it as it can by whining and crying, sometimes it seems without cause, and
      also when it shows by fever, diarrhœa, teething and many other complaints that it is actually
      sick and suffering. It wants this or that thing, puts out its little hand for it, and when it
      is offered pushes it away and points to something else, to reject it in turn. Now the child
      does not know what it wants, but the homœopathic physician does. It wants a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>. This peevish disposition in which nothing pleases,
      takes possession of the child, mother, father or any and all grades and classes of subjects
      when <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> is the remedy, and it is found in
      connection with all kinds of diseases. It is also especially adapted for ailments <i><font color="#0000ff">brought on</font></i> by fits of anger. In short, it is the leading <i><font color="#0000ff">anger remedy</font></i> of the Materia Medica.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The other leading anger remedies, or, for ailments brought on by anger, are
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Bryonia, Colocynth, Ignatia, Lycopodium, Nux vomica,
      Staphisagria</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is also one of the leading remedies for <b><font color="#ff0000">pain</font></b>,
      and there is this peculiarity about it, the pain is not always in proportion to the gravity of
      the case, and we often see, for instance, in labor, a great deal harder pains of which the
      patient does not complain half so loudly. But in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>
      case the patient is exceedingly sensitive to the pain and exclaims continually, "Oh; I
      cannot bear the pain." Many times have I met this condition in labor cases, and in the
      majority of them the cross, peevish, snappish, condition of mind accompanying, and seen it
      changed in a short time to a mild, uncomplaining, patient state, by a single dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> 200th.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This sensitiveness to pain is not confined to labor cases, but I have often
      observed it in neuralgias, toothache, rheumatism, etc., and the same happy results follows its
      use.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This condition of sensitiveness is often found in coffee drinkers, or in
      those who have been addicted to narcotics.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> is very useful here. There is another sensation which
      is often found in conjunction with, or sometimes alternating with, this pain or sensitiveness,
      and that <b><font color="#ff0000">numbness</font></b>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is found in rheumatism or paralytic states and is very characteristic.
      The pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> are oftener aggravated by heat
      than otherwise, but are not on the other hand, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>,
      ameliorated by cold. In fact, the patient is often very sensitive to cold, and cold air brings
      on troubles for which this remedy is specific. I now call to mind a very painful case of
      rheumatism of the left shoulder in a middle-aged man. It was in my earlier practice, when I
      was prescribing for names more than I do now, and of course he got <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite,
      Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i>, etc., but no
      relief. A wiser man was called in consultation and the patient was quickly cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>. When I asked the counsel what led him to prescribe this
      remedy he answered <i><font color="#0000ff">numbness with the pains</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another condition which is met by this remedy is <i><font color="#0000ff">restlessness</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">sleeplessness</font></i>. You will remember that we gave as the
      great trio of restless remedies <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Arsenicum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i> That was right, but we did not say that those were all the
      restless remedies. Here we have another in <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>. Let
      me quote: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Violent rheumatic pains drive him out of bed at
      night, and compel him to walk about</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox.,
      Ferrum met., Verat. alb</font></i>) "<i><font color="#0000ff">Excessive uneasiness,
      anxiety, agonized tossing about, with tearing pains in the abdomen</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">The child can only be quieted by carrying it on the arms will not be quiet
      unless carried</font></i>." (Opposite <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>). These
      symptoms represent in a few words the restlessness of this remedy. But some will ask, isn't
      this similar to your <i><font color="#0000ff">trio</font></i> of restless remedies? It is; but
      there are shades of difference and concomitant symptoms that decide between them all. And the
      true Hahnemannian is the man to recognize them. There is no particular overwhelming fear, fear
      of death, etc., under <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> as there is under <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>. The patient is maddened; driven to desperation under <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>; does not care whether she dies or not; had <i><font color="#0000ff">rather</font></i> die than <i><font color="#0000ff">suffer so</font></i>, and
      so we might draw lines of differentiation between this and other restless remedies, but it
      would take too long. Each physician must get a habit of doing this for himself. In his ability
      to do this lies the superior skillfulness of the homœopathic practitioner. Without this he
      can only hope for indifferent success at most, and will be driven to all sorts of experiments,
      adjuvants, surgical measures and so forth which might be avoided, much to his own credit, and
      the advantage of his patient. The sleeplessness of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>
      patient is owing to the pain and excessive nerve sensibility and this remedy procures sleep by
      overcoming these troubles, which make the patient sleepless. Now there are a few symptoms,
      when occurring in conjunction with the peculiar mind and nervous symptoms of this remedy, that
      confirm the choice of it, such as.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Warm sweat on the head wetting the hair."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pressing earache in spells; tearing pain extorting; cries."</p>

      were in the stomach. " (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vom</font></i>.).</p>

      quantities without relief."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stools green, watery, corroding (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph</font></i>.),
      like stirred eggs."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stools hot, smelling like rotten eggs."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Metrorrhagia dark coagulated blood, flowing in paroxysms."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Menstrual colic, also following anger."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Labor pains press upward, or begin in back, and pass off down inner
      side of things."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Rigidity of os, pains unendurable."</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Children have spasms, from fit of anger in the nurse."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Cough from tickling in throat pit."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Cough dry, worse at night, especially <i><font color="#0000ff">while

      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Chronic cough, worse in winter or cold weather."</p>

      <p align="justify">This does not by any means cover all the symptoms which indicate <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>, but when they do occur it is strongly indicated and
      shows something of the range and usefulness of this remedy when given according to
      homœopathic rules.</p>
