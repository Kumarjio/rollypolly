      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea cruda</font></i>, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>,
      acts strongly upon the nervous system. Indeed in nervous troubles, where the patient has not
      been addicted to the coffee habit, it often takes precedence.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If on the other hand he is a coffee drinker, <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>
      is the remedy. Doctor Teste, of Paris, used to say that coffee was responsible for a large
      proportion of the neuralgias of France. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> patient
      is a subject of very great general exalted sensibility. See Hering's characteristic cards.
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">All the senses more acute, reads fine print easier, smell,
      taste and touch acute, particularly also in increased perception of slight passive motions</font></i>."
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">Unusual activity of mind and body</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Full of ideas, quick to act, no sleep on this account</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Lively fancies, full of plans for the future</font></i>." These symptoms
      portray, as plainly as words can, the nervous conditions calling for this remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It makes one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>, but
      the <b><font color="#ff0000">mind</font></b> of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla is not
      there</font></i>. On the other hand, it makes one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>,
      but the fear of death is not there. Hering used to recommend <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> in alternation in painful inflammatory
      affections, where the fever symptoms of the former and also the nervous sensibility of the
      latter were present, and I know of no two remedies that alternate better, though I never do
      it, since I learned to closely individualize. <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> is
      especially adapted to mental shocks, such as <i><font color="#0000ff">sudden surprises,
      especially joyful surprises, excessive laughter and playing, disappointed love, noises, strong
      smells</font></i>, etc. It is also adapted to variable moods; <i><font color="#0000ff">first
      crying then laughing, then crying again</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Coffea also vies with <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> as a pain remedy. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Pains.
      insupportable, drive to despair</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Exasperation,
      tears, tossing about in great anguish</font></i>." Here again we would not give <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> in an habitual coffee drinker, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>
      rather.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The particular localities where these pains mostly occur are in the head,
      where the pain is generally one-sided, feeling "<i><font color="#0000ff">as though a nail
      were driven into the head</font></i>." <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> has a
      similar headache, and it generally occurs in hysterical subjects. Then choice may have to be
      made between these two remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Prosopalgia, which is often traceable to bad teeth, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> has a very peculiar toothache, in the fact that the tooth is
      easy as long as he <i><font color="#0000ff">holds cold water upon it</font></i>. Remember <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> toothache is often caused by taking, <i><font color="#0000ff">warm</font></i> things into the mouth, but is not relieved by taking cold
      things like <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dysmenorrhœa, with excessively painful colic. If there are large <i><font color="#0000ff">black clots</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> does not
      relieve, follow with <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>. Pains threatening
      abortion, or after-pains, or very severe unbearable labor pains are often relieved by this
      remedy. In short, for pains anywhere, which seem intolerable, and there are no other
      especially leading symptoms, <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> is to be remembered.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The same over-excitability, so characteristic of this drug, causes great <i><font color="#0000ff">sleeplessness</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> has
      won to itself great credit as a <i><font color="#0000ff">sleep</font></i> remedy. In my
      experience and observation, it works best here in the 200th potency. And there is no more
      beautiful verification of the truth of <i><font color="#0000ff">Similia</font></i> than just
      here, for it <i><font color="#0000ff">causes great sleeplessness</font></i> in many people
      when taken in large quantities. Cough and sleeplessness after measles (a very common
      occurrence) is wonderfully relieved by it, and it is sleep, not narcosis, and never injures or
      sickens the patient like the <i><font color="#0000ff">stupor</font></i> of the opium
      preparations.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> is another one of the long list of our nervous remedies.
      Its peculiar mental symptoms, like those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Chamomilla, Nux
      vomica</font></i> and many others, are most characteristic. Like these remedies, it seems to
      exalt the impressionability of all the senses; but unlike the others, it has in it a marked
      element of sadness, and disposition to <i><font color="#0000ff">silent grieving</font></i>.
      Anyone suffering from suppressed, deep grief, with long drawn sighs, much sobbing, etc., and
      especially if inclined to smother or hide that grief from others, is just the subject for this
      remedy. She desires to he alone with her grief. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sighs much</font></i>
      and seems so sad and weak. The weakness is complained of right in the pit of the stomach. She
      feels weak, faint, and "<i><font color="#0000ff">all gone</font></i>" there. Another
      equally characteristic state or mind is a <b><font color="#ff0000">changeable mood</font></b>.
      No remedy can equal <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> for this. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Coffea, Nux moschata</font></i> and a few others have it, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> in the greatest degree. And so this remedy becomes one of
      our best in the treatment of hysterical affections. The patient is at one time full of glee
      and merriment, to be followed suddenly with the other extreme, of melancholy sadness and
      tears, and so these states of mind rapidly alternate. Again, we have in <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> an impatient, <i><font color="#0000ff">quarrelsome, angry
      mood</font></i> (but not to the degree of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>) at
      times. Again the <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> patient is, because of her
      excessive impressibility, easily frightened. Here it becomes one of our best remedies for the
      effects of fright, vying with <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Opium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album.</font></i> In short, <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      may justly be termed Pre-eminently the remedy of <b><font color="#ff0000">moods</font></b>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Aside from its mental symptoms, it is a great nervous remedy. Its acts upon
      the spine as decidedly as <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, affecting both motor
      and sensory nerves. It is one of our best remedies for spasms or convulsions, and is
      especially adapted to spasmodic affections originating in mental causes, as after <i><font color="#0000ff">fright, punishment of children</font></i> or other strong emotions. In one
      case of puerperal convulsions, other remedies having failed to do any good, the consulting
      physician while observing the patient during one of the spasms noticed that she came out of it
      with a succession of long drawn sighs. He inquired if the patient had had any recent mental
      trouble, and learned that she had lost her mother, of whom she was exceedingly fond, and whom
      she had mourned for greatly, a few weeks before. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      30th quickly cured her. Again, short of actual convulsions, <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      has, in a most marked degree, <b><font color="#ff0000">twitchings</font></b> all over the
      body, hence it becomes one of our best remedies for chorea, especially if caused by fright or
      grief on the mental side, or teething or worms on the reflex irritation side. There is only
      one remedy that comes near it for these twitchings and that is <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum
      metallicum</font></i>. Of course, <i><font color="#0000ff">Agaricus, Hyoscyamus, Cuprum met.</font></i>,
      etc., come close, and some might think are equal. <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum viride</font></i>,
      when better known, may lay claim to high rank here. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      is sometimes recommended for paralysis, but will be found, I think, exceptionally useful, and
      that mainly in hysterical cases, which are not of a very dangerous character. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Chamomilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea, Ignatia</font></i>
      is <i><font color="#0000ff">over-sensitive</font></i> to pain.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>, like its male partner, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i>, is a great remedy for headaches of nervous, especially hysterically
      nervous, subjects. That would be about the same as saying, that while <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i> is adapted to nervous men <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> is the
      same for women, which is quite true. You will remember that hysterical, nervous headaches are
      often one-sided. Hence <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> is such an efficient remedy
      for headaches as expressed in these words: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Headache as if a
      nail there driven out through the side of the head relieved by lying on it</font></i>."
      These headaches come on in highly nervous and sensitive subjects, or in those whose nervous
      systems have suffered from over-anxiety, grief or mental work. The <i><font color="#0000ff">ever-changeable
      and contradictory</font></i> symptoms so characteristic of the drug shows here as elsewhere.
      Not only does the pain in head change locality but at one time the pain will come on gradually
      and abate suddenly (like <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i> ), or, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>, it will come on suddenly and abate as suddenly as it
      came. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Gelsemium, Silicea</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album</font></i>, the headache often terminates with a <i><font color="#0000ff">profuse flow of urine</font></i>. That is often the case in headaches of
      nervous hysterical women. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lac defloratum</font></i>, profuse flow <i><font color="#0000ff">during</font></i> headache).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Finally the headaches are aggravated by coffee, smoking, the abuse of
      snuff, inhaling tobacco smoke, alcohol, close attention, from pressing at stool, and, while it
      is sometimes relieved while eating, is aggravated soon after. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      headache is sometimes accompanied by hunger like that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>.
      It is also &lt; by cold winds, turning head suddenly, stooping, change of position, running,
      looking up long, moving the eyes, noise and light.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is ameliorated by <i><font color="#0000ff">warmth, lying on it, soft
      pressure, external heat and profuse flow of limpid urine. Ignatia</font></i> has some strong
      throat symptoms. In the first place it has the so commonly observed symptom called "<i><font color="#0000ff">globus hystericus</font></i>," or as if a lump came up from the stomach
      into the throat as if she would choke. She swallows it down but it comes right back and is
      very distressing. It is especially apt to come if she gets <i><font color="#0000ff">grieved</font></i>
      and wants to cry. These are of course purely nervous sensations, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      goes further, and also cures real serious affections of the throat like tonsillitis and
      diphtheria. In these cases the real characteristic symptom is, that the pain and suffering in
      the throat is <i><font color="#0000ff">relieved by swallowing</font></i> or is worse between
      the acts of deglutition. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Capsicum</font></i>). A very peculiar
      symptom for such troubles, for such cases are generally <i><font color="#0000ff">aggravated</font></i>
      by swallowing, hence we would not expect to frequently find a case in which this would be the
      remedy; but such cases do arise occasionally and baffle us if we haven't the remedy. Here is
      where Homœopathy, as we say in base ball, "scores some of its best runs," and the
      satisfaction of curing such a case with an <i><font color="#0000ff">unusual</font></i> remedy
      is, to say the least, very gratifying to him who performs the cure. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> cases, in addition to the aggravation when swallowing
      liquids and relief from swallowing solids. This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>,
      you remember, but is the reverse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>, which can
      swallow liquids only; the least solid food gags. It is necessary to keep these correspondences
      and opposites in mind, for it often enables us to make what are called "snap shot"
      prescriptions and save much time, study and suffering.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Some of the particularly valuable "guiding symptoms" of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>, in addition to those already noticed, are "<i><font color="#0000ff">extreme aversion to tobacco smoke</font></i>." This is a general aversion
      and aggravates many, many complaints. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Weak, empty, gone feeling
      at the pit of the stomach</font></i>." In the case of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      this symptom is apt to be accompanied by a disposition to <i><font color="#0000ff">sigh</font></i>
      or take a long breath. Two other remedies have this symptom of goneness in the stomach as
      prominently as <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>. They are <i><font color="#0000ff">Hydrastis</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>. The other symptoms must decide between them.
      This weak feeling in the stomach in <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> is sometimes
      described as a feeling of flabbiness, as though the stomach <i><font color="#0000ff">hung down
      relaxed</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> has a similar feeling.
      Sometimes we come across very severe cases of gastralgia in women of hysterical tendencies.
      Here this remedy is the first to be thought of.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> has as positive action upon the anus and rectum as does <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Prolapsus of the rectum</font></i>
      is marked. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta graveolens</font></i>). Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> it has frequent desire for stool, but in place of stool,
      or with it, comes the prolapsed rectum. The patient is afraid to strain at stool, to stoop
      down or lift, for fear of the prolapsus. A contractive sore pain follows after a stool and
      lasts for an hour or two. This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric acid</font></i>, which
      has the same symptom only after a loose stool. There is also some pain in anus without
      reference to stool. Dunham, that prince of observers, gave us the characteristic: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Sharp pains shooting upward into the rectum</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> has similar pains in uterus). It is a gem, and has often been
      verified. So we see that <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> is one of our important
      anal and rectal remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is also very unique in its fever symptoms. There is no disease
      in which we are better able to show the power of the potentized remedy to cure, than
      intermittent fever. Chronic cases that have resisted the Quinine treatment for years are often
      quickly and permanently cured by the 200th and upwards. The following symptoms indicate <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>: 1st. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thirst during chill</font></i>
      and in no other stage. 2d. Chill, relieved by <i><font color="#0000ff">external heat</font></i>.
      3d. Heat aggravated by <i><font color="#0000ff">external covering</font></i>. 4th. <i><font color="#0000ff">Red face during the chill</font></i>. Here are four legs to the stool, and we
      may sit upon it in perfect confidence. No other remedy has thirst during chill and in no other
      stage. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, you will remember, the chill is not
      relieved by the heat of the stove, or the bed, and during the heat <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i> must be covered, as the least uncovering brings back the chill. So we see
      that notwithstanding the alkaloid of both drugs is <i><font color="#0000ff">strychnia</font></i>
      they differ widely when we come to apply them to the cure of the sick. The red face during
      chill led me to the cure of an obstinate case, and after I noticed the red face I also noticed
      that the boy was behind the stove in the warmest place he could find. The 200th promptly
      cured. Two other cases in the same family, at the same time, and from the same malarious
      district, were cured, one by <i><font color="#0000ff">Capsicum</font></i>, 200th. the other by
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium perfoliatum</font></i>, same potency. The former had chill
      beginning between shoulders, in the latter the chill in the A. M., great pain in bones before,
      and vomiting of bile at the end of chill. I do not know but I have mentioned these three cases
      before; but it will bear repeating, for it illustrates the <i><font color="#0000ff">efficacy
      of potencies</font></i> in obedience to our great law of cure. can any reasonable man doubt
      such evidence?</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Farrington says: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i> acts on
      the cerebro-spinal system, producing great debility of these organs. * * * It causes a
      paralytic weakness of the spine, and especially of its motor nerves; thus we find it a certain
      and frequent remedy in paralysis originating in disease of the spinal cord. * * * It is
      especially indicated in the beginning of the trouble, when the lumbar region of the spine is
      affected; there is weakness in the <i><font color="#0000ff">small of the back</font></i> as if
      paralyzed; the small of the back gives out when walking. There is weakness of the legs, and by
      the legs I mean the entire lower extremities; the knees give out when walking, the soles of
      the feet feel as if they were asleep, the thighs ache as if they were pounded; first one hand
      goes to sleep, then the other; sometimes the whole arm goes to sleep and the hand feels as if
      swollen. These symptoms lie at the foundation of the symptomatology of the whole drug; they
      all seem to depend upon spinal weakness." Dunham says: "Its sphere of action is
      preeminently the system of animal life; the voluntary muscular system first, and then the
      sensorium are the primary seats of action. Nausea extending to the point of vomiting and
      accompanied by faintness and by severe vertigo when lifting the head is a characteristic
      symptom." Hughes says: "It influences the voluntary muscles rather than the
      intellectual powers; with this Hahnemann's provings entirely agree." Pareira says:
      "It acts rather on the voluntary muscles than the intellectual powers." We have
      given these quotations from different authors in order to find whether they afforded us much
      help from a practical standpoint. Dr. Hughes says the provings of Hahnemann corroborate these
      generalizations. We quote from the provings:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Weakness of the cervical muscles with heaviness of the <i><font color="#0000ff">head, muscles seem unable to support the head</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Calc. phos, Verat. alb</font></i>.). "Paralytic pain in the small of the
      back, with spasmodic drawing across the hips, which prevents walking." "His knees
      sink down from weakness, he totters while walking and threatens to fall to one side."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"At one time his feet are asleep, at another the hands."
      "The hand trembles while eating, and the more the higher it is raised." "Now
      one hand, now the other, seems insensible and asleep." The soles of the feet go to sleep,
      while sitting." "General attacks of paralytic weakness, with pain in the back."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All these are verified symptoms from <i><font color="#0000ff">Allen's
      Encyclopædia of Pure Materia Medica</font></i>. They are in the simplest terms, and while
      they do agree with the statements of the above quoted learned men, acting upon the spine and
      motor muscles, could be applied to the cure of the sick according to the directions of
      Hahnemann by any layman of ordinary intelligence. Thus is the practice of curative medicine
      simplified, being delivered from speculative theorizings of dreamers, and if it will cure the
      sick in the case of a <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i> patient, it will by the
      same unerring law of "symptom covering" do it in every curable case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We might sum up the whole action of this remedy upon the nervous system in
      one word, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">prostration</font></i>, but what does that amount to
      for purposes of prescribing. Many remedies prostrate fearfully, but each one has its <i><font color="#0000ff">peculiar kind</font></i> of prostration, and when men, like I heard a
      celebrated surgeon in a homœopathic college do, make their boast that they prescribed on
      physiological ground, without any regard to symptomatology, I can but feel that such know
      little or nothing of the art of homœopathic prescribing, no matter what their other
      attainments. According to Hahnemann's teachings symptomatology leads in scientific
      prescribing, no matter what the pathological condition.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Aside from the symptoms which attend the general prostration and spinal
      trouble, or coupled with them, we have the following which are characteristic. "Confusion
      or stupefaction of the head, increased by eating and drinking." "Vertigo, as if
      intoxicated and confusion of the mind." "Whirling vertigo on rising up in bed; which
      compelled him to lie down again." "Sick headache with nausea and inclination to
      vomit." "All these symptoms are made particularly worse by riding in carriage or
      boat." Sea-sickness. (Sea-sickness &gt; on deck in fresh cold air.) (<i><font color="#0000ff">Tabac</font></i>.). The headaches and vertigo of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>
      are different from <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, notwithstanding the fact that
      both are made worse by rising up in bed. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and
      some other remedies the sickness at the stomach precedes the headache which in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i> is exactly the reverse. Painful sensation of weakness or <i><font color="#0000ff">emptiness</font></i> in the head is found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>
      and is in keeping with the general weakness. This sensation of <i><font color="#0000ff">emptiness</font></i>,
      which is another name for <i><font color="#0000ff">weakness</font></i>, is a general
      characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>, and is found in head, abdomen,
      bowels, chest, heart, stomach; in short, in all internal parts. The nausea of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>, which is so constant a symptom of the headaches, is
      something like that which is so characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i>,
      viz.: "Extreme aversion to food, caused even by the smell of food, although with
      hunger." With <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i> there is more pronounced
      nausea, as well as aversion. The patient is nauseated <i><font color="#0000ff">even to
      faintness</font></i>. There is with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i> a metallic
      taste in the mouth.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The sensorium comes under the same profound depression that invades the
      general nervous system. The patient is sad, absorbed within himself, brooding, moody, silent,
      sits in a corner buried in sad thoughts, etc. This is particularly the case in nervous fevers.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Depression, depression, depression</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i> has some very important symptoms in the abdominal and
      uterine regions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One is <i><font color="#0000ff">great distention of the abdomen</font></i>.
      This is found in both flatulent colic and dysmenorrhœa. In flatulent colic, for which it is
      so valuable a remedy, the patient complains of a sensation as if the abdomen were full of
      sharp sticks or stones. The attacks are often at mid-night. The flatus seems here and there,
      and passage of it does not seem to relieve much, for new forms again take its place.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Then again there seems to be great pressure in the inguinal region as if <i><font color="#0000ff">hernia</font></i> would occur. In dysmenorrhœa, in addition to the
      distention, there are <i><font color="#0000ff">griping</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">cramping</font></i>
      pains, which are very severe, and also a remarkable degree of <i><font color="#0000ff">weakness</font></i>.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">She is so weak that she can hardly stand, walk or talk</font></i>.
      This is very characteristic and, so far as weakness goes, resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo
      animalis</font></i>, but in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i> it is in line with
      the general prostration of the remedy, while in <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo animalis</font></i>
      the <b><font color="#ff0000">flow</font></b> weakens her. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>
      the flow may not be at all excessive, but on the contrary may grow less and less and a
      leucorrhœa appear in its stead, or even between the menses also. This is the way we have to
      differentiate between remedies if we are successful in practice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, if I were to give the four great characteristic symptoms of this
      remedy they would be these:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1. Weakness of cervical muscles, with heaviness of head.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2. Affections caused or &lt; by riding in cars, carriage or boat.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">3. Sensation of weakness, or hollowness in various organs.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">4. Ill effects from loss of sleep, night-watching or over-work. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum Cuprum met., Ignatia, Nitric acid.</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="CONIUM_MACULATUM"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">CONIUM MACULATUM.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Vertigo, especially &lt; on turning the head, or looking around sidewise,
      or turning in bed.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Swelling and induration of glands, after contusions or bruises.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Cancerous and scrofulous persons with enlarged glands.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Urine flows, stops and flows again intermittently, prostatic or uterine
      affections.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Breasts sore, hard and painful during menstrual period.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is another of the so-called spinal remedies. I will not, as I did
      under <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i> quote what authorities say from a
      pathological standpoint. All seem to agree that it paralyzes from below upwards, and the
      poisoning of Socrates with it is adduced in illustration. It ought to be a remedy for
      locomotor ataxia The strongest characteristic I know, from a homœopathic standpoint, it its
      peculiar vertigo, which is much aggravated by <i><font color="#0000ff">turning the head
      sidewise</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Coloc</font></i>., turning head to left).
      Turning over in bed is the same. Some say <i><font color="#0000ff">lying down in bed and
      turning over</font></i>. I have found that it is not so much the <i><font color="#0000ff">lying
      down</font></i> as it is the turning of the <i><font color="#0000ff">head sidewise</font></i>,
      whether in an upright or horizontal posture.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once treated a case of what seemed to be locomotor ataxia with this
      remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient had been slowly losing the use of his legs; could not stand at
      the dark; and when he walked along the street would make his wife walk either ahead of him, or
      behind him, for the act of looking sidewise at her or in the least turning head or eyes that
      way would cause him to stagger or fall.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> cured him. It would always aggravate at first, but he
      would greatly improve after stopping the remedy. The aggravation was just as invariable after
      taking a dose of Fincke's c. m. potency as from anything lower, but the improvement lasted
      longer after it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Taking an occasional dose from a week to four weeks apart completely cured
      him in about a year. It was a bad case, of years' standing, before I took him.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have often verified this symptom in the vertigo of old people, where it
      is most frequently found; but it also often accompanies various affections in all ages, and
      especially is found in ovarian and uterine affections. I know of no remedy that has this
      symptom so strongly.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a form of ophthalmia in strumous subjects which calls for <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> in preference to any other remedy, and the peculiar,
      prominent and uncommon (as Hahnemann says, Organon, § 153) symptom is, <i><font color="#0000ff">photophobia, intense, out of all proportion to the objective signs</font></i>
      of inflammation in the eye. The pains are worse at night and terribly aggravated by the least
      ray of light, relieved in dark room and by pressure.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There may or may not be ulcers on the cornea. <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i>
      is also one of our best remedies for falling of the eyelids, as are three other remedies, viz:
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium, Causticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>.
      "Swelling and induration of glands, with tingling and stitches after <i><font color="#0000ff">contusions or bruises</font></i>." Many cases of lumps or swellings in
      the breasts (for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> seems to have a particular
      affinity) have disappeared under the action of this remedy. Even cancerous affections of
      breasts (<i><font color="#0000ff">Asterias rubens</font></i>), uterus and stomach have been
      helped or cured, especially if the trouble seems to have originated in a <i><font color="#0000ff">blow or injury</font></i> to the part. It is perhaps the first remedy to be
      thought of in all cases of tumors, scirrhous or otherwise, coming on after contusions,
      especially if they are of stony hardness and heavy feeling. <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> both have hardness of mammæ, <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> right, <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> left
      nodules (<i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo animalis, Conium, Silicea</font></i>); acute
      lancinating pains. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Asterias</font></i>). Again it is to be
      especially considered if at every menstrual period the breasts become <i><font color="#0000ff">large,
      sore and painful</font></i>, aggravated by the <i><font color="#0000ff">least jar or walking</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In all the scirrhous affections of the breast, womb or other parts the
      pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> are burning, stinging, or darting, and may
      make one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis mellifica</font></i>. The other symptoms must
      then decide between them.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> has marked action upon the sexual organs. In the male
      there is great weakness of the organs. He has intense desire and amorous thoughts, but is
      unable to perform. He has emissions at the very thought or presence of a woman. The erections
      are insufficient, last only a short time, or "go back" on him in the act of embrace,
      and he suffers with weakness and chagrin afterwards. This affects the mind and hypochondriasis
      of the bluest blue takes possession of him.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This condition of mind may obtain in both sexes; as a result of too free,
      and also especially too <b><font color="#ff0000">infrequent</font></b> indulgence; or,
      excessive abstemiousness. Hence <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> becomes a good
      remedy for old bachelors and old maids. If the vertigo is also present in such cases <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> is sure to be of great benefit.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Intermittent flow of urine is very characteristic</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Clematis</font></i>). One might think that this was owing to a paralytic
      condition of the bladder. I don't know; but I do know that the symptom often occurs in the
      hypertrophy of the prostate gland incident to old age and <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i>
      helps. "Sweats day or night; <i><font color="#0000ff">as soon as one sleeps or even when
      closing the eyes</font></i>," is a characteristic found under no other remedy that I know
      of. (Reverse <i><font color="#0000ff">Sambucus</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Adolph Lippe once made a splendid cure of complete one-sided paralysis
      in a man 80 years of age with this remedy, and was guided to it by this symptom. I think it
      would be rather a difficult task to give a correct pathological explanation of such a symptom;
      but there is a reason, and whether we can give it or not we can cure it if we have a
      corresponding one appearing under a remedy; where a cure is at all possible.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is interesting to follow out the connections of symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Take for instance the single prominent symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i>,
