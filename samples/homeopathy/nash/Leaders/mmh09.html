      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is one of the remedies that is not so remarkable for its wide range of
      action as it is for positiveness within its range. Almost all its usefulness, so far as known,
      centres in its action in the lower back and pelvic region and ever prominent is this
      characteristic: <i><font color="#0000ff">Constant dull backache, affecting sacrum and hips,
      much aggravated by walking or stooping</font></i>. It is one of our leading remedies for
      hæmorrhoids, and in addition to this backache there is a feeling of <i><font color="#0000ff">fullness,
      dryness</font></i>, and sticking as if the rectum was <i><font color="#0000ff">full of sticks</font></i>.
      There is not the tendency to protrusion or prolapsus that there is in <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia,
      Aloe, Podophyllum</font></i> and some other remedies, and the backache is often greatly out of
      proportion to any external evidence of piles. This feeling of <i><font color="#0000ff">fullness</font></i>
      seems to be a sort of general characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus</font></i>,
      but is especially prominent in the pelvic cavity.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These symptoms are often found in conjunction with other affections besides
      hæmorrhoids, such as uterine displacements, and inflammations; and some very bad forms of <i><font color="#0000ff">leucorrhœa</font></i> have been promptly cured by this remedy. There is
      another quite valuable symptom in these pelvic troubles, viz.: <i><font color="#0000ff">throbbing</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">beating</font></i> sensations, that calls for <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus</font></i>. I have seen equally good results from the use of this
      remedy in the 3d, and the potencies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I used <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus</font></i> with great results in
      coryza and sore throat. The coryza is very much like the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
      coryza, thin, watery, and burning, but what characterizes <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus</font></i>
      here is sensation of rawness: <i><font color="#0000ff">sensitive to inhaled cold air</font></i>.
      In the throat it has the same sensation of rawness, both in the acute form, and also in
      chronic follicular pharyngitis, for which it is often a good remedy. It may be that age and
      use will develop more uses for this remedy.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Child cries out during sleep; rolls the head from side to side; face
      alternately pale and red.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This metal seems to act principally upon the nervous system. I think it is
      Burt who says: "What <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> is to the blood, <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> is to the nerves." If we examine the provings and
      clinical records of <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i>, we find that it seems to have
      the power to arouse or strengthen the nervous system in its inability to supply force to carry
      on functions necessary to health or the elimination of disease products from the system. This
      is speculation. What are the facts? 1st. If scarlatina or other eruptive diseases do not
      properly develop the eruption, on account of too great weakness of the patient, as evidenced
      by general depression of pulse, temperature, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> is
      very useful.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Other remedies have such or similar trouble, <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i>,
      for instance; but in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i> the eruption has been
      suppressed by some outward cause. <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i>, it has never come
      to the surface, or it has been out, and has receded from lack of vitality or strength to hold
      it there. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> may be the remedy, but the cause is then
      more often apt to be traceable to psora.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This weakness shows in other ways, as, for instance, in asthma. The patient
      <i><font color="#0000ff">can't expectorate</font></i>, but as soon as he can he is relieved;
      or again she <i><font color="#0000ff">cannot menstruate</font></i>, and is relieved of her
      suffering while menstruating. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another peculiarity connected with this characteristic. The
      nervous weakness of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum</font></i> patient is that he can take
      no wine or stimulants. You would think that a little wine would at least temporarily relieve;
      on the contrary, it aggravates all the sufferings, even though taken in small quantities. Of
      course other remedies have this aggravation from wines or stimulants, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine, Ledum, Fluoric acid, Antimonium crudum</font></i>, etc., but I think
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> stands first.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The nervous debility of <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> shows in
      other ways also. There is sometimes <i><font color="#0000ff">aching and weariness in the nape
      of the neck</font></i>, as it had been held in one position too long, &lt; by writing or other
      long continued labor. The backaches are worse while <i><font color="#0000ff">sitting</font></i>
      and better when moving about. This would call to mind <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus
      toxicodendron</font></i>, but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum</font></i> you would not
      get the <i><font color="#0000ff">general</font></i> aching relieved by continued motion, as in
      the case with <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus. Pulsatilla</font></i> has it also, but generally
      in connection with menstrual irregularities. The remedy most resembling <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> in this particular is <i><font color="#0000ff">Cobalt</font></i>.
      Both these remedies have this symptom in consequence of sexual excesses or weaknesses, but in <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> an emission temporarily relieves the pain and in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cobalt</font></i> it does not. The most characteristic of all the symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> in connection with its general nervous weakness, is: "<i><font color="#0000ff">An incessant, violent fidgety feeling in the feet or lower limbs; must move
      them constantly</font></i>." This is present in many, if not almost all, of the
      affections for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i> is <i><font color="#0000ff">par
      excellence</font></i> the remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is also sometimes present "burning along the whole length of the
      spine." This burning is purely subjective, for there is no actual local increase of
      temperature. Another characteristic of this remedy is, "<i><font color="#0000ff">twitching
      and jerking of various muscles</font></i>." I spoke of this symptom when writing upon <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>. I would place <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum, Ignatia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Agaricus</font></i> in the van of all remedies for causing and
      curing these general twitchings.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another symptom for which this is one of our best remedies is, <i><font color="#0000ff">general trembling</font></i>. This is also from prostration.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient loses control over his motions, although he is not yet
      paralyzed. Paralysis may come later if this condition is not remedied.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A word or two about the importance of this remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">brain troubles</font></i>. It makes little difference whether the affection of
      the brain arises from suppressed eruptive diseases, dentition, typhus fever or disease of any
      other name or nature, if the symptoms indicating the remedy are present. Allow me to relate a
      case from my own practice illustrating its curative value in typhoid A young lady about 20
      years of age complained, a week before I was called, of weakness, or feeling of general
      prostration; headache, and loss of appetite, but the greatest complaint was of prostration.
      She was a student and her mother, who was an excellent nurse, attributed all her sickness to
      overwork at school, and tried to rest and "nurse her up." But she continued to grow
      worse. I prescribed for her <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> and followed it with
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> according to indications, and she ran through a
      mild course of two weeks longer, and seemed convalescing quite satisfactorily.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Being left in a room alone, while sleeping and perspiring, she threw off
      her clothes, caught cold and relapsed. Of course the "last state of that patient was
      worse than the first." The bowels became enormously distended profuse hæmorrhage
      occurred, which was finally controlled by <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumen</font></i>, a low
      form of delirium came on, the prostration became extreme notwithstanding the hæmorrhage was
      checked, until the following picture obtained -staring eyes rolled upward into the head, head
      retracted; complete unconsciousness, lying on back and sliding down in bed, twitching, or
      rather intense, <i><font color="#0000ff">violent trembling all over, so that</font></i> she
      shook the bed. I had nurses hold her hands night and day, she shook and trembled so;
      hippocratic face, extremities deathly cold to knees and elbows, pulse so weak and quick I
      could not count it, and intermittent; in short, all signs of impending paralysis of the brain.
      The case seemed hopeless, but I put ten drops of <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum metallicum</font></i>
      in two drams of cold water, and worked one-half of it between her set teeth, a little at a
      time, and an hour after the other half. In about one hour after the last dose she turned her
      eyes down and faintly said, <i><font color="#0000ff">milk</font></i>. Through a bent tube she
      swallowed a half glass of milk, the first nourishment she had received in 24 hours. She got no
      more medicine for four days, and improved steadily all the time. She afterward received a dose
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> and progressed rapidly to a perfect
      recovery. So <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum</font></i> 200th can, like other metals, perform
      miracles when <i><font color="#0000ff">indicated</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains gradually increase to a great height, and as gradually subside.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another metallic remedy. The leading characteristic is <i><font color="#0000ff">great weakness in the chest</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum met</font></i>.);
      so weak cannot talk. No remedy has this symptom so strongly as tin. It is present, not only in
      the laryngeal and lung troubles for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> is such
      a great remedy, but in <i><font color="#0000ff">great debility</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">So weak she drops into a chair</font></i>, &lt; going down stairs (<i><font color="#0000ff">Borax; Calc. ost. up stairs</font></i>). It is found in connection with
      uterine displacements and leucorrhœas of thin, debilitated subjects and has made brilliant
      cures in such cases. Of course in the lung, bronchial, and laryngeal affections, this symptom
      is <i><font color="#0000ff">very</font></i> prominent. In these troubles there is generally
      very profuse expectoration with the cough, and the matter raised tastes <i><font color="#0000ff">very sweet</font></i>, or it may be exceptionally salty. For the salty
      expectoration I would sooner think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali iod</font></i>. or <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>. In all three of these remedies the expectoration may be
      thick, heavy, and green or yellow in color. Both <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali iod</font></i>. have profuse night sweats, but the <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> has greater sense of weakness in the chest (cannot talk)
      than any of the others. Another very characteristic symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>
      is that the <i><font color="#0000ff">pains gradually increase to a great degree of intensity
      and then as gradually decrease</font></i>. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Platinum</font></i>.)
      This pain is of course neuralgic, may be located anywhere in the tract of a nerve, but has
      been often verified in prosopalgia, gastralgia and abdominal colic.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These pains are ameliorated by pressure, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>; so if <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>
      fails, which is generally first thought of in abdominal pains relieved by pressure, <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> may relieve, and especially if the attacks have been of
      long standing or the patient seems to have a chronic tendency thereto. If in children, the
      patient is relieved by carrying it over the point of the shoulder, the shoulder pressing into
      the abdomen. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> patient is generally very sad and
      despondent, feels like crying all the time. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nat. m., Puls., Sepia</font></i>.)
      I have often verified the above symptoms and have seen equally good effects from the 12th,
      30th, 200th and 500th (Boericke &amp; Tafel) potencies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="PLATINA"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains increase gradually and as gradually decrease (<i><font color="#0000ff">Stann</font></i>.); sometimes attended with numbness (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cham</font></i>.).</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy may be studied in three relations: in its relation to the
      mental, nervous and sexual systems. It has curious mental symptoms. Here are three of them:
      "Pride and over-estimation of one's self; looking down with haughtiness on others."
      "Illusion of fancy, on entering the house after walking an hour, as if everything about
      her were very small, and all persons mentally and physically inferior, but she herself
      physically and mentally superior." "Changing moods, gay and sad alternately."
      This last symptom is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia, Crocus, Nux moschata</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i>
      has another symptom like <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> -"fear of
      death." Now the first two symptoms above mentioned might appear to some as of no
      practical value in the treatment of the sick. There is no pathological explanation for them
      beyond the fact of a generally disordered mind, which might take any other form of
      hallucination -But this is a valuable indication and found under no other remedy. I was led by
      it to prescribe the remedy in a very obstinate case of insanity which had resisted the skill
      of several allopathic physicians of note, and they had finally decided that the case must be
      sent to the insane asylum. The parents however, who were quite wealthy, could not consent to
      that, and were induced to try Homœopathy. I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i>
      on the strength of this mental indication, which was very prominent, coupled with another
      prominent symptom, which also appears under this remedy, viz, "physical symptoms
      disappear and mental symptoms appear" and <i><font color="#0000ff">vice versa</font></i>.
      The physical symptoms was a pain the whole length of the spine. This was the symptom
      alternating with the mental one. It was one of the most brilliant cures I ever saw.
      Improvement began the first day and never flagged, and she remained well now 15 years with
      never a sign of return.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The nervous symptoms outside the brain symptoms calling for <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i> are: 1st "The pains <i><font color="#0000ff">increase
      gradually</font></i> and as <i><font color="#0000ff">gradually decrease</font></i>." 2nd.
      "This pains are attended with numbness of the parts" This first symptom you will
      remember is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> but the <i><font color="#0000ff">Platinum</font></i>
      patient is not characteristically so weak as the <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>
      one. The second one is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>, but the <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i> patient is not so unvaryingly ugly as the <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> one. Both are great mental remedies, however, and if any
      question arises (as there may) a close study of them in their entirety may be necessary.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In regard to the gradual outset of the pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum, Belladonna</font></i> has exactly the opposite: but <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> more resembles the <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i>
      in its brain symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sexual organs. "Nymphomania aggravated in the lying-in; tingling or
      tittilation up into the abdomen." "Excessive sexual desire, especially in virgins;
      premature or excessive development of sexual instinct." "Genitals excessively
      sensitive; cannot bear to be touched; will almost go into a spasm from an examination, and
      almost faint during intercourse." "Metrorrhagia or profuse menses; blood black and
      clotted."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Ovarian trouble and prolapsus with the profuse menses and excessive
      sensitiveness of the genitals to touch or coition. All these are very strong indications for
      this remedy. All these symptoms, mental, nervous, spasmodic, sexual, etc., would indicate that
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i> ought to be a good remedy for that protean malady,
      hysteria, and so abundant experience has proven it to be. Here again I have, as in the case of
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>,
      found the higher preparation of the drug most potent for good, though in, a case of insanity I
      used the 6th, not having it high at that time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Platina has a form of constipation similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i>,

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is another metal that, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>,
      has for its most characteristic condition, excessive weakness. But the weakness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Selenium</font></i> does not, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>,
      seem to centre in any particular locality. It is more general. He is so weak that he is easily
      exhausted from any kind of labor, either mental or physical. This debility follows any
      exhaustive disease like typhoid fever, or may come from seminal emissions. The weakness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Selenium</font></i> shows itself as much in the male sexual organs, as it does
      generally. Erections are slow and weak, emissions of semen too rapid in coition and he is
      cross and weak afterwards. Sexual desire strong, but he is <i><font color="#0000ff">physically
      impotent</font></i>. Has seminal emissions two or three times a week, and gets up with weak,
      lame back after them. Prostatic fluid oozes while sitting, during sleep, when walking, or at
      stool. I this weakness has been of long standing, he begins to emaciate, especially in the <i><font color="#0000ff">face, hands and thighs</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Acetic acid</font></i>.)
      This is a picture of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Selenium</font></i> prostration. Aside from
      or connected with it are a few other characteristic symptoms such as constipation, the stool
      being of such immense size that it cannot be discharged without mechanical aid. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sanicula</font></i>). It must be picked away with the fingers. Involuntary
      dribbling of urine while walking, or after urinating or stool (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sarsaparilla</font></i>
      dribbles while sitting).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Bad effects from drinking too much tea; all complaints are aggravated by
      it. Irresistible longing for spirituous liquors. Hoarseness, must often clear the throat of
      mucus especially at the beginning of singing. Irresistible desire for stimulants, wants to get
      drunk but feels worse after it. Very forgetful in business, but during sleep dreams of what he
      had forgotten. I have never used this metal below the 200th potency.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As a general characteristic, <b><font color="#ff0000">Burning</font></b> is
      almost as strong under this remedy as under <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. There is no organ or tissue in which it may not be found,
      from the outer skin to the innermost surface of every tract or parenchyma. It may be
      subjective only without actual rise of temperature, or it may attend organic changes in
      malignant diseases, with great rise of temperature. The sensation of <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>
      in an intense degree should always place <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> in the
      front rank for consideration. Again, there is perhaps no remedy having stronger action on <b><font color="#ff0000">The Nervous System</font></b>. It attacks it in its very citadel of strength,
      the brain and spinal cord, producing softening or atrophy with all its attendant symptoms in
      their order, as prostration, trembling, numbness, and complete paralysis. It does this in both
      acute and chronic form of disease.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It will be found in acute typhoids as well as in that slowly progressive
      disease, locomotor ataxia. Its causes may be sudden, like pneumonia, typhus, exanthematic
      diseases, croup, bronchitis, when vitality reaches its lowest ebb, or may arise in a condition
      undermined by grief, care, or excessive mental exertion; excess in venery or onanism.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Its action at the first may be characterized by a burning heat in various
      parts, and especially in the skin, with restless moving and anxiety, especially at twilight.
      Over-sensitiveness of all senses, such as external impressions; light, odors, noises, touch,
      etc., and later when organic changes have taken place the other extreme, of loss of motion,
      sensation, and sensitiveness obtains.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In the former state there is one very characteristic symptom, <i><font color="#0000ff">the patient moves continually, can't sit or stand still a moment</font></i>.
      Instead of fidgety feet, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum</font></i>, he is <i><font color="#0000ff">fidgety all over</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
      affects every tissue. The blood becomes broken down or impoverished. Chlorosis and pernicious
      anæmia obtain. <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      carb</font></i>. also each have anæmia or a pale waxy or what is called bloodless appearance
      of the patient. They all have œdema or bloating, and there is one peculiar difference in the
      face between them. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb</font></i>. the upper lids bloat and
      hang down like a bag of water. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> it is more in the
      lower lids, while in <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> they bloat all around the
      eyes; and the whole face bloats. Under <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> the
      blood becomes so broken down that it will not clot any more, and we have purpura hæmorrhagica.
      Even in apparently healthy tissues we have this strong characteristic discovered by Hahnemann,
      viz.: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Slight wounds bleed much</font></i>." This is what
      is called the hæmorrhagic diathesis, and much to be feared, as many persons having it may
      bleed to death from any slight abrasion; and this same tendency to bleed extends to fungoid
      growths like fibroids, fungoids, cancers, etc., and are very dangerous and troublesome.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Then again <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> attacks the bones
      in the form of necrosis. It is so especially of the lower jaw, but is also true of other
      parts, as the vertebræ; and I once cured a very extensive and long standing case of caries of
      the tibia with it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Fatty degeneration of heart, liver and kidneys, with the characteristic
      anæmic condition, should call attention to this remedy. General emaciation, rapid or slowly
      progressing like atrophy in children, also comes under its tissue destroying power.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">And so we find it to be a remedy of wide range and great power. But it is
      never enough for the homœopathist to know simply the action in general upon any organ or set
      of organs. He must know how it acts differently from other remedies when acting upon the same
      tissue or organs. Now while <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> acts upon the mind,
      to cause, "great anxiety and restlessness" as in other remedies, <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Arsenicum</font></i>, etc, it must be remembered that it is the
      anxiety and restlessness that precedes another state.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It belongs to a stage of irritation in the brain and nervous system which
      if not checked will go on to organic changes, which will be attended with a very different set
      of symptoms such as come for instance from actual brain softening in which appears <i><font color="#0000ff">apathy, sluggishness; talks slowly, is indifferent or won't talk at all</font></i>.
      There is one particular symptom worthy of note: <i><font color="#0000ff">the patient fears to
      be left alone</font></i>; is afraid: afraid of the dark, in a thunder storm, etc. This is more
      during the irritable stage of which we have spoken. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
      is a great remedy in typhoids, especially with lung complications, and here we often get
      stupor and low muttering delirium like <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, but while
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> is worse after sleep, <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
      is generally better, if he can get to sleep. In the late stage of brain or nervous troubles,
      calling for this remedy, we find the patient losing all ambition to do anything; either mental
      or physical labor is shunned. There is great indifference. He cannot think with his usual
      clearness; cannot apply himself to study or mental operations, ideas come slowly or not at
      all. Again the patient is sometimes amative, or like <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>
      shamelessly exposes himself.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is no remedy that covers a greater variety of mind symptoms arising
      from brain trouble than <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>. No remedy produces
      greater vertigo, with a longer list of various connections. I have found it one of the best
      and oftenest indicated for <i><font color="#0000ff">vertigo of the aged</font></i>. Chronic
      congestion to the head is characteristic, and the sense of burning in the brain is prominent;
      the heat and congestion seems to <i><font color="#0000ff">come up from the spine</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Heat running up the back</font></i> is more characteristic of this than any
      other remedy. Deafness is prominent, and is peculiar, in that it is especially <i><font color="#0000ff">deafness to the human voice</font></i>, a common symptom in the aged. The most
      frequent use I have made of the remedy in nose affections is in a chronic catarrh, in which
      the patient frequently blows <i><font color="#0000ff">small quantities of blood from the nose</font></i>;
      the handkerchief is <i><font color="#0000ff">always</font></i> bloody.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As I said when writing upon the tissues, the face of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> is characteristically pale and bloated around the eyes,
      but in pneumonia we often find circumscribed redness of the cheek upon the side of the lung
      inflamed. This is also true with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanguinaria</font></i>. About the
      mouth and tongue I do not know anything particularly characteristic. It has a peculiar symptom
      of the throat. <i><font color="#0000ff">The food swallowed comes up immediately as if it had
      never reached the stomach</font></i>. This is supposed to be due to spasmodic stricture of the
      œsophagus.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Under appetite and thirst we have some very valuable indications for this
      remedy.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Hunger</font></i> is one, must eat often or he faints; right after or soon
      after a meal, is hungry; hungry in the night; must eat. He is relieved by eating, but is soon
      hungry again. This calls to mind <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine, Chelidonium, Petroleum,
      Anacardium</font></i>, etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The thirst is also peculiar. He wants <i><font color="#0000ff">cold things</font></i>,
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, but <i><font color="#0000ff">as soon as
      they get warm in the stomach they are vomited</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Some people have an abnormal craving for salt, or salt food, and eat too
      much of it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> is a good remedy to counteract the
      bad effects. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nat. mur</font></i>.).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We have many kinds of vomiting under <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>,
      but nothing characteristic except the one already mentioned.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We have already spoken of the hungry, faint feeling in the stomach.
      Sometimes this is described as an empty, gone feeling, and here again we think of such
      remedies as <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia, Hydrastis, Sepia</font></i> and others; but <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> does not stop here with this sensation, but extends
      through the <i><font color="#0000ff">whole abdomen</font></i>. No remedy has this feeling in
      the abdomen so strong as <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>. Under stool and
      rectum occur some very characteristic symptoms also, for instance: Stools profuse, watery, <i><font color="#0000ff">pouring away as from a hydrant</font></i>, with lumps of white mucus, like <i><font color="#0000ff">grains of tallow</font></i>. Stools bloody, with small white particles like
      opaque frog-spawn. Stools involuntarily oozing from a <i><font color="#0000ff">constantly open
      anus</font></i>, or dysenteric stools with wide-open anus and <i><font color="#0000ff">great
      tenesmus</font></i>. Constipation; fæces slender, <i><font color="#0000ff">long, dry, tough
      like dog stools</font></i>. No remedy has a richer array of stool symptoms, and as we see by
      the above few select ones, some of them are very unique and have often been verified. It will
      repay any physician to carefully and frequently look them over.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy powerfully excites the sexual appetite in both sexes. It is
      almost irresistible, and leads the patient into a mania in which he will expose himself. This
      is succeeded by the opposite extreme of impotence, though the desire remains after the ability
      to perform is gone. Of course, these sexual symptoms are accompanied with concomitant symptoms
      of the drug.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the female sexual organs <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
      is true to its general hæmorrhagic tendencies; if the menses do not appear, there is often <i><font color="#0000ff">vicarious bleeding</font></i> from the nose or lungs instead. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> is <i><font color="#0000ff">bound to bleed</font></i>.
      It is so with cancer of the womb or breasts also. They bleed easily. Upon the <i><font color="#0000ff">respiratory organs</font></i> also this is one of our greatest remedies.
      Beginning with the voice and larynx, it causes and cures <i><font color="#0000ff">great</font></i>
      hoarseness. Patient can hardly make a loud noise, and is apt to be worse in the evening or
      fore-part of the night. There is <i><font color="#0000ff">pain in the larynx</font></i>, worse
      by talking, or can't talk at all on account of it. In croup, it sometimes comes in after <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconitum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i> have
      failed. The disease has progressed downward until it involves the bronchi and parenchyma of
      the lungs. It is of indispensable value here, and, also when, after the violence of the
      affection seems to have abated, the patient hoarses up every evening and seems to be <i><font color="#0000ff">inclined to relapse</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In bronchitis the cough is tight, worse from evening to midnight, also from
      <i><font color="#0000ff">speaking, laughing, reading aloud</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum met</font></i>.), <i><font color="#0000ff">cold, and lying on left
      side</font></i>. The patient suppresses the cough with a moan just as long as he can, because
      it hurts him so. The whole body <i><font color="#0000ff">trembles</font></i> with the cough.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has great oppression of breathing in both acute and chronic affections
      of the lungs. There is <i><font color="#0000ff">heaviness, as of a weight on the chest</font></i>.
      In pneumonia, for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> is one of our best
      remedies, it attacks by preference the <i><font color="#0000ff">lower half of the right lung</font></i>.
      It is apt to be indicated by the symptoms, either at the beginning of the stage of
      hepatization, when it puts a stop to the further progress of the disease, but its more
      frequent application comes in where the stage of hepatization is past and we want to break it
      up and promote absorption or resolution. Here it has no equal, as I am fully convinced by
      abundant experience.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, do not misunderstand and give the remedy blindly on a pathological
      indication only. If you do you will sometimes fail, and ought to. But I repeat, this remedy
      will oftener be found the indicated one here than any other. After the hepatization begins to
      break up, other remedies like <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic, Sulphur</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> will come in.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In pleuritis you will find stitches in the <i><font color="#0000ff">left</font></i>
      side increased by lying upon the left side. Remember in both affections <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> is characteristically increased by lying upon the left
      side.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In tuberculosis, it is oftenest indicated in the incipient stage with
      symptom of cough, oppression and general weakness already mentioned; but I have often found it
      indicated in the later stages, and if given very high and in the single dose and not repeated
      have seen it greatly benefit even incurable cases. If given too low and repeated it will
      fearfully aggravate.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One of the most characteristic symptoms of this remedy is, "<i><font color="#0000ff">feeling of intense heat running up the back</font></i>." Again the
      burning may be in spots along the spine. Also it has intense heat burning between the scapula
      (See also <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.) These, like the rest of the burning
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>, often occur in diseases of the spine and
      nervous system, but not necessarily so. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i>, these
      burnings may be purely subjective, but are none the less valuable as therapeutic indications.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another very characteristic symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
      is <i><font color="#0000ff">burning of the hands</font></i>. It is as strong as the burning
      feet of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, and is found both in acute and chronic
      diseases; cannot bear to have the hands covered. The flashes of heat all over (which <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> has) begin in the hands and spread from there even to
      the face. It now remains to call attention to the <b><font color="#ff0000">Constitution of
      Phosphorus</font></b>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1. "Tall, slender persons of sanguine temperament, fair skin, blonde
      or red hair, quick, lively perception and sensitive nature."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2. "Tall, slender phthisical patients, delicate eyelashes, soft
      hair."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">3. "Tall, slender women disposed to stoop."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">4. "Young people who grow too rapidly and are inclined to stoop."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">5. "Nervous, weak persons who like to be magnetized."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now, in number four there is not the tendency to grow fat, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea carbonica</font></i>, but tall, and you will notice that the <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> element in <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phosphorica</font></i>
      takes away the fat producing property of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>
      element.</p>
      <p align="justify">Now, in closing, we desire to say we have only touched upon the wonderful
      virtues of this drug, which must be studied in its entirety. Enough, however, we trust to
      convince of its great value.</p>
