      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is another of our wonderful remedies of which the dominant school
      knows nothing, except they have learned it from us. Its chief sphere of action seems to be in
      the abdomen and pelvis, especially in women. No remedy produces stronger symptoms here. We
      quote from different but equally good observers.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sensation of bearing down in the pelvic region, with dragging pains
      from the sacrum; or feeling of bearing down of all the pelvic organs." (Hahnemann).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Labour-like pains accompanied with a feeling as though she must cross
      her legs and 'sit close' too keep something from coming out through the vagina."
      (Guernsey).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Pain in uterus, bearing down, comes from back to abdomen, causing
      oppression of breathing; crosses limbs to prevent protrusion of parts."(Hering).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Prolapsus of the uterus, of the vagina, with pressure as if
      everything would protrude." (Lippe).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Experience has shown its value in cases of ulceration and congestion
      of the os and cervix uteri. Its use supercedes all local applications." (Dunham).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No higher authority than the united testimony of these five of our best
      observers could be brought to show the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      upon the pelvic organs.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now when we come to examine the provings in Allen's Encyclopædia, we find
      that these symptoms were mainly produced by Hahnemann and his provers, and Hahnemann advocated
      proving remedies in the 30th, and some of them were produced by the 200th, especially those
      most strongly verified by black-faced type.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We confess that we cannot understand how so many question the value of
      potencies for proving or curing, and most of all do we wonder at Dr. T. F. Allen himself
      "going back" on potencies above the 12th. Such a course looks very much to us like
      "kicking against the pricks" or, in other words, trying to fight the truth. But we
      must be charitable.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, affects
      the general circulation in a very marked manner. <i><font color="#0000ff">Flashes of heat</font></i>
      with <i><font color="#0000ff">perspiration</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">faintness</font></i>
      is almost as characteristic of this remedy as of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>.
      But there are, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>, more apt to be associated with
      them the pelvic symptoms already given, and they are also more apt to occur in connection with
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">climacteric</font></i>. Indeed, these flashes often seem with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> to start in the pelvic organs and from thence to spread over
      the body.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But this irregularity of circulation extends as far as that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. The hands and feet are hot alternately, that is, if the
      feet are hot, the hands are cold, and <i><font color="#0000ff">vice versa</font></i>. There is
      not so much <i><font color="#0000ff">sensation</font></i> of burning with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> as with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, but
      there is actual heat, and the venous congestion, which seems to be the real state of the
      organs where the pressive bearing down et cetera is left, is also accompanied with much
      throbbing and beating.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This local congestion to the pelvic organs is not simply sensational. There
      are actual displacement in consequence of it, and the long continued congestion results in
      inflammations, ulcerations, leucorrhœas and even malignant or cancerous disorganizations.
      Induration with a painful <i><font color="#0000ff">sense</font></i> of stiffness in the
      uterine region is characteristic.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This pelvic congestion also affects the rectum in a marked degree. The
      rectum prolapses, there is a sensation of fullness, or of a foreign substance as of a <i><font color="#0000ff">ball or weight</font></i>, and oozing of moisture from the rectum. Indeed, the
      rectal and anal symptoms are almost as strong as the uterine and vaginal. It is impossible to
      enumerate all the symptoms connected with the circulatory disturbances of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> in such a work as this, only a general study of the Materia
      Medica can do it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The urinary organs come in for their share of symptoms. The same pressure
      and fullness consequent upon the portal congestion reaches here. We will now proceed to give
      what we have found to be particularly valuable symptoms under the various organs in this
      region, "Pressure on bladder and frequent micturition with tension in lower
      abdomen." "Sediment in the urine like clay; as if clay was burnt on the bottom of
      the vessel; urine <i><font color="#0000ff">very offensive</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Indium</font></i>),
      can't endure to have it in the room, it is reddish or may be bloody." This is found
      mostly with women. With children there is one peculiar symptom which has often been verified.
      "The child always wets the bed during its <i><font color="#0000ff">first sleep</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the male organs I have found it particularly useful in chronic gleet.
      There is not much discharge, but a few drops, perhaps, which glue up the orifice of the
      urethra in the morning; but it is so persistent and the usual remedies will not "dry it
      up." In my early practice I used to use a weak injection of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphate
      of Zinc</font></i>, but it used to annoy me that I could not do it without resorting to local
      measures. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> does it in the majority of cases and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali iodatum</font></i> will do it in the rest. I have, where there was a
      thick discharge of long standing and the smarting and burning on urinating continued, several
      times finished the case with <i><font color="#0000ff">Capsicum</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As a rule, this long continued slight, passive gleety discharge is a result
      of weakness of the male genitals, as is shown by a flaccidity of the organs and frequent
      seminal emissions. The emissions are thin and watery. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      covers all of this and often sets all to rights in a short time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mental symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> are like <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, in that she is sad and cries frequently without knowing
      the reason why. So if in a tearful mind with uterine disturbances <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      should fail you, the next remedy to be studied is <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>.
      But there is another condition of mind not found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      or any other remedy in the same degree, and that is, that, notwithstanding there is no sign of
      dementia from actual brain lesion, the patient, contrary to her usual habit, <i><font color="#0000ff">becomes indifferent to her occupation</font></i>, her house work, her family
      or their comfort, <i><font color="#0000ff">even to those whom she loves the best</font></i>.
      This a very peculiar symptom and a genuine keynote for the exhibition of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the head <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> is one of our best
      remedies in hemicrania of women of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> temperament,
      and who are suffering from uterine trouble which we have already described. Another peculiar
      headache is, that the pain comes in <i><font color="#0000ff">terrific shocks</font></i>, so as
      to <i><font color="#0000ff">jerk</font></i> the <i><font color="#0000ff">head</font></i> in
      spite of the patient.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are three remedies that have prominently drooping eyelids (<i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum, Gelsemium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>).
      of course, the other symptoms must decide which is the one indicated in the case at hand. So
      far as the <i><font color="#0000ff">nose</font></i> is concerned <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      is often of use in chronic catarrh. I had a case in which the discharge was thick, bland and
      in large quantities. <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> would relieve the
      catarrhal trouble but would, at the same time, increase the menstrual flow too much, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> cured both. The chronic will sometimes have to be made
      between <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      in these chronic catarrhs, but it is generally easy, although the local symptoms are much
      alike.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Yellow saddle across upper part of cheeks
      and nose</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">yellow spots on the face</font></i>,"
      is a characteristic of great value, but the yellowness and yellow spots do not always stop
      here.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">You may find them in abundance on the abdomen. The whole surface of the
      body may be yellow like jaundice. The face of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      patient is the most "tell tale" face I know, and if you find it upon a woman you may
      always find her leading symptoms in connection with her menstrual and uterine functions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is one symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> upon the
      stomach that is also very characteristic, viz., a "painful sensation of emptiness, <i><font color="#0000ff">goneness</font></i> or faintness." The patient will call it an "all
      gone" feeling. Of course you remember that <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hydrastis Canadensis</font></i> have this symptom very strongly.
      Other remedies also have it in more or less marked degree but none so strongly in connection
      with uterine symptoms as <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>, unless perhaps it be <i><font color="#0000ff">Murex purpurea</font></i>, and you will not often have much difficulty in
      choosing between these last two if you carefully examine all the symptoms. I have often
      thought that this symptom, so persistent and severe, might be due to the actual emptying of
      the upper abdomen by the prolapsed womb, dragging everything after itself into the pelvic
      cavity. It is so in <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium
      tigrinum</font></i>, and the weakness of the natural supports (ligaments) of the uterus being <i><font color="#0000ff">remedied</font></i> (not supplanted by the pessaries and artificial supports
      of various kinds) the distressing symptoms disappear. <i><font color="#0000ff">Vomiting in
      pregnancy</font></i> with this "all gone" feeling is often cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>; also the <i><font color="#0000ff">thought or smell</font></i>
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Colch</font></i>.) of food sickens her. I mentioned the "sense
      of weight or a ball in the rectum" when writing of the pelvic congestion of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>. This sensation is not relieved by stool. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> is a remedy for constipation, and that of a very obstinate
      character. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Selenium</font></i> it has great straining; but
      manual aid is necessary to accomplish the stool. This is mostly in children.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once cured a very obstinate case of entero-colitis (so-called cholera
      infantum), after the complete failure of two eminent allopaths, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>,
      the leading symptom being, "<i><font color="#0000ff">always worse after taking milk</font></i>."
      Oozing of moisture from the anus finds its remedy here sometimes, but oftener in <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i>. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      patient is very weak. "A short walk fatigues her very much." She <i><font color="#0000ff">faints easily</font></i> from extremes of cold or heat, after getting wet,
      from riding in a carriage, while kneeling at church, and on other trifling occasions. This
      fainting, or sense of sinking faintness, may be found in pregnancy, child bed, or during
      lactation; or, again, it may come on after hard work, such as "laundry work;" so it
      has come to be called the "washer woman's" remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
      have washer woman's toothache.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">SKIN. "Itching often changes to burning when scratching" (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph</font></i>.) "Soreness of skin; humid places in bend of
      knees." "Brown spots in face, chest, abdomen; chloasma" Herpes circinates
      "Large suppurating pustules constantly renewing themselves." "Acarus itch,
      pruritus; tettery eruptions, etc." <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, has many forms of eruption on the skin, and indeed there
      is great general resemblance between these two antipsorics. They follow each other well. Of
      course that is always providing they are indicated by the symptoms, which is often the case. I
      do not believe in the so-called incompatibles as some do. I should give <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> after <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus, Silicea</font></i>
      after <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>, or <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>.
      after <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis mel</font></i>. if I found them <i><font color="#0000ff">indicated</font></i>.</p>

      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">MUREX PURPUREA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is a remedy which, though not extensively proven, bids fair to become
      exceedingly useful so far as we know, it comes nearer to <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      than any other remedy and the characteristic deference between them is, that with <i><font color="#0000ff">Murex</font></i> there is great, <i><font color="#0000ff">almost
      uncontrollable sexual desire</font></i>, while with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      there is a lack of or aversion to the same, especially with prolapsus.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both remedies have "<i><font color="#0000ff">sinking, all gone</font></i>"
      sensation in the stomach; also "bearing down" sensation, as if <i><font color="#0000ff">internal organs would be out, must sit and cross limbs to ameliorate the
      pressure</font></i>, but the sexual irritation and desire of <i><font color="#0000ff">Murex</font></i>
      is excited by the least contact of the parts. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Orig., Zinc</font></i>)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Murex</font></i> has a <i><font color="#0000ff">sore pain in uterus</font></i>, something like <i><font color="#0000ff">Helonias</font></i>,
      which is expressed as "conscious of a womb," feels it more when she moves, <b><font color="#ff0000">it is so sore and tender</font></b>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lyssin.</font></i>)
      Two other remedies must be remembered in nymphomania, viz, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Great bearing down, as if pelvic contents would press out through the

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sensation of constriction in heart with uterine troubles.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Depression of spirits: disposition to weep; aversion to food; indifferent
      about anything being done for her.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Lilium tigrinum is one of the remedies that closely resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> in its action on the uterine organs. This symptom, for
      instance, "<i><font color="#0000ff">weight, with feeling as if the pelvic contents would
      pass out through the vagina if not prevented by pressure with the hand</font></i> (pressing up
      against the vulva, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium tig</font></i>.), or by sitting down."
      There is no remedy that is more efficacious for uterine displacement than <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium</font></i>. The persistent bearing-down feeling in the uterine region
      of Lilium is attended with a feeling as if the pelvic viscera, indeed the whole abdominal
      contents, were being dragged downward, even from the chest and shoulders, towards the vagina.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The choice between <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> might not always be easy. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      case is more likely to be a chronic one. On the other hand, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium</font></i>
      case is more intense, painful and distressing. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      cachexia, of course, would decide easily in its favour, if it is markedly present. There is
      more urinary irritation, or frequent desire to urinate, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium</font></i>;
      indeed this is sometimes so severe as to make one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>.
      Again, rectal irritation and distress in often found in conjunction with the urinary, in this
      respect reminding one of <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. cor., Capsicum</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">With the uterine we often have quite an array of very severe heart
      symptoms. There are sharp quick pains, and much fluttering of the heart. This remedy also has
      in a marked degree the great characteristic symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus
      grandiflorus</font></i>, "<i><font color="#0000ff">sensation as if the heart were
      constricted or held by an iron band</font></i>." This symptom, associated with the many
      other heart symptoms, has sometimes led to a prescription of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i>,
      when <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium</font></i> was the remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">vice
      versa</font></i>. The uterine symptoms are sometimes masked so as to be over-looked for the
      time by the violence of the heart symptoms. All these heart, urinary, and rectal symptoms seem
      to be mainly reflex, while the real trouble is centered in the uterus and its appendages.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mind is also very markedly affected under <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium</font></i>.
      Here it may resemble <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> for tearfulness; doubts
      her salvation, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album, Sulphur</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> and a constant <i><font color="#0000ff">hurried</font></i>
      feeling, as of <i><font color="#0000ff">imperative</font></i> duties with utter inability to
      perform them. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i>.)</p>

      particularly efficacious in the neuralgic form of the disease. I have found that the symptom, <i><font color="#0000ff">pain beginning in the back and going around to loins and to uterus, ending in
      cramps there</font></i>, is the most remarkable indication. With this symptom present, I have
      seemingly checked an impending abortion, and in one case even after a slight flow of blood was
      present.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa racemosa, Chamomilla, Caulophyllum, Magnesia phos</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Viburnum</font></i> are all excellent remedies in neuralgic dysmenorrhœa. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa</font></i>, the pains are in back, through hips and down the thighs. In
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>, they make the patient mad and she says she
      cannot bear them.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">With <i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyllum</font></i> the pains are very
      intermittent and spasmodic, screams with the pains.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">With <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>, hot applications to
      the hypogastrium ameliorate more or less.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course we have many other remedies for this painful affection, among
      which are <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla, Cocculus, Cuprum, Cactus, Belladonna, Platina</font></i>,

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Secale cornutum</font></i> is a remedy capable of great good, but is
      perhaps, as much misused as Quinine. Its power to contract the uterus is undoubted, and for
      this reason it is often given when other remedies would do better. It has power to control
      hæmorrhages, that few other remedies, if any, can surpass. It is said to do this by
      contracting the capillaries. But we must remember that other remedies control hæmorrhages,
      and whether they do it by contracting the capillaries, by their action upon the blood itself
      or other specific action, makes no difference, so long as they <i><font color="#0000ff">control
      it</font></i>. Some physicians are always giving <i><font color="#0000ff">Ergot</font></i> in
      post partum hæmorrhages on this <b><font color="#ff0000">contracted</font></b> theory,
      without ever thinking of anything else.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">They always give it in material doses to get, as they term it, the <i><font color="#0000ff">physiological</font></i> effect. I have never, in a practice of thirty-five
      years, used it in this way, but have always been able to control such hæmorrhages. <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i> is not often indicated in active post-partum hæmorrhages.
      If there is a tendency to passive hæmorrhage, everything open and loose, no action, <i><font color="#0000ff">in thin, scrawny, cachectic women</font></i> (muscles flabby), there is no
      remedy like it, and the potencies are much better than the tincture or wine of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ergot</font></i> in massive doses. This is also true in menorrhagias and
      metrorrhagias unconnected with pregnancy. The blood is dark, liquid and flowing worse on the
      slightest motion.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The constitution, temperament and age of the patient are of great
      importance, for it is particularly adapted to <i><font color="#0000ff">feeble, thin, scrawny,
      cachectic women of lax muscular fibre, subject to passive hæmorrhages</font></i> from all
      outlets of the body; also old, decrepit persons.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy (<i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i>) is often abused on
      account of its power to produce muscular contractions of the womb. Now in regard to this as
      with hæmorrhages, it is capable of doing all that it ought to be called upon to do, in the
      potencies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I fully agree with Cowperthwaite, who says: "To give it in parturition
      to hasten delivery, as is the practice of the old school, is simply inexcusable." on the
      other hand, I agree with Dr. H. N. Guernsey, "that it is useful when labor pains are
      weak, suppressed or distressing, in weak, cachectic women; in the 200th dilution," and
      have verified it beyond question.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The practice of giving the fluid extract in such cases, as is done by some
      physicians calling themselves homœopathic, ought to be sufficient cause for expelling them
      from a homœopathic society. It seems to me to be confession of either inexcusable laziness or
      ignorance.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We have a long list of remedies of undoubted value for weak labor pains
      with specific indications for their use, and when so indicated they are more efficacious and
      less dangerous than <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i> in massive doses of fluid
      extract with no other indications than uncontracted uterus or weak pains. The men who prate
      learnedly of getting the <i><font color="#0000ff">physiological</font></i> effects of <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i> in massive doses had better ask themselves if the same
      result gotten with the potentized remedy homœopathically applied, is not just as much in
      accordance with the physiological law, and much more scientific from a homœopathic
      standpoint. Weak pains remedied by the indicated homœopathic drug bring on <i><font color="#0000ff">natural</font></i> labor, while large doses for the same purpose of an
      unindicated one do not and never can produce <i><font color="#0000ff">natural labor</font></i>.
      It is nothing more or less than drug poisoning.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is one symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i> that is
      of inestimable value: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Great coldness</font></i> (objective) <i><font color="#0000ff">of the surface</font></i> yet the patient cannot bear to be covered."
      This is oftenest found in cholera and cholera infantum; but it is also found in senile
      gangrene.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The feet and toes may be objectively as cold as an iron wedge, but the
      patient is distressed beyond endurance by having them covered. I saw one marked case of this
      kind. All the toes were attacked with dry gangrene. A few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i>
      (high) afforded great relief, and checked the progress of the disease for a long time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Camphora has the same symptom in a marked degree in choleraic disease. <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphora</font></i> seems to be most efficacious for the first stage or early
      collapse in the course of the disease, before the discharges have become offensive, putrid or
      dark colored. <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i> has burning in the feet (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>) and cramps in the calves (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If, however, we should prescribe on this alone it would make no difference
      which we prescribed, but they are very unlike in their entirety. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      does not have the degree of collapse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i>, nor the
      icy coldness of surface with subjective burning. So we see the folly of one symptom
      prescribing after all.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We must have the keynote symptom, of course, but it must harmonize with the
      rest of the case. Secale has "burning of all parts of the body, as if sparks were falling
      on them." It also has <i><font color="#0000ff">numbness</font></i>, crawling and
      paralysis of the extremities. This is due to its action on the spinal chord. In addition to
      the coldness of the skin already noticed, we must state that the skin looks <i><font color="#0000ff">dry</font></i>, wrinkled and is insensible often, or there may be much <i><font color="#0000ff">formication</font></i> under, as if mice were creeping there.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is another very valuable "woman remedy," because of its specific
      action upon the uterus. It deserves a thorough reproving. I cannot better show its virtues
      than by reporting a case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A married lady, aged 40, with wry neck of long standing, was seven months'
      pregnant. She was attacked with <i><font color="#0000ff">severe pains and swelling of all the
      finger joints</font></i>. The only way she could get relief from the intense pain so that she
      could rest or sleep at all was by enveloping her fingers in mustard. I prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyllum</font></i> 3d, which relieved the finger pains, but brought on
      such severe labor pains that I was obliged to discontinue it for fear of premature labor. Then
      the bearing-down pains ceased, and the finger pains returned and continued in full force until
      she was delivered of her child, when they also ceased for two or three days. Then the lochia,
      instead of decreasing, gradually or normally, increased until it amounted to a metrorrhagia. <i><font color="#0000ff">The flow was of a passive nature, dark and liquid</font></i>. There was great
      sense of weakness and <i><font color="#0000ff">internal trembling</font></i> (not visible
      externally) and now, to crown her suffering, the terrible finger pains returned again. I was
      afraid of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyllum</font></i>, although it seemed indicated,
      because it brought on the bearing-down pains when I gave it before. But after giving <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica, Sabina, Secale</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      without the least improvement, I concluded to try <i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyllum high</font></i>.
      I did so in the 200th potency and cured the whole case promptly and permanently. Now this was
      a perfect <i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyllum</font></i> case, and if I had given it
      properly in the first place I have no doubt I would have saved that woman all unnecessary
      suffering.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have given this remedy in long continued passive hæmorrhage from the
      uterus after miscarriage when I had the characteristic weakness and sense of <i><font color="#0000ff">internal trembling</font></i> present. It has often regulated irregular
      spasmodic labor pains, and has also often relieved pains of the same character in dysmenorrhœa.
      I repeat, this remedy deserves a careful reproving.</p>

      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa racemosa</font></i> is another remedy which exerts a strong
      influence upon the female organism. The nervous system manifests its action in a multitude of
      symptoms, many of them being what is known as hysterical in character. There are twitchings,
      spasms, convulsions, neuralgias and mental symptoms in abundance. She shivers (nervous chill
      without coldness), faints, talks incessantly, frequently changing subjects; is grieved and
      troubled, with sighing, or is <i><font color="#0000ff">very gloomy with sleeplessness</font></i>;
      thinks she is going insane, etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In the head there are severe pains, <i><font color="#0000ff">pressing

      <p align="JUSTIFY">In the female sexual organs it cures "pains in the uterine region,
      darting from side to side." The menstrual function is performed irregularly. Sometimes
      the flow is scanty, but more generally profuse, and we have the mental and nervous symptoms
      above enumerated in abundance, with these irregularities. It is one of our best remedies in
      menorrhagia, when there is "<i><font color="#0000ff">severe pain in the back, down the
      thighs and through the hips, with heavy pressing down</font></i>," as I have often
      proven. It is also excellent in <i><font color="#0000ff">infra-mammary pains in the left side</font></i>
      during the climacteric, as I have also proven.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Also in backache and spinal irritation sympathetic with uterine troubles.
      It cures sharp lancinating pains in various parts, either nervous or muscular, if they are
      connected with uterine disturbances. In rheumatism the affection attacks the <i><font color="#0000ff">belly of the muscle</font></i> by preference. <i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa</font></i>
      is a many-sided remedy and adapted to nervous troubles of many forms.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">SABINA.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is one of our best remedies for profuse flowing from the female genital
      organs, as in menorrhagia, metrorrhagia, abortions, or after labor.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These hæmorrhages are apt to occur in paroxysms, worse from motion (<i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i>), blood dark (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali nit</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cyclamen</font></i>), and clotted (<i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i>)
      or partly clotted and partly fluid and watery (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum</font></i>),
      the clots being black; from loss of tone in the uterus; (<i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyl</font></i>.)
      after abortion or parturition, with <i><font color="#0000ff">pain from back to pubes</font></i>.
      This pain from back to pubes is its grand keynote, and may be found, not only in flooding, but
      in threatened abortion and menstrual troubles generally. Where is sometimes present the
      general characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, "aggravation
      from warm air and in a warm room, and amelioration in open, cool, fresh air," and in
      cases of too profuse menstruation; but you cannot give <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      because it increases the already too profuse flow. Here is where <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabina</font></i>
      comes in, for it has the same aggravation and amelioration <i><font color="#0000ff">with</font></i>
      the profuse flow. This is an important diagnostic difference between the two remedies and is
      reliable.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Sabina</font></i> is indicated in threatened abortion at the third month,
      especially if the characteristic pain from back to pubes is present. If the pains begin in the
      back and go around from there and end with cramps in the uterus, <i><font color="#0000ff">Viburnum
      opulus</font></i> is the remedy. This kind of pain seems as characteristic for <i><font color="#0000ff">Viburnum</font></i> as is the other for <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabina</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Sabina</font></i> has arthritic swelling of the wrist joint; also of the
      toe joints. This, if occurring in conjunction with its profuse flow from the genitals, may
      make the choice of remedy lie between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyllum</font></i>
      in some cases. The ovaries sympathize very much with the uterine troubles of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabina</font></i>, especially after abortion, or suppressed gonorrhœa, or

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have found this remedy of use in a generally debilitated condition of
      women, with many and various complaints or symptoms in the region of the uterus, for instance:
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Prolapsus from atony</font></i>, enervated by indolence and luxury; <i><font color="#0000ff">worn out with hard work, mental or physical</font></i>; muscles burn and ache;
      so tired cannot sleep (Dr. H. C. Allen).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is almost always associated with it a more or less anæmic condition.
      This. anæmia may seem to be consequent upon too profuse menstruation or flooding, or it may
      exist entirely independent of any such cause. In these cases I have often found albumen
      present in the urine, sometimes in large quantities especially in pregnant women, and seen
      rapid improvement and disappearance of the albumen under the action of this remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The fact that these anæmic and debilitated states are found, both under
      profuse and scanty discharges of the uterine organs, seems to indicate that the local symptoms
      are secondary, or a consequence of general debility and impoverished blood. Again, the fact
      that <i><font color="#0000ff">Helonias</font></i> cures both conditions equally well seems to
      corroborate it.</p>
      <p align="justify">What are the symptoms? The <i><font color="#0000ff">leading</font></i>
      symptoms are anæmia, great general weakness and languor, and great lowness of spirits or
      profound melancholy. This condition of mind is temporarily relieved by diversion. She is
      always better if she can get her mind off herself; dragging weakness in sacral region; various
      displacements of womb, but more especially prolapses; pain in the back, with lameness,
      stiffness and weight, and heat or burning in lumbar region; back feels tired and weak;
      continual <i><font color="#0000ff">consciousness of a womb</font></i>, it is so <i><font color="#0000ff">sore and tender</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Pirogen</font></i>
      -distinct consciousness of a heart). Now this condition and these symptoms are often found at
      the age of puberty, during pregnancy and after labor, and here <i><font color="#0000ff">Helonias</font></i>
      is indeed a blessing. I have found it efficacious in the 2d and the 30th, according to
      susceptibility of the patient. <i><font color="#0000ff">Helonias</font></i> deserves a
      thorough proving in the potencies. Compare with <i><font color="#0000ff">Aletris</font></i>.</p>
