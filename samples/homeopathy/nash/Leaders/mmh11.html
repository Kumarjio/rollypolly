      <p align="CENTER">ERIGERON, TRILLIUM, MILLEFOLIUM.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Are three remedies having a reputation for their power to control
      hæmorrhages. <i><font color="#0000ff">Erigeron</font></i> has cured epistaxis, with
      congestion to the head, red face (<i><font color="#0000ff">Melilotus</font></i>) and febrile
      action. Hæmatemesis, with violent retching and burning in the stomach. Bleeding from
      hæmorrhoids, with burning. Hæmoptysis and blood spitting. Hæmaturia, with stone in the
      bladder and uterine hæmorrhage. The only marked symptom in addition to the hæmorrhage that
      should lead to its selection over other remedies of this class, especially in its hæmorrhages
      from the pelvic organs, is the marked violent <i><font color="#0000ff">irritation of the
      rectum</font></i> and bladder. Here we must remember also <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis,
      Lilium tig</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Trillium</font></i>, from clinical use, seems to be a genuine hæmorrhage
      remedy. The blood is bright red, whether of the active or passive kind of hæmorrhage. It is
      especially useful in <b><font color="#ff0000">menses every two weeks</font></b>, <i><font color="#0000ff">lasting a week and very profuse</font></i>. Here a choice may have to be made
      between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ost</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">China in flooding, with fainting, dim
      sight</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">noises in the ears</font></i>. Of course, <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> would be the best for the after effects of such a
      hæmorrhage.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is sometimes with such flooding a relaxed sensation as if the hips,
      sacro-synchrondroses and small of back would <i><font color="#0000ff">all fall apart</font></i>;
      wants to be <i><font color="#0000ff">bound together</font></i>. This should doubly indicate it
      in post-partum hæmorrhage.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is also especially useful at the climacteric with the above symptoms. It
      has cured hæmorrhages from other organs, but I have no experience with it there.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Millefolium</font></i> is the only one of the three that has seemed to have
      <i><font color="#0000ff">produced</font></i> hæmorrhages in its pathogenesis. Hahnemann says
      of it: "<i><font color="#0000ff">It causes nose-bleed</font></i>. It causes
      hæmaturia." Clinical use has verified it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The blood from the different organs is generally bright red, like that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>, but the anxiety of that remedy is not there. In fact, no
      great fear is present in the cases where I have used it. Sometimes the blood in the urine
      forms in the bottom of the vessel a <i><font color="#0000ff">bloody cake</font></i>. When a
      young man I was troubled for a long time with frequent attacks of profuse epistaxis. Dr. T. L
      Brown prescribed for me several times, but without success. I became weak from loss of blood.
      Finally my old grandmother told me to chew yarrow root, and showed me the plant growing in my
      father's yard. I did so and was quickly cured. While on my vacation at Blue Mountain Lake, in
      the Adirondacks, I met a man there in the last stage of consumption. He had his medicine from
      his doctor in New York with him. He was spitting daily large quantities of blood, with severe
      cough, and his <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i> was nor able to control it in the
      least. He finally said to me: "Doctor, can you do anything to stop this bleeding?" I
      stooped down (I did not want that patient on my hands) and pulled up a little root of yarrow
      growing at our feet, handed it to him and told him to chew it. He looked surprised, but did
      so, liked the taste of it and kept on chewing. It stopped his bleeding and soothed his cough
      so much that he dug up a basket of yarrow and took it home with him. That controlled the
      bleeding. He went to Florida for the winter, but died the next spring. It is especially
      recommended for hæmorrhages after a fall or other injuries. If <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>
      failed in such a case I would think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Millefolium</font></i>.</p>

      pulse.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Very much has been said and written upon this as a heart remedy: It is
      called a cardiac tonic, but Homœopathy knows no such thing as a tonic in medicines. The only
      tonic, in the sense of something to impart strength or tone to the human organism, is
      nourishing food. If <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i> is capable of correcting a
      diseased condition, it does so by opposing its own power to cure to the power that is making
      the patient <i><font color="#0000ff">sick</font></i>, which is called disease.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The leading characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>
      is a <i><font color="#0000ff">every slow pulse</font></i>. This may alternate with a very
      quick pulse, and between the two <i><font color="#0000ff">we may</font></i> sometimes get a
      very irregular or intermittent pulse.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One day I saw an old but very strong man staggering across the road toward
      my office. I thought he was drunk, but on closer observation I noticed that his face looked
      purple, his lips bluish, and I stepped out and helped him in. He sat down and could not for a
      few minutes speak a word, but sat and struggled for breath. His pulse was very irregular and
      intermittent. When he could speak, he told me that for a number of weeks past he had been
      having these spells, had fallen several times and been obliged to go into the stores and sit,
      before he could go along the streets. Auscultation revealed hard, blowing sound with first
      beat of the heart. He had had inflammatory rheumatism in his younger days. He had been obliged
      to give up all manual labor and dared not go away from home on his business, that of bridge
      builder. Said he expected to die with this heart disease. I gave him <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>
      2, a few drops in water. In a few days I saw him shoveling snow from the walk in front of his
      dwelling. "Hello," he said, "I have no heart disease;" and I saw him often
      after that and he told me that that medicine cured him of "those spells."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A young man of good habits was taken with nausea and vomiting. He was
      drowsy, and after a couple of days he began to grow very jaundiced all over. The sclerotica
      were as yellow as gold, as was indeed, the skin all over the body, even to the nails. The
      stools were natural as to consistence, <i><font color="#0000ff">but perfectly colorless</font></i>,
      while the urine was as <i><font color="#0000ff">brown as lager beer</font></i>, or even more
      so. Where you could see through it, on the edge of the receptacle, it was yellow as fresh
      bile. The pulse was only <i><font color="#0000ff">thirty beats per minute</font></i>, and
      often dropped out a beat.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This was a perfect <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i> case of
      jaundice, and this remedy cure him perfectly in a few days, improvement in his feelings taking
      place very shortly after beginning it; the stools, urine and skin gradually taking on their
      natural color. The characteristic slow pulse was the leading symptom to the prescription, for
      all the rest of the symptoms may be found in almost any well-developed case of severe
      jaundice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In dropsies, consequent on heart disease, <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>
      is often the remedy, and in these cases the skin is more apt to be bluish, as from venous
      stagnation, than in those cases dependent on renal disease.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the troubles consequent upon weak heart action with slow pulse that
      are particularly amenable to <i><font color="#0000ff">digitalis</font></i> are vertigo (this
      is often found in the aged); dropsy of brain, chest, abdomen or scrotum; passive congestion of
      the lungs.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the more characteristic symptoms, aside from the slow pulse, are:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Blueness of skin, especially eyelids, lips, tongue, and nails;
      cyanosis."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Faintness or sinking at stomach; feel as if he were dying."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Sensation as if the heart would stop beating if she moved."
      (Gelsemium, if she did <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> keep moving. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lobelia</font></i>, as if it would cease any way).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Respiration irregular, difficult, performed by frequent deep

      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus grandiflorus</font></i> is another great heart remedy, and its grand
      characteristic is not at all like <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>. It is a

      chest, bladder, rectum, uterus, vagina; in short, it seems to be a general characteristic for
      this remedy, as does that of <i><font color="#0000ff">fullness</font></i> for <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus hippocastanum</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The heart troubles of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i> are quite
      apt to be caused by inflammatory rheumatism, where it is one of our best remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Among the symptoms found, more or less connected with heart troubles, for
      which <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i> is indicated, are: Heavy pain on vertex like
      a weight (<i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>; <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      at climacteric), a frequent symptom in persons suffering with heart troubles, cerebral
      congestion, profuse epistaxis, hæmatemesis, hæmorrhages from anus, hæmaturia or

      on the heart, we have other chest and heart symptoms which are very valuable. Oppression of

      <p align="JUSTIFY">In this we have another valuable, heart remedy. The pains in the heart in
      this remedy are as severe as those under <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i> and the
      action is more violent than under either <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>. It is so violent as often to be <i><font color="#0000ff">visible
      to the eye through the clothes, shaking the whole chest, and the sounds are often audible
      several inches away</font></i>. It is not only a very valuable remedy in acute attacks of the
      heart but in chronic valvular affections following the acute attack, where we have the loud
      blowing sounds and <i><font color="#0000ff">attacks of violent palpitation</font></i>. I have
      seen the violent attacks of palpitation quickly relieved, and not only that, but the valvular
      troubles gradually and perfectly cured, under the action of this remedy. In these troubles the
      patient can often only lie on <i><font color="#0000ff">the right side</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phos., Nat. mur</font></i>.), <i><font color="#0000ff">or with the head very
      high</font></i>; least motion &lt; (<i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i>). It is one of
      our best remedies for neuralgic affections of the head, face, and eyes.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The headaches are generally one-sided, beginning in the occiput and
      extending forward, and settling over the left eye (right, <i><font color="#0000ff">Sang</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>). They are aggravated by the least noise or
      jar. They <i><font color="#0000ff">increase with the rising of the sun and decrease with its
      going down</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur., Tabacum</font></i>), and the eye
      on the affected side often runs clear water. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidon. maj</font></i>.,
      right side with water gushing out).</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i> is very useful in ciliary neuralgia, the pain being of
      the same character as the headaches. The pains are also stabbing, running through into the
      back of the head, or like <i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa</font></i>, they press outward, as
      if the eyeballs were too large for the sockets (<i><font color="#0000ff">Comocladia</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In any or all of the above-named affections, for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i> is so efficacious, the patient is made worse from motion,
      noise, inspiration or moving the eyes, and especially in <i><font color="#0000ff">cold, damp,
      rainy weather</font></i>. It makes us think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia, Kalmia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>., and <i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa</font></i>
      (motion), <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> (noise), and <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
      (touch, especially light touch). It is certainly a very valuable remedy, though not one, so
      far as known, of very wide range of action.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Ought to be noticed just here, because it seems, at first sight, so much
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>, and Hering says it follows <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i> well in heart disease.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both remedies have severe neuralgia of the face, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i> is oftenest right-sided, <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>
      left. Both have pains in eyes, worse on turning them, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>
      has a sense of stiffness (<i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.). <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i> eyes
      hurt as if too large for the orbit. Both affect strongly the heart, and are useful in heart
      troubles of rheumatic origin. Both have violent, visible, tumultuous action of heart; <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i> is invariably so, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>
      has at times remarkable <i><font color="#0000ff">slowness</font></i> of the pulse (like <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>). The <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i> form of
      rheumatism, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i>, goes from above downward (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> from below upward), and the pains in <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>
      shift suddenly. If we were called to a case of migratory rheumatism, and the heart seemed to
      be suffering, we would think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i> before <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, of course all the <i><font color="#0000ff">other</font></i>
      symptoms taken into consideration. The pain of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>
      often extends down to left hand (<i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So far as the neuralgic symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>
      are concerned, they are not much like <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>, except
      that they locate in the face, and are very violent. The sides and time of aggravation are
      different, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i> is not often found involving the
      whole head, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>. Hering mentions that with <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i> "weakness is the only <i><font color="#0000ff">general</font></i>
      symptom with neuralgia" The neuralgic pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>
      are sometimes attended with, or followed by, <b><font color="#ff0000">numbness</font></b> of

      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> leads all the remedies for <i><font color="#0000ff">nausea</font></i>.
      Any complaint accompanied with persistent nausea, the patient not being at all relieved by
      vomiting, just as sick after as before-this is what we mean by <i><font color="#0000ff">persistent</font></i>
      nausea. This should at once call attention to this remedy. It is often found in connection
      with gastric troubles from dietetic errors, and the choice will sometimes be between <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>,
      because both are useful in gastric disturbances caused by indulgence in mixed diet -pastry,
      ice-cream, pork, fatty food, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> may be
      considered the better, while the food is <i><font color="#0000ff">in</font></i> the stomach. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> after it is <i><font color="#0000ff">out</font></i>,
      but the nausea persists notwithstanding.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> the tongue is
      often coated, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i>, while with <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> there may be a slight coating, or the tongue may be
      perfectly clean. This vomiting with clean tongue, however, is not an infallible indication for
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i>, for we sometimes find it in connection with
      worm symptoms, where <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> has it just as prominently, and
      is the remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i> also has it in heart disease. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> affects the whole intestinal tract. One very
      characteristic symptom is that the stomach and bowels feel as if <i><font color="#0000ff">relaxed</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">hanging down</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are three kinds of looseness of the bowels, or rather three
      characteristic stools:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1. Fermented stools-foamy, like yeast.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2. Grass-green stools -mucous or watery.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">3. Slimy stools -dysenteric, with more or less blood.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All these stools are found very often in children, especially in summer
      time, often as a consequence of overeating or wrong eating, when a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> 200th will set matters to rights, and prevent the
      little patient from running into so-called cholera-infantum or enterocolitis, which often
      becomes a very serious and obstinate affection. The characteristic nausea is a sure
      indication.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We will also find this nausea present, where this remedy is the
      "proper caper," in <i><font color="#0000ff">headaches</font></i>. Headache, as if
      bruised, all through the bones of the head, and down into the root of the tongue. This kind of
      headache may be of rheumatic origin, but the nausea is there just the same, if <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> is to cure. Then we have a sick headache of gastric
      origin, the nausea beginning before the pain in the head, and continuing all through. In what
      seems to be hydrocephaloid with this nausea, <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i>
      has often cleared up the whole case in a few hours.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, we find the nausea accompanying the cough in the affections of the
      respiratory organs. Also in the hæmorrhages and in the fevers in which it is often indicated.
      In short, we cannot do better than to use Hering's expression: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Nausea,
      distressing, constant, with almost all complaints, as if from the stomach, with empty
      eructations, accumulation of much saliva, qualmishness and efforts to vomit</font></i>," <b><font color="#ff0000">nothing relieves</font></b>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">During the nausea, the face is generally pale, eyes sunken, with blue
      margins, and often there is more or less twitching of face and lips, and sleepiness after
      vomiting. We have a great many remedies that are powerful emetics, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tartaricum, Zinc sulphate, Lobelia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Apomorphine</font></i>; but, so far as I know, the nausea is not so
      persistent, nor is it found in connection with so many other affections. Of course, no single
      symptom, however strong, would justify a prescription, if there were other symptoms just as
      strong in the same case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">For instance, if there were burning in the stomach, intense thirst, but
      could not drink, great restlessness and prostration, we would think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum album</font></i>, and it is often the best remedy to follow <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac</font></i>., if the case goes from bad to worse.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> affects the mucous lining of the respiratory organs,
      almost as prominently as it does that of the alimentary tract.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is a great accumulation of mucus, which loads up the air cells and
      bronchi, until there seems to be great danger of suffocation. Note the symptoms:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Violent degree of dyspnœa, with wheezing
      and great weight and anxiety about the prœcordia</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Antimon.
      tart</font></i>., coarse rattling.) "Threatened suffocation from accumulation of
      mucus."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This excessive accumulation of mucus in the air passages seems to excite
      spasm like a foreign body, and an asthma, or spasmodic cough, or both together, ensue. But the
      spasmodic cough and asthma do not seem to all depend upon accumulation of mucus, for <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> is often our best remedy in the first stage of both
      asthma and whooping cough, before the stage when the mucus is present.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, "<i><font color="#0000ff">Suffocating cough, whereby the child
      becomes quite stiff and blue in the face</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Whooping cough, with nosebleed (<i><font color="#0000ff">Indigo</font></i>),
      <i><font color="#0000ff">bleeding from the mouth, vomiting, loses breath, turns pale or blue,
      and becomes rigid</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Infantile pneumonia. with chest loaded with mucus, rapid, wheezing
      respiration, surface blue, face pale, finds a very effectual remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i>. Old people with emphysema form chronic asthma are also
      &gt; by <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac</font></i>. So that we might narrow down the
      respiratory troubles to two conditions:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st, Those in which excessive accumulation of mucus characterized the case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2nd, Those in which spasm was the characteristic feature.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course, all the symptoms must be taken into consideration, in order to
      differentiate between <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> and other remedies
      having the same objective states and conditions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The control that this remedy has over hæmorrhages deserves honorable
      mention It has hæmorrhages from the nose, stomach, rectum, womb, lungs and bladder; from all
      the orifices of the body. So does <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus,</font></i> but the blood
      in <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> is <i><font color="#0000ff">bright red</font></i>,
      not decomposed. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i> also has hæmorrhages from
      all the outlets of the body, but the other attending symptoms are different. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i>, the hæmorrhages are active, profuse, bright red. It
      is a better remedy than <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i> ever was or can be, for
      post-partum hæmorrhages, and it is not necessary to use it in large and poisonous doses, for
      it will stop them in the 200th potency, and is quicker in its action than <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale</font></i>. Let us notice a few remedies for hæmorrhages:</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Other remedies and indications might be added here, but hæmorrhage is only
      one symptom, and never alone furnishes a reliable indication for any remedy. But <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> is one of the best <i><font color="#0000ff">if
      indicated</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i> is a well-known intermittent fever remedy in our
      school. Jahr recommends it in the beginning of all cases, unless there are special indications
      for some other remedy, and says "By pursuing this course I have cured many cases of fever
      and ague by the first prescription, thus saving myself a good deal of unnecessary seeking and
      comparing." Whatever may be said in condemnation of this loose prescribing, it is
      certainly preferable to the inevitable Quinine prescription of the old school, and some
      self-styled homœopaths, for the reason that it will <i><font color="#0000ff">cure</font></i>
      more cases than Quinine, and do infinitely less harm. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac</font></i>.
      can cure more cases than Quinine, but both can cure the case to which they are homœopathic,
      and that in the potentized form of the drug. We have such clear-cut indications for the use of
      many remedies that we need not fail once where the allopaths do twenty times, with their
      indiscriminate Quinine treatment.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The whole case generally revolves around one to three guiding symptoms, for
      instance: <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac</font></i>. The persistent nausea in one or all
      stages.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum alb</font></i>. Irregularly developed paroxysm; thirst intense

      sweat &gt;; after Quinine.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. Cough in chill; restless and dry tongue in heat;
      tossing about.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>. Great loquacity during chill and heat; jaundice.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">These characteristics are genuine and reliable, and many more might be
      added if we had time and space, but they can all be found in H C Allen's work on <i><font color="#0000ff">Fevers</font></i>. They show how different the remedies, and how particular
      the true prescriber must be, when selecting his remedy for this, as well as other diseases.
      Remittents also often come under the control of this remedy.</p>

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tartaricum</font></i> is another powerful emetic. I can remember
      the time when the old allopaths used it almost as generally as the botanics did <i><font color="#0000ff">Lobelia inflata</font></i>, to "clean out the stomach." Now-a-days,
      washing out the stomach by lavage, and the rectum and colon by enemas, according to
      "Hall's method," is quite fashionable, and is withal much more sensible, inasmuch as
      they are so lame in their therapeutics.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding these improvements, there is still a great deal of
      "gut scraping" going on in the name of "cleaning out the system," as
      though the alimentary canal was not a self-cleaning institution, if kept, or put into a
      healthy condition, but must be regularly "gone through" once in about so often, on
      the "house cleaning" principle. To be sure it is folly, but they do the best they
      know. Neither <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tart</font></i>. nor any other emetic is
      used by us for emetic purposes from a therapeutic standpoint.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Our therapeutic uses of it are the same as those of any other remedy, on
      the principle of <i><font color="#0000ff">similia similibus curantur</font></i>. The nausea of
      this remedy is as intense as that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecacuanha</font></i>, but not
      so persistent, and there is relief after vomiting. I have found it nearest a specific (of
      course we know there is no absolute specific for any disease) for cholera morbus of any
      remedy. For more than twenty-five years, I have seldom found it necessary to use any other,
      and then only when there were severe cramps in the stomach and bowels, when <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum metallicum</font></i> relieved.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has the nausea, vomiting, loose stools, prostration, cold sweat, and
      stupor or drowsiness found in almost all bad cases of this disease, and I have seldom been
      obliged to give more than two or three doses, one after each vomiting, before the case was
      relieved. It is not generally recommended in the text-books for this ailment, but is a gem, as
      I know from abundant experience and observation.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tart</font></i>. possessed only the
      one power of curing, that it does upon the respiratory organs, it would be indispensable. No
      matter what the <i><font color="#0000ff">name</font></i> of the trouble, whether it be
      bronchitis, pneumonia, whooping cough or asthma, if there is great accumulation of mucus with <i><font color="#0000ff">coarse rattling</font></i>, or filling up with it, but, at the same time,
      there seems to be inability to raise it, <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i> is
      the first remedy to be thought of. This is true in all ages and constitutions, but
      particularly so in children and old people.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is one symptom that is very apt to be present in these cases, and
      that is, <i><font color="#0000ff">great drowsiness</font></i> or sleepiness, sometimes
      amounting to coma. This is found, not only in diseases of the respiratory organs, but in
      cholera infantum, cholera morbus and intermittent fever. In pneumonia, both <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> may
      have great sleepiness but there is no need for any confusion here as to choice, for in <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>; the face is dark red or purple, and there may be sighing or
      stertorous respiration. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i> the face is
      always pale, or cyanotic, with no redness, and the breathing is not stertorous.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Three remedies are remarkable for sleepiness, viz.: <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium; Tartar emetic</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i>,
      but aside from this one symptom they are not alike. <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tart.</font></i>
      is also one of our best remedies for hepatization of lungs remaining after pneumonia. There is
      dullness on percussion, and lack or absence of respiratory murmur, and shortness of breath,
      and patient continues pale, weak and sleepy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> should not promote
      absorption in such a case, <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i> will often do it.
      I have used it from the 200th to the c. m. potencies with equally good results.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Burning of mouth, tongue, throat, clear down into stomach, and of anus if
      there is diarrhœa.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Vomiting of stringy, glairy, ropy mucus; hangs in strings down to
      receptacle on the floor.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Gastric or hepatic sick headaches with blur before the eyes at the

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Iris is another remedy which causes great nausea and vomiting. It is
      sometimes very serviceable in cholera infantum. The substance vomited is generally very <i><font color="#0000ff">sour</font></i>, so sour that it excoriates the throat.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The gastric troubles of this remedy are often accompanied with a <i><font color="#0000ff">burning of tongue, throat</font></i>, œsophagus and stomach, and, if
      diarrhœa is present, with burning of the anus. This burning of the alimentary canal is very
      characteristic of this drug.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The vomiting is <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> always sour, but
      may be bitter or sweetish There is also profuse flow of saliva. I once had a case of stomach
      trouble in a middle-aged lady. She had frequent attacks of vomiting of a stringy, glairy mucus
      which was very ruby, would hang in strings from her mouth to the receptacle on the floor. Then
      the substance vomited became dark-colored; like coffee grounds. She became very weak, vomited
      all nourishment. She also had profuse secretion of ropy saliva. Thinking she had cancer of the
      stomach, she made her will and set her house in order, to die. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      bichromicum</font></i> was given with no benefit whatever, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Iris</font></i>
      cured her completely in a short time and she remains well ten years since.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="justify"><i><font color="#0000ff">Iris</font></i> is also one of our best remedies for sick headache. These
      headaches seem to be of gastric or hepatic origin, and often begin with a blur before the
      eyes. I used to give the remedy in the 3d.; but of late years have given it in the 50m. and am
      better pleased with the result, because it is more prompt and lasting. It is recommended in
      sciatica, but I have had no experience with it in this affection It seems to act most
      powerfully upon the alimentary tract. I have never used it in skin troubles.</p>
