      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sick headache. Pain commences in the back of the head, rises and spreads
      over the head, and settles down over the right eye (left eye, <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>),
      with nausea and vomiting; patient wants to be in a dark room and perfectly quiet. I have made
      some fine cures in long-standing cases of habitual sick headaches of this kind with this
      remedy. It will probably cure, or greatly relieve, the ordinary American sick headache as
      often as any other remedy. I use the 200th. <i><font color="#0000ff">Loose cough, with badly
      smelling sputa; the breath and sputa smelling badly to the patient himself</font></i>. There
      is sometimes a pain behind the sternum (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroid</font></i>.).
      This kind of cough usually comes on after a severe bronchitis or pneumonia, and it looks as
      though the patient were fast running into consumption. There may also be flushes of fever with
      circumscribed redness of the cheeks, like hectic fever. Many a case of this kind has been
      helped by this remedy. Dr. T. L Brown used the first trituration of the alkaloid with fine
      effect. The 200th has made just as good cures. In typhoid pneumonia with great dyspnœa and
      circumscribed redness of the cheeks, <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanguinaria</font></i> has, in
      my hands, done good service. The right lung seems to come markedly under its influence, either
      in acute or chronic troubles. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Rheumatic pain in right arm and
      shoulder, worse at night in bed, cannot raise the arm</font></i>." This condition has
      often been relieved by this remedy in my hands and has won me much credit. I have seen <i><font color="#0000ff">one dose</font></i> of the first trituration cure such cases of long standing.
      I have seen the c. m. do the same thing. Flashes of heat, with hot palms and soles, at the
      climacteric find a remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanguinaria</font></i>. Sometimes
      indicated after <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The leading characteristic of this remedy lies in its effects upon the
      sensorium. "<i><font color="#0000ff">He lies in a stupor or in a stupid sleep,
      unconscious of all that is going on around him, but when aroused is fully conscious</font></i>."
      This is <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> in its intensest degree, as found
      in typhoid fever, in which it is one of our best remedies. But it is not alone here that the
      sensorial depression appears. It may he found in a lesser degree, in the results of depressing
      emotions, like grief at the loss of a friend, lover, property or position, and the effect
      seems to be even deeper rooted than in those cases which call for <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>.
      (See also <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>.) The subject seems <b><font color="#ff0000">stupefied</font></b> with grief. There is not, the nervous twitching of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>, but a settled despair, general weakness or prostration.
      The hair turns gray, and a weary, worn and haggard, hopeless look obtains. I have succeeded in
      curing such a case when <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> failed. In such a case the
      patient sometimes complains of a pain like a <i><font color="#0000ff">crushing weight on the
      vertex</font></i>, or, again, of pain in the occiput or nape of the neck, and with both they
      appear physically weak, or exhausted, want to lie down, don't want company, or to be noticed
      or spoken to. We often find this sensorial depression in connection with the effects of
      onanism or excessive coition. The patient is disturbed by the culpability of his indulgence,
      grieves over it, is inclined to sink into despair. This is true of both sexes, and the
      depression is much worse if the patient is <i><font color="#0000ff">growing</font></i> too
      fast, or is overtaxed mentally or physically. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea carb</font></i>.
      they grow too fat, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> too fast and tall.
      We have in <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> a remedy for the headache of
      students, especially of those who are growing, too fast. It is a sin to keep such young people
      bowing down to hard study, and while it is true that youth is the time to get an education it
      is also true that it is the time when too great a strain in that direction may utterly wreck
      and forever incapacitate a mind which might, with more time and care, have been a blessing to
      the world.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>, properly
      exhibited, may be of incalculable benefit in such cases. It will sometimes be a choice between
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      muriaticum</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phos</font></i>., the other
      symptoms must decide.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In regard to the use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>
      in typhoids, there are no other remedies exactly like it in its depressing effect on the
      sensorium. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> has its apathy or indifference; but the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> depression is more profound, as is also that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>, for they both go to sleep while answering a question,
      showing how overpowering is the stupor. Then with the former we have petechiæ or ecchymosis,
      which is not found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>, and under the,
      latter the tendency to, decomposition of the fluids as found in the terribly offensive stools
      and urine.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> surpasses them all in its stupefying powers, and the face,
      breathing and general appearance, is not at all, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i> are
      very stupid also, but in other respects are very different. The description of these remedies
      is found under each, as we have written of their use in typhoids. <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      moschata</font></i> ought also to be mentioned in this connection.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We must not forget the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>
      upon the bowels. It does not exhibit any peculiar characteristic action upon the stomach, but
      does in the abdominal region, as the following well-verified symptoms show: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Meteoristic distention of the abdomen; rumbling and gurgling and noise as from
      watery, painless stools</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Diarrhœa</font></i> <b><font color="#ff0000">white</font></b><i><font color="#0000ff">, or yellow, watery, chronic or
      acute, without pain or any marked debility or exhaustion</font></i>." Now, it seems very
      singular that, after so much talk about the general depression or weakness of this remedy, we
      should be obliged to record that the profuse and sometimes long-continued diarrhœa should <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> debilitate, as a characteristic symptom. Well, there are a good
      many unaccountable things, in both disease and therapeutics, and this is one of them, but the <i><font color="#0000ff">fact</font></i> remains and we act upon it. Let us remember that the profound
      weakness and depression of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> is upon the <i><font color="#0000ff">sensorium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">nervous</font></i> system,
      and will be there whether diarrhœa is present or not. It is markedly so in typhoids, as I can
      fully attest from abundant observation. <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> debilitates
      by its diarrhœa or loss of fluids generally. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>
      attacks the nervous system primarily, even in onanism, and its results or effects are not so
      much the loss of semen as a vital fluid, as under <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>,
      the nervous system suffering very much, even though the emissions be neither very frequent nor
      profuse.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Young boys even suffer from the effects of the <i><font color="#0000ff">orgasm</font></i>
      of onanism before there is much or any semen secreted. This is well to remember in a choice
      between these two remedies. There is a condition in which I have found this remedy very
      valuable, especially in men. The leading symptom is a "weak feeling in the chest from
      talking." You remember <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i> has this symptom very
      strongly (also <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>) and may lead us into a wrong
      prescription if only the one symptom were considered. If the patient is a young man, married
      or single; if, again, he seems weak in mind, listless, apathetic, reticent; if he is growing
      fast; all these things would indicate <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>, and
      the proper use of it might save him from consumption, for many go into it in this way. If he
      has cough with expectoration, under <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>, it
      will be copious, purulent, offensive; under <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>,
      thick, heavy and of sweetish taste. All this condition of things may, when <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> is the remedy, find its cause in one or both of two
      things: Onanism or sexual excess, and too rapid growth. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric
      acid</font></i> has two very marked peculiarities in the urine, viz.,: very profuse and <i><font color="#0000ff">clear, watery</font></i>, or <i><font color="#0000ff">milky urine</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The first is found with general nervous depression, and if there is
      headache it is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium relieved</font></i> by the flow of
      urine. The other is from excess of phosphates in the urine, indicating nerve waste. We must
      distinguish between the profuse urine of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>, for the first is hysterical, the latter not at all
      so.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy, also one of our best remedies in typhoids, is found useful in
      cases of lower grade than in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> case. It
      comes nearer to <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis</font></i> than any other remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Its indications are given in "Hering's Guiding Symptoms" as well
      as anywhere. There is decomposition of fluids; the stools are involuntary while passing urine;
      stools dark, thin, or hæmorrhage of dark liquid blood. Mouth full of dark-bluish ulcers;
      unconscious. Moaning and <i><font color="#0000ff">sliding down in the bed</font></i> from
      excessive weakness; lower jaw fallen, <i><font color="#0000ff">tongue dry, leathery and
      shrunken to a third of its natural size</font></i>, and paralyzed; pulse weak and
      intermittent. It is hardly possible to draw a picture of a more desperate case of typhoid than
      this. It is not necessary to resort to quinine, brandy or any other fashionable so-called
      stimulants. Broth, milk or oatmeal gruel for nourishment, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Muriatic
      acid</font></i> will do all that can be done for the saying of the life of such a patient, and
      will do it quicker and with less liability to relapse than any other course of treatment. Of
      course the friends are anxious, even desperate, and a show of <i><font color="#0000ff">work</font></i>
      must be made. If much pressure is brought to bear in the way of suggestions or demands for
      counsel, all sorts of wonderful prescriptions that cured a great many cases like this, let <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>. be given every five minutes. It is a wonderfully <i><font color="#0000ff">quieting</font></i> medicine (to friends and meddlers) and should never be
      omitted. Send the most rampant howler off on horseback miles away, if you can, for something,
      no matter what. That is indispensable to the patient's recovery. The <i><font color="#0000ff">greatest
      danger</font></i> to the patient is, that the physician losing his presence of mind, will
      suffer himself to be led or driven away from the only true helpful course. This advice is
      given only to those who need it. Many a patient has died because his physician "lost his
      head" under this kind of pressure.</p>

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i> is another remedy of value in aphthous affections
      of the mouth. It is particularly efficacious in greatly debilitated subjects, and in children
      with marasmus with this kind of mouth. There is often present sour stomach (<i><font color="#0000ff">Iris versicol</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Robinia</font></i>,
      sour eructations and vomiting) with sour, vomiting, and <i><font color="#0000ff">the child
      smells sour all over despite the greatest care in regard to cleanliness</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Rheum, Hepar</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia</font></i>). One
      of the strongest characteristics, perhaps <i><font color="#0000ff">the</font></i> strongest,
      in weakened subjects in which this is the appropriate remedy, is a <i><font color="#0000ff">sense
      of internal trembling</font></i>. This is a subjective symptom, for, notwithstanding this
      positive sensation, to a degree that is very distressing, there is no visible trembling. This
      symptom is frequently found in old topers (see <i><font color="#0000ff">Ranunculus bulb</font></i>.),
      who are broken down or almost wrecked in health by strong drink. The symptom, however, is not
      confined to such subjects, but is often found in other cases when the debility is traceable to
      other causes; when markedly present from whatever cause. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric
      acid</font></i> should never be forgotten. We have already spoken of the value of this remedy
      in purpura hæmorrhagica. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus</font></i>, it has
      hæmorrhages from every outlet of the body (<i><font color="#0000ff">Acetic acid, Thlaspi</font></i>),
      and the blood also settles in <i><font color="#0000ff">ecchymosed spots under the skin</font></i>.
      This last symptom would indicate that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i> might
      be useful in black and blue spots in the skin, as the result of bruising, and practice
      corroborates it, and it follows well after <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum palustre</font></i> is also one of our best remedies for ecchymosis from
      bruises, "black eye," for instance; this is, of course, for bruises under the skin;
      While <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i> is just as efficacious for bruises of the
      periosteum. There is enough of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> element so that
      it may succeed in "flushes" of heat, after <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      has failed at the climacteric.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a comparatively new remedy, but has already, developed some
      valuable therapeutic powers. In the first place, it attacks the vital force, as is manifested
      by an excessive langour or persistent <b><font color="#ff0000">tired feeling</font></b> all
      over the body, which is generally accompanied with corresponding weakness of mind,
      indifference, and want of will power, and a desire to lie down. There is great heaviness of
      the legs, can hardly lift them from the ground, tired, aching feeling in the back with some
      burning (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc met</font></i>.)
      at times low down. Even the brain is fagged and the slightest exertion or mental effort brings
      on headache. This headache is oftenest found in students, overworked business men, and in
      persons depressed by grief or other emotions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It oftenest locates in occipito-cervical region (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nat.
      mur., Silicea</font></i>). &lt; especially by mental exertion. In short, this remedy presents
      a perfect picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">nervous prostration</font></i>. I found this
      remedy very useful in apparent failure of brain power in an old man who had always been strong
      up to within a year or so of the time he called on me. He complained of heaviness in the
      occiput and inability to exert the mind to talk or think, and general tired "played
      out" feeling. I feared brain softening but I gave him <i><font color="#0000ff">Picric
      acid</font></i> 6th trit. and it promptly <i><font color="#0000ff">cured</font></i> him. This
      remedy has strong points of resemblance to <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> in its effects upon the sexual organs
      especially of the male. There is strong sexual desire with terrible erections, which is
      followed by corresponding weakness or complete impotence. There seems to be no doubt that it
      is destined to become one of our most valuable remedies for brain, spinal, and general nervous
      prostration, especially if connected with or arising from sexual excesses. It may be studied
      along with <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium, Phosphoric acid, Phosphorus, Argentum nitricum,
      Sulphur, Alumina</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> and all those

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy affects, primarily, the whole nervous system. the most
      prominent symptom, as we are in the habit of recording the effects of remedies, is
      "complete relaxation and prostration of the whole muscular system, with almost or quite
      entire motor paralysis." This muscular prostration seems to come through inability of the
      nerves to convey impressions; thus we have the symptom "muscles will not obey the
      will." This condition comes on gradually, the first symptom being a feeling of lassitude
      or general fatigue. He wants to lie down he feels <i><font color="#0000ff">so weak</font></i>
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Picric acid</font></i>), and is inclined to drowsiness; the pulse
      becomes weak and slow, but is accelerated on the least motion. Then, if he attempts to walk,
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">legs tremble</font></i>, or the <i><font color="#0000ff">hands
      tremble</font></i> if he attempts to lift them, the <i><font color="#0000ff">tongue trembles</font></i>
      if he attempts to protrude it; all this from <i><font color="#0000ff">weakness</font></i>,
      both objective and subjective. If I were to put one adjective before this remedy to indicate
      its chief characteristic I would call it the <i><font color="#0000ff">trembling</font></i>
      remedy. Sometimes this trembling is so severe as to actually <i><font color="#0000ff">shake</font></i>
      the patient like a chill, but there is no chill, objective or subjective. This weakness may
      increase to the stage of complete paralysis, and such symptoms as these appear: The eyelids <i><font color="#0000ff">droop</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia, Caust</font></i>.) until
      they are completely closed. The fingers become unmanageable, so that he can no longer guide
      them over the keys of the piano in playing; he cannot guide his feet where he wants to in
      trying to walk, notwithstanding the sensorium remains clear, with perhaps the exception of a
      little drowsiness. He knows perfectly well what he wants to do, it cannot do it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Then again, there may be neuralgia in various parts, and the pains may be a
      dull aching all over (<i><font color="#0000ff">myalgia</font></i>), or they may be sudden and
      darting, so acute as to cause sudden starting. Or, again, it may cause spasms or convulsions;
      but with all these there is the characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">prostration</font></i>,
      for instance, in prosopalgia the eyelids droop from weakness. So we repeat <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium is pre-eminently a nerve remedy</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Having shown the central action of this great remedy as it manifests itself
      upon the nervous system, we will proceed to notice some of its local uses which will always be
      more or less associated with such action. Upon the mind it shows its depressing power, and is
      portrayed in such symptoms as these: <i><font color="#0000ff">The Gelsemium subject is torpid,
      sleepy and dreads movement. The mental faculties are dull, cannot think clearly or fix his
      attention</font></i>: "desires to be quiet; does not wish to speak or have any one near
      her for company, even if the person be silent." This condition of mind is in perfect
      accordance with the general nervous prostration already described. This condition of mind
      sometimes is temporarily suspended to give place to an alternate condition of excitement. But
      this is not the leading, characteristic, and legitimate effect of the drug, but is only the
      reaction; like a state of sleeplessness is to the characteristic sleepiness or stupor of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>. I consider the large doses of either remedy used by some to
      quiet excited conditions, or to control spasms or convulsions by their toxic, depressing, or
      paralyzing action on the muscular system, antipathyc and in no way truly curative.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is an excessively sensitive condition of the nerves that is very
      peculiar, and that this remedy controls markedly, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">susceptibility
      to mental disturbance, such as sudden excitement or emotion, bad news or fright, the
      anticipation of an unusual ordeal</font></i>. One of the effects following these things is a
      diarrhœa. Many people are thus affected. <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> not
      only cures the diarrhœa for the time being, but often cures the whole abnormal condition. I
      have never known the remedy to do much good in these conditions below the 30th potency, but
      often in the potencies much above that.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As would be naturally supposed from its general action upon the nervous
      system, this remedy exerts a decided influence upon the sensorium and brain. <i><font color="#0000ff">Dizziness, with blurred vision, pupils dilated, double sight and sense of
      intoxication, show this influence</font></i>. One very characteristic symptom appears here
      which is found under only one other remedy with any prominence, viz., "<i><font color="#0000ff">child starts and grasps the nurse and screams, as if afraid of falling</font></i>."
      If there is any difference between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i>, it is
      that in <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i> the child manifests this fear only when it
      is being laid down in the cradle, or from <i><font color="#0000ff">downward motion</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="justify">The most characteristic headache of <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>
      is a dull, tired headache at the <i><font color="#0000ff">base of the brain</font></i>. The
      patient wants to lie with head raised upon a high pillow, and lie perfectly still. It is
      aggravated by mental labor, smoking tobacco, lying with the head low, and in the heat of the
      sun. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine, Lachesis, Lyssin, Natrum carb</font></i>.). It is
      temporarily ameliorated by pressure and stimulants. Such headaches often follow a debauch.
      Sometimes we have a headache from passive congestion; then the pain begins in the occiput and
      spreads all over the head. The aggravations are about the same as in the other variety, or
      nervous headache. One notable characteristic is that sometimes the headache is <i><font color="#0000ff">relieved by a profuse flow of urine</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lac
      defloratum</font></i> has a profuse flow of urine <i><font color="#0000ff">during</font></i>
      sick headache to which it is adapted, but the pain is not so markedly relieved by the flow). <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> has also a sick headache that is preceded by <i><font color="#0000ff">blindness</font></i>. As the head begins to ache the blindness disappears. The
      sick headache of this remedy is not accompanied with much nausea and vomiting, as is that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sanguinaria, Iris versicolor</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lac
      defloratum</font></i>, but is accompanied by the characteristic weakness and trembling
      belonging to this remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> is one of the
      so-called fever remedies. It is useful in the remittent fever of children. The fever is never
      of that active or violent form calling for <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>, but of a milder form. The child lies drowsy, does not
      want to move, or, if it does, cannot move much on account of the weakness. One author says
      that <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> stands midway between <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum viride</font></i>. I
      should rather place it between <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>,
      there is prostration, but the typhoid tongue and other symptoms are not so strong. There may
      be dark red face with both and a sort of besotted expression; but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> the sensorium comes more fully under the influence of the
      drug, so that the patient will fall asleep even when trying to answer questions. Then the
      offensive sweat, stool and urine of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> are not found
      under <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>,
      there is congestion to the brain and dilated pupils, but it is not so intense, accompanied by
      active or violent delirium as with <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna. Gelsemium</font></i>
      is not a very great intermittent fever remedy; but is one of the best for <i><font color="#0000ff">nervous chill</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> chills
      run up and down the back in wave-like succession from sacrum to occiput; chill begins between
      scapulæ, <i><font color="#0000ff">Capsic., Sepia</font></i>; chill begins in lumbar region, <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupat. purp</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nat. m</font></i>.; chill
      begins in dorsal region, <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupat. perf., Lach</font></i>.); when there
      is great shaking and chattering of the teeth, with no objective, or even sense of coldness. <i><font color="#0000ff">Patient wants to be held because he shakes so</font></i>." This kind of
      chill is frequently found in hysterical, and heart diseases (organic). The pulse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> is <i><font color="#0000ff">slow</font></i> when quiet,
      but greatly accelerated on motion. For the weak, slow pulse of old age there is no remedy
      oftener useful. For the nervous prostration already described, just preceding typhoid, there
      is nothing like <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>. I have aborted many cases of
      typhoid fever with this remedy -at least I think so.</p>
