      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia tinctoria</font></i> will quite naturally come in here, as it is
      often indicated after the <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> stage is over in
      fevers. Typhoid fever can be aborted under proper homœopathic treatment, no matter what the
      old school says to the contrary. I have had but one case of typhoid fever run its full course
      in seven years, and that was a case of a young lady whose mother tried to treat her, until the
      disease was fully established. The symptoms indicating <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>
      are, in the first stage, great nervousness, chilliness, aching pains all over, but especially
      in head, back and limbs, and a sensation of <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness all over</font></i>;
      feels as if bruised. Then the patient grows weak, prostrated, drowsy, becomes confused, the
      face and eyes suffused so as to give it a "besotted appearance"; the sensorium is so
      blunted that the patient falls asleep even before he can answer a question, or while he is in
      the middle of an answer. Then the tongue becomes streaked down the middle, at first white,
      even becomes brown in a well-defined streak down the middle, and as he comes more fully under
      the typhoid influence he mutters and reaches about the bed, tossing to and fro, and if he says
      anything he says he feels "<i><font color="#0000ff">scattered around the bed and is
      trying to get the pieces together</font></i>." Now the bowels begin to rumble, especially
      in the ilio-cæcal region, which is also sensitive to touch; later still the bowels begin to
      discharge, and all the discharges (stool, urine and sweat) are extremely offensive. This is a
      true picture of a <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> typhoid, and I have aborted in
      the first stage many cases and even checked their progress (in other cases) and cured them
      when they had been running eight to twelve days. I have used both the low and high
      preparations with equal success, but now use the 30th potency.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">FERRUM PHOSPHORICUM.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This one of Schuessler's tissue remedies has proven a valuable remedy in
      some inflammatory diseases. In keeping with its element of <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i>,
      it presents the <i><font color="#0000ff">local congestion tendencies</font></i> of that
      remedy; and in its <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> element its affinity for the
      lungs and stomach; and in its combination proves a great <i><font color="#0000ff">hæmorrhage
      remedy</font></i>. The hæmorrhages are of bright blood, and may come from any outlet of the
      body. Further proving and clinical use will enable us to use it more scientifically then we
      now do. So far as I have observed, it is not adapted to the full-blooded, sanguine, arterial
      subjects, with an overplus of red blood that <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      cures, but rather to pale, anæmic subjects, who with all their weaknesses are nevertheless
      subject to sudden and violent local congestions and inflammations, like pneumonia, or sudden
      congestions to head, bowels, or any other part, or to inflammatory affections of a rheumatic
      character. It is only useful in the first stage of such attacks, before the stage of exudation
      appears. It has been found useful also in the above-described weakened or anæmic subjects who
      have <i><font color="#0000ff">sour eructations</font></i> occurring in stomach troubles,
      usually termed dyspeptic. In dysentery, in the first stage with a good deal of blood in the
      discharges, it is very valuable, and often cures in a very short time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, it is often efficacious in the night sweats of the weak and anæmic.
      I am sorry not to be able to give characteristic indications for the use of this remedy, but I
      am fully persuaded that is a very valuable one and ought to receive a thoroughly Hahnemannian
      proving.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum viride</font></i> is another remedy which at one time had a great
      reputation in the first or congestive stage of inflammatory diseases, and especially in those
      organs coming under the control of the pneumogastric nerve, viz., pharynx, œsophagus, stomach
      and heart. For a time the journals fairly bristled with reported cures of pneumonia, and its
      curative power was attributed to the influence of the remedy to control the action of heart
      and pulse. It was claimed that if we could control the quickened circulation so as to decrease
      the amount of blood forced into the congested lung, that you thereby gave the lung a chance to
      free itself of the existing engorgement.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It looked plausible, and certainly in many cases remarkable cures were
      effected, and that in a short time. I was a young physician and thought I had found a prize in
      this remedy. But one day I left a patient, relieved by this remedy of an acute and violent
      attack of pneumonia, to go to a town five miles distant, and when I returned found my patient
      dead. Then I watched others treated with this remedy, and found every little while a patient
      with pneumonia dropping out <i><font color="#0000ff">suddenly</font></i> when they were
      reported better.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now we don't hear so much of <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum vir</font></i>.
      as the greatest remedy for the first stage of this disease. What was the matter? 1st. It was
      (like other fads) used too indiscriminately. 2d. It is not desirable (it is wrong) to control
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">depress the pulse</font></i>, regardless of all the other
      conditions. 3d. The patients, who had weak hearts, were killed by this powerful heart
      depressant. A quickened circulation is salutary, in all inflammatory diseases, and is evidence
      that the <i><font color="#0000ff">Natural power</font></i> to resist disease is there, and at
      work. The pulse will come to its normality when the cause of its disturbance is removed and
      never should be forced to do so until then. Here is a common fault of the old school
      notwithstanding their cry of "<i><font color="#0000ff">Tolle causam</font></i>." So
      I find fault with Guernsey's keynote, "Great activity of the arterial system; very quick
      pulse." Next to <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis, Veratrum viride</font></i> slows the
      pulse, as is abundantly shown in the provings. If quick pulse is ever a result of this remedy,
      it is a secondary or reactionary effect, like the sleeplessness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
      or constipation of cathartics. So it seems to me that as an antiphlogistic (forgive me) it
      must go into the shade with the once vaunted <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Then what is <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum viride</font></i> good for?
      Well, I do not think that its sphere is yet fully defined, or can be without further provings
      and verification. The provings are already carried far enough to show that it must be a very
      powerful and useful remedy. That it inflames the œsophagus or stomach is well known, as is
      the fact that it congests the brain and lungs, but what are the characteristic symptoms that
      will enable us to prescribe this remedy in preference to the other remedies that do the same
      thing is not so well known. One peculiar symptom I believe to be characteristic, and which I
      have verified in a very severe case of erysipelas, which was accompanied by great delirium, is
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">a narrow, well-defined red streak right through the middle of
      the tongue</font></i>." Again I believe <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum viride</font></i>
      to be one of our best remedies for spasms, twitchings and convulsions, but do not know of any
      very reliable symptoms guiding us to its selection in the individual case. I once cured a man
      of a very severe and persistent attack of vomiting, which was aggravated on rising, with this
      remedy. He had suffered from several similar attacks before, but never any after this one, now
      several years ago.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is a remedy that <b><font color="#ff0000">has</font></b> a
      characteristic "<i><font color="#0000ff">Cold sweat on the forehead</font></i>". It
      makes no difference whether it is cholera, cholera infantum, pneumonia, asthma, typhoid fever
      or constipation; if this symptom is prominently present, and the patient is in anything like a
      faint, collapse, or greatly prostrated condition, <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album</font></i>
      is the first remedy to think of. It is one of Hahnemann's trio of remedies for Asiatic
      cholera, <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum
      metallicum</font></i> being the other two; and today his indications for its use stand as true
      as when he first gave them to the profession. It abides the test because it is founded upon a
      natural law of cure, which is the same "yesterday, today, and forever."</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum, alb</font></i>. has some very strong mind symptoms. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Mania with desire to cut and tear things especially clothes, with lewdness and
      lascivious talk, religious or amorous</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here the choice will sometimes have to be made between this remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>. They are both very loquacious, and both strongly
      religious. Also both at times very violent; but the face of <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>
      is generally very red and bloated, while that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i>
      is likely to be pale, sunken or hippocratic; again, there is greater general weakness with <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i>. Sometimes the violent form of mania alternates with a
      "disposition to silence," but if irritated gets mad, scolds, calls names and talks
      of the faults of others. These forms of mania are often consequent upon suppressed menses or
      the puerperal state. They may be acute or become chronic. In either case we may find the cure
      in <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If we were to describe in <i><font color="#0000ff">one word</font></i> the
      general condition, as near as possible, for which this remedy was best, it would be <b><font color="#ff0000">collapse</font></b>. Let me quote: "Rapid sinking of forces; complete
      prostration; cold sweat and cold breath." "Skill blue, purple, cold, wrinkled,
      remaining in folds when pinched". "Face hippocratic; nose pointed." "Whole
      body icy cold." "Cold skin, face cold, back cold." "Hands icy cold."
      "Feet and legs icy cold." (Icy coldness of surface, covered with cold sweat, <i><font color="#0000ff">Tabacum</font></i>.) "Cramps in calves." All these are verified
      symptoms, and show to what an extreme degree of collapse a case may come and yet be cured.
      This condition may be found in rapidly progressing, acute cases like cholera, or it may be
      found in suppressed exanthemata; or, again, in the course of bronchitis, pneumonia, typhoid or
      intermittent fever. No matter where found, or in connection with whatever disease, if this
      collapse is present, and especially if the grand keynote, "<i><font color="#0000ff">cold
      sweat on face and forehead</font></i>," is present, we may give this remedy with full
      confidence that it will do all that <i><font color="#0000ff">can be</font></i> done and much
      more than the old school system of stimulation with alcoholics. In choleraic diseases <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> comes nearest to <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i>,
      but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i> the stools are profuse and like
      rice-water, while they are scanty or entirely absent with <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i>.
      The pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i> are very severe sometimes, driving
      the patient to delirium. It is said to be a good remedy for rheumatism, which is worse in wet
      weather and which drives the patient out of bed (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum met</font></i>.).
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i> is a remedy of wide range, because it covers a
      condition which may be found in so many different diseases.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another remedy of not very wide range, so far as we have any clinical

      <p align="JUSTIFY">We know of its use in the advanced stage of serious brain troubles, such as
      meningitis or any trouble of the brain where is threatened effusion, or effusion already

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Helleborus niger</font></i> can often cure such cases, as I have often
      observed, not only in my own practice, but in that of others. I have sometimes observed that
      the first sign of improvement in such cases was a decided increase in the urine, and following
      it a general subsidence of all the other bad symptoms. I have used it with most prompt and
      satisfactory results in the 1000th (B. &amp; T.) and 33m. (Fincke's) potencies.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The grand central characteristic symptom is expressed in one word -<b><font color="#ff0000">spasms</font></b>. If in brain affections, congestions, meningitis or apoplexy
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i> is to do any good, spasm will be present in some
      degree, at least, from a simple twitching of the fingers and toes to general convulsions. If
      in cardialgia, there is violent <i><font color="#0000ff">spasmodic</font></i> griping and
      pressure, followed by vomiting. In cholera, cholera morbus, or cholera infantum the cramping
      pains are sometimes <i><font color="#0000ff">terrible</font></i>. Dunham said: "In <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> collapse is most prominent; in <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum
      album</font></i>, the evacuation and vomiting; in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i>,
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">cramps</font></i>." In whooping cough "<i><font color="#0000ff">children get stiff, breathing ceases, spasmodic twitchings; after a while
      consciousness returns</font></i>, they vomit and recover but slowly;" or the child coughs
      itself into a complete "cataleptic spasm with each paroxysm of cough." In all kinds
      of repercussed exanthematic spasms, <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i> is the first
      remedy to be thought of (see comparison with <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These spasms may also be found in dysmenorrhœa, in child bed, or in after
      pains. Then, aside from any and all kinds of local affections, <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i>
      may be found indicated in epilepsia, chorea, and other purely nervous spasmodic affections of
      a general nature. There is one thing peculiar in the spasms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i>
      that I have often observed, and it is a strong indication for the remedy, viz.: The spasm
      begins by twitching in the <i><font color="#0000ff">fingers and toes</font></i>, and,
      spreading from there, becomes general.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another symptom which Farrington thought very valuable, viz.:
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">Mental and bodily exhaustion</font></i> from overexertion of
      mind, or loss of sleep." This is similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>
      and. <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>. The other symptoms must decide between
      them. I have always used the metal instead of the acetate, because I used the potencies, and
      it acted promptly.</p>

      <b><font color="#ff0000">violent</font></b> convulsions. With this remedy the patient is

      the <i><font color="#0000ff">bending</font></i> of the head, neck and spine backwards,
      opisthotonos. It is on this account that it was tried for cerebro-spinal meningitis. Dr.
      Baker, of Moravia, N. Y., cured, during an epidemic of this terrible disease, sixty cases of
      all degrees of malignancy without the loss of a single case. This is a wonderful record, and

      good remedy for the effects of concussion of the brain or spine, if spasms are in the train of
      chronic effects therefrom and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> does not relieve. In
      the affections for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Cicuta</font></i> is useful the actions of

      had a case of eczema capitis in a young woman -it was of long standing- which covered the
      whole scalp, solid, like a cap. I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Cicuta</font></i> 200th
      and cured her completely in a very short time. She had used many local applications without
      benefit.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a very unique remedy, proven by Hahnemann and classed among the
      anti-psorics. Its exact chemical composition is not known but it is supposed to be a kind of
      potash preparation.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has quite a long list of peculiar symptoms, which are, nevertheless,
      very reliable. In the first place it has <i><font color="#0000ff">great weakness</font></i>,
      such as characterizes the potash salts generally. It is with <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">faint-like weakness, or sinking of strength, with trembling</font></i>."
      In this it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>, and it has another
      symptom, in connection with its general weakness which resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>,
      viz.: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Drooping of the lids</font></i>." <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia, Causticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>
      is the trio having this peculiar symptom in a very marked degree. Now, the weakness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> progresses until we have "<i><font color="#0000ff">gradually
      appearing paralysis</font></i>," indeed, <i><font color="#0000ff">paralysis</font></i> is
      common with <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> and attacks in a general way the
      right side (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis the left</font></i>), but it also has local
      paralysis; as, for instance, of the <i><font color="#0000ff">vocal organs, muscles of
      deglutition, of tongue, eyelids, face, bladder</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">extremities</font></i>.
      On the other hand, it has all grades of nervous twitchings, chorea, convulsions and epileptic
      attacks, even progressive locomotor ataxia. I can only name these diseases here, but will
      notice further on the symptoms and conditions which appear in connection with them.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Neuralgic affections are also common with this remedy and are generally of
      an obstinate character. <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> has helped me out in
      such cases when other seemingly indicated remedies failed. One of our oldest and most eminent
      writers on Materia Medica, Charles J. Hempel, sneered at the multiplicity of symptoms of this
      remedy, as found in the "<i><font color="#0000ff">Chronic Diseases</font></i>," but
      the clinical test has proven it to be a remedy of great use and wide range. On the mind it
      exerts a very depressing influence in keeping with its general action on the nervous system. <i><font color="#0000ff">Melancholy mood; sadness</font></i>, hopelessness; is apt to look on the dark
      side of everything. This melancholy may come from care, grief or sorrow. It often comes from
      long lasting brief or sorrow, and should be remembered here alongside <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia,
      Natrum muriaticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is the preponderant mood of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>,
      but it may alternate with an anxious, irritable or hysterical mood. We have already spoken of
      the paralysis of the eyelids. The vision is often affected; there is an appearance of gauze
      before the eyes, or as if a fog or cloud were there. This is often the case in incipient
      cataract, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> often remedies it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the ears there is roaring, tinkling, humming and all sorts of noises.
      It is one of our best remedies in deafness with these noises. Reverberation of sounds,
      especially the patient's own voice, finds here a remedy. Then the ears (external) burn and are
      very red. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> also has this symptom very prominently:
      and right here we may say that there are many resemblances between these two remedies, and
      they follow each other well, especially in chronic diseases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the face we have four prominent peculiar symptoms:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st. Yellowness of the face; sickly yellow (not jaundice).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2d. Paralysis of a rheumatic or psoric origin.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">3d. Prosopalgia of the same origin.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">4th. Stiffness of the jaws; could not open the mouth.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This latter symptom also seems to be rheumatic and is in keeping with the
      arthritis deformans, of which we will say more further on.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the tongue we have: 1st. Paralisis; or indistinct speech without
      complete paralysis (<i><font color="#0000ff">Gels</font></i>.). 2d. Tongue coated white on the
      sides, red in the middle, but not so sharply defined as in <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum
      viride</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The throat comes strongly under the influence of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Burning pain in throat, not &lt; by swallowing; pain is in both sides
      or seems to arise from chest."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Rawness and tickling in throat with dry cough and some expectoration
      after long coughing."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This again in similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, which
      has burning in throat, more on right side. I have found that if <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      did not relieve, <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> given after it, often would.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Intestinal Canal. </font></i>-Sensation of lime being burned in the
      stomach, with rising of air. Guernsey praised this symptom and considered it reliable. I have
      not verified if <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> is one of our best remedies in
      anal troubles, and has very peculiar symptoms. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Constipation,
      frequent but unsuccessful desire to stool</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nux</font></i>.)
      "Frequent ineffectual desire to stool, with much pain and straining, <i><font color="#0000ff">with redness of face</font></i>." "The stool passes better when
      standing. Hæmorrhoids impeding stool, swollen; itching: smarting; rawness; moist; stinging;
      burning; <i><font color="#0000ff">raw and sore</font></i>, aggravated when <b><font color="#ff0000">walking</font></b>, when thinking of them, from preaching or straining the
      voice." All these symptoms have been verified over and over again. There are other
      symptoms also in this region that are very valuable, but we are not writing a complete Materia
      Medica and will only say in addition that in all anal troubles we should let <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> rank among the first in our mind when we are hunting for
      the simillimum. We do not know in what part the peculiar and characteristic symptom which
      leads to the simillimum will appear, but must be on the alert to recognize it promptly.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> also has very marked action upon the urinary organs,
      as is shown by the following symptoms: "Itching of the orifice of the urethra."
      "Constant ineffectual desire to urinate, frequent evacuations of only a few drops, with
      spasms in the rectum and constipation."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>, and I once cured a chronic case of cystitis in a married
      woman, which had baffled the best efforts of several old school physicians, eminent for their
      skill for years. There was another symptom in the case that was prominent, and that was a
      sensation of <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">rawness</font></i>.
      More will be said, when we come to write on <i><font color="#0000ff">sensations,</font></i> of
      this last symptom. Again, "retention of urine, with frequent and urgent desire,
      occasionally a few drops dribble away."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Involuntary passage of urine when <i><font color="#0000ff">coughing</font></i>,
      sneezing, <i><font color="#0000ff">blowing the nose</font></i>; at nigh <i><font color="#0000ff">when asleep</font></i>; when walking." "He urinates so easily that
      he is not sensible of the stream, and scarcely believes in the dark that he is urinating at
      all, until he makes sure by sense of touch." I do not know of any remedy in which this
      weakness of the neck of the bladder is more prominent. <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      also affects the urine itself "The urine is loaded with lithic acid and lithates
      (Hughes), there are thick deposits or sediments of various colors from dark to light"
      These are a few of the leading urinary symptoms and show its importance here.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Respiratory Organs</font></i>. -Hoarseness worse in the morning, with
      rawness and sudden loss of voice. Laryngeal muscles refuse to act; cannot speak a loud word.
      Chronic hoarseness remaining after acute laryngitis. Hoarseness with deep bass voice (like <i><font color="#0000ff">Drosera</font></i>). These are all very reliable symptoms, and no remedy
      removes them oftener than <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>. All this loss of
      voice may come from paresis of the vocal chords, or from catarrhal causes. Then following down
      the respiratory tract, we have great <i><font color="#0000ff">rawness</font></i> and
      irritation of the trachea, cough dry, hollow; with sore or <i><font color="#0000ff">raw</font></i>
      sensation in a streak down along the trachea. <i><font color="#0000ff">Cough with pain in hip
      and involuntary urination</font></i>. Cough with sensation as if she could not cough deep
      enough to start the mucus. Coughs worse on expiration (<i><font color="#0000ff">Acon</font></i>.)
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Cough relieved by a swallow of cold water</font></i>. Cough with
      inability to raise the mucus, it must be swallowed; but the most characteristic symptom all
      through the cough and chest symptoms is the sensation of <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness and
      rawness</font></i> accompanying them. Some will express this as a sensation of <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>, if so we must remember <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i>. In influenza or what is now called <i><font color="#0000ff">La Grippe</font></i> it disputes for first place with <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium
      perf</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicod</font></i>. All three have a tired,
      sore, bruised sensation all over the body, and all have soreness in the chest when coughing,
      but if involuntary micturition is present <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> wins.
      No homœopath can afford to be without an understanding of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      upon the respiratory organs.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now upon the back and extremities we have -stiffness and pain in neck and
      throat, muscles feel as if bound, could scarce move the head. Painful stiffness of the back
      and sacrum, especially on rising from a chair. Paralysis of either or both lower and upper
      extremities. Dull drawing pain in hands and arms. Drawing and tearing in thighs and legs,
      knees and feet, worse in open air and better in bed. Weakness and trembling of the limbs.
      Rheumatic and arthritic inflammations with contractions of the flexors and stiffness of the
      joints. All these, and many more symptoms, show what a useful remedy this must be in its
      general action on the back and extremities, but right here I wish to say that if I were to
      select the three remedies to the exclusion of all others for the treatment of chronic
      rheumatism and paralysis <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum, Rhus tox</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> would be the three. These three remedies studied in their
      correspondence and relation to each other will more than repay the careful student, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> holds well its own in the comparison. You will remember
      that I have before alluded to the resemblances of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, and may continue to do so further on. I wish
      here, although constitutionally opposed to making too much of complementaries and
      incompatibles (so-called), to state that there are no two remedies that are oftener indicated
      after each other, and work as well when so indicated, than these two. If Hahnemann had never
      given to the homœopathic school any remedy but <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>,
      the world would still be to him under lasting obligations.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Sensations. -Tearing pains</font></i> are, characteristic of this remedy.
      They are often paroxysmal. This is often found in neuralgia of the face. Then again I wish to
      call particular attention to the sensation of <b><font color="#ff0000">soreness</font></b> or <b><font color="#ff0000">rawness</font></b>. This is found in scalp, throat, larynx and trachea, chest,
      rectum, anus, urethra and eruptions. We observe that the sensation of soreness is not like
      that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, which is a soreness as if bruised and
      mostly muscular, nor of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i>, which is an
      aching soreness as if sprained and oftenest found in the tendons and sheaths of muscles, or
      areolar tissues; but it is a soreness mostly, if not altogether, of mucous surfaces as if the
      parts were <i><font color="#0000ff">raw</font></i>. This is important and a very reliable
      sensation. Then again we have in <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum much burning</font></i>.
      These burnings are found almost everywhere, and in this we again see its resemblance to <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. Now let it be remembered that the burnings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> are associated with <i><font color="#0000ff">itching</font></i>,
      those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis mellifica</font></i> with stinging, and those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> with soreness. So we must always learn to differentiate,
      because it is only by so doing that we can select the one remedy out of a class, and sometimes
      a large class, having the same or similar symptoms. The <i><font color="#0000ff">drawing pains</font></i>
      that in many cases result in forcing out of shape the extremities so as to cause that terrible
      affliction known as <i><font color="#0000ff">arthritis deformans</font></i> are found as
      prominently under <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> as under any other remedy, and
      it is one of the most useful agents for the relief or cure.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="justify"><i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> is classed among Hahnemann's anti-psorics. It is
      certainly one of the prominent remedies for affections arising from the suppression of itch or
      chronic skin troubles, like eczema. I was once called, in consultation, to a case of
      prosopalgia which had for a long time baffled the skill of a very good homœopathic
      practitioner. Not being able to relieve the case, he had become demoralized, and as the pain
      and suffering were very great he had resorted to anodynes, but with the usual result of making
      the patient worse, after the anodynes had worn out, than she was before. On looking over the
      case carefully, I found in addition to the emaciated and greatly debilitated condition of the
      patient, after so long suffering, that the pains came in paroxysms, that they were of a
      drawing nature, and that she had suffered from eczema for years, at different times, before
      this pain appeared. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> had been given, but without
      relief. So I advised <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>. It was given, in the
      200th, and a rapid and a permanent cure was the result. Whether <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      could be called an anti-sycotic as well as anti-psoric, or not, I do not know. Certain it is
      that it is one of our most successful remedies for warts. It stands next to <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>, if not equal. It is also foremost in old sores originating
      in burns. I have given more space to <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> than I
      otherwise would, for the reason that I am sure that this great remedy is not generally
      appreciated. I know of no remedy more positive and satisfactory in its action when indicated.
