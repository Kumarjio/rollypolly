      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy standing half-way between those two great anti-psorics, <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea carb</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, has
      some very strong characteristics which guide to its use in a variety of ailments. Its
      strongest characteristic is its <b><font color="#ff0000">hypersensitiveness</font></b> to <i><font color="#0000ff">touch, pain</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">cold air</font></i>. The
      patient is so sensitive to pain that she faints away, even when it is slight. If there are
      inflammation or swelling in any locality, or even eruptions on the skin, they are so sensitive
      that she <i><font color="#0000ff">cannot bear to have them touched</font></i>, or even to have
      the cold air to blow upon them. This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">China off</font></i>.,
      only that while the latter is sensitive to the lightest touch it <i><font color="#0000ff">can</font></i>
      bear hard pressure. (Remedies especially &lt; in cold air are <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum
      alb., Calcarea ost., Hepar sul., Nux vomica, Psorinum, Silicea, Tuberculinum</font></i>.).
      This supersensitiveness to pain runs all through the drug. It is mental as well as physical,
      for the slightest cause irritates with hasty speech and vehemence. Next to this is the power
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulph</font></i>. over the suppurative stage of local
      inflammations. It comes in only when pus is about to form, or is already formed. If given very
      high in the first case (that is before pus is formed), and not repeated too soon or often, we
      may prevent suppuration and check the whole inflammatory process. But if pus is already
      formed, it will hasten the pointing and discharge and help along the healing of the ulcer
      afterwards. I am not at all sure, as is generally taught, that it is necessary to give it low
      to hasten suppuration. The most rapid pointing, opening, and perfect healing I ever saw was in
      the case of a large glandular swelling on the neck of a child, under the action of the c. m.
      potency. <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i> has a general tendency to suppuration, for
      even the eruptions on the skin are liable to form matter, and slight injuries suppurate. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites, Mercurius, Petroleum</font></i>.) This remedy is very valuable in
      diseases of the respiratory organs. I have found it very useful in cases of chronic catarrh,
      when the nose stopped up every time the patient went out into the cold air. He says it seems
      as if I get a new cold every time I get a breath of fresh air (<i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i>).
      It is relieved in a warm room. In croup it has been, ever since Bœnninghausen prescribed his
      celebrated five powders, one of our standard remedies. We do not use the five powders as
      Bœnninghausen did in a certain order, but only use them according to indications. <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i> croup is accompanied with rather loose cough, with wheezing
      and rattling. Cough as if mucus would come up, but it does not. It is seldom indicated at
      first; but oftener comes in after <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i>. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> it seems
      most effectual in those cases brought on by exposure to dry cold air; but the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite croup comes on in the evening after first sleep</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar in the early morning hours</font></i>. This tendency to croupy
      exudations on mucous membranes seems characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i>
      and is not confined to the respiratory organs. Kafka uses it on the ground of its ability to
      control such conditions in post scarlatinal dropsy, to prevent or cure, and claims great
      success for it. I believe it to be one of the best prophylactics in such cases, for the reason
      that during and after the desquamative stage the skin is unusually susceptible to the effects
      of chill in cold air, and this is in accordance with the <i><font color="#0000ff">leading</font></i>
      characteristic of this remedy. It <i><font color="#0000ff">fortifies</font></i> the patient
      against such atmospheric influence.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In croup, as in other affections of <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i>,
      the cough, difficult breathing and all other symptoms are aggravated by the least of breath
      cold air, which the little patient must be carefully guarded against. Traveling downward the
      larynx is attacked, then the bronchia, and even the lungs, and the formation of croupy
      exudates will take place if not checked by the remedy. The breathing in all these cases
      becomes rattling, anxious, wheezing, even to threatened suffocation, so that the patient seems
      asthmatic. In. these cases it is often able to relieve, especially if this condition follows a
      hard cold and the acute inflammatory symptoms have been controlled by <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      or some other indicated remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In chronic asthma, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i> often
      resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulphuricum</font></i>, but there is this diagnostic
      difference, which is very valuable. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i> asthma is
      worse in <i><font color="#0000ff">dry cold</font></i> air and better in damp, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulph</font></i>. is exactly the opposite, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i>. There is no other remedy that I know that has the
      amelioration so strongly in damp weather as <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphur</font></i>.
      One characteristic must not be forgotten, viz.: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Coughs when any
      part of the body becomes uncovered</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>.). This is found in croup, laryngitis,
      bronchitis and consumption, and not only is the <i><font color="#0000ff">cough</font></i>
      worse, but the whole case is aggravated. Then, again, it must be remembered that this is one
      of our strongest anti-psorics, and for that reason should be thought of for all respiratory
      ailments for which it has such a strong affinity, especially when such ailments have followed
      a suppressed or retrocedent eruption on the skin.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In accordance with its great power over all suppurative processes, it
      should come to mind in abscess of the lungs, of course in all cases when indicated by the
      symptoms <i><font color="#0000ff">in toto</font></i>. Upon the throat we have 1st,
      "sticking in the throat, as from a splinter, on swallowing, extending to the ear, also on
      yawning." "Sensation as if a fish bone or splinter were sticking in the throat"
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum, Dolichos</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric
      acid</font></i>), but probably the condition where <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i>
      is oftenest of use in throat trouble is in that distressing complaint, <i><font color="#0000ff">quinsy</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here, as in croup, it is not generally indicated in the beginning. Having
      had much success and experience in this disease, I may here give the results of the
      application of several remedies and their indications:</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>. -High fever, great swelling, and redness, headache,
      throbbing carotids.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius vivus</font></i>. -Either side, fœtid breath, flabby, moist,
      indented tongue, and sweat without relief.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius proto-iodatus</font></i>. -same symptoms, but begins on right
      side, and tongue thickly coated <i><font color="#0000ff">yellow</font></i> at the base.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>. -Left side extending to right, great sensitiveness to
      touch, and aggravation after sleep.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>. -Begins right side, extends to left, with tongue
      swollen and inclined to protrude from the mouth, and stuffing up of nose.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lac caninum</font></i>. -Alternates sides, one day worse on one, and the
      next on the other.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulph</font></i>. -When notwithstanding all other remedies the case
      seems bound to suppurate and there is much <i><font color="#0000ff">throbbing</font></i> pain.
      Now with each of these remedies I have aborted many cases in old quinsy subjects, who never
      expected to, and were told by old school physicians that they never could, get well, without
      suppuration, and in the end have cured them of all tendency thereto. I will add here that <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphur</font></i>, is also a good remedy in chronic hypertrophy of
      tonsils, with hardness of hearing. In these cases which are generally very intractable, <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta carbonica, Lycopodium, Plumbum</font></i>, and others are also to be
      consulted according to indications.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Upon the alimentary canal <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i> has a
      decided influence. We have already noticed its action upon the throat. The stomach is inclined
      to be out of order, and there is a "<i><font color="#0000ff">longing for acid things</font></i>."
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum alb</font></i>.) This is often the case in chronic
      dyspepsia and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i> helps. This condition of the stomach
      is sometimes found in marasmus of children. It is often accompanied by diarrhœa, and a very
      important feature is that the diarrhea is <i><font color="#0000ff">sour</font></i>; indeed <i><font color="#0000ff">the whole child seems to smell sour</font></i> no matter how much it is
      bathed. The sour stool is also very prominently under <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia
      carbonica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea carbonica</font></i>. Then there is
      another condition of the bowels, namely, a kind of <i><font color="#0000ff">atony</font></i>.
      The stools are passed with great difficulty, even though they are soft and clay-like, as they
      sometimes are under this remedy. This state of atony is also found in the bladder.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Micturition impeded, he is obliged to wait awhile before the urine
      passes, and then it flows slowly for many days." "He is never able to finish
      urinating; it seems as if some urine always remains behind in the bladder."
      "Weakness of the bladder, the urine drops vertically down and he is obliged to wait
      awhile before any passes." This inability to expel makes one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>. Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulph.</font></i> is
      a great "<i><font color="#0000ff">sweat</font></i>" remedy, either partial or
      general. It may, for instance, come in after <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> in
      rheumatism, in which the patient "<i><font color="#0000ff">sweats day and night without
      relief</font></i>," and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> does not help. So,
      too, with quinsy, and in large boils and swellings; and by the way <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar
      sulph</font></i>. is one of our best remedies after <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>
      either in homœopathic practice, or as an antidote to old school poisoning so also is it the
      leading antidote to Iodide of Potassa poisoning from the same source. We could not well do
      without this valuable remedy.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">CALCAREA SULPHURICA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One of Schuessler's so-called tissue remedies, not well understood as yet,
      but acting much along the line of <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphur</font></i>, so far as
      we do know. I once had a case in which there was great pain in the region of the kidneys for a
      day and night. Then there was a great discharge of pus in the urine, which continued several
      days and weakened the patient very fast. A Chicago specialist had examined the urine a short
      time before, and had pronounced the case <i><font color="#0000ff">Bright's disease</font></i>.
      I finally prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea sulphurica</font></i> l2th and under
      its action she immediately improved and made a very rapid and permanent recovery. Since then I
      have found it a good remedy in profuse suppurations in different kinds of cases. This is all I
      know about the remedy.</p>

      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">CALCAREA HYPOPHOSPHORICA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once had a case like this: A boy eight years of age had several (four or
      five) abscesses in and around the knee joint. The ulceration had also attacked the tibia,
      which was half eaten off, so that the ragged necrosed bone protruded through the surface
      plainly in sight. The little fellow was greatly emaciated, and had no appetite, and was pale
      as a corpse. I told the mother that I thought this was a case for the surgeon, but I would try
      to get him in better condition for the operation. I remembered reading years before of the
      cures of abscesses by this remedy, made by Dr. Searles, of Albany, and empirically concluded
      to try it in this case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I put him upon the first trituration, a grain a day. Called in a week and
      found a great change for the better. The mother exclaimed as I came in: "Ah, Doctor, the
      boys is eating us out of house and home." Under the continued use of the remedy he made a
      complete and rapid recovery, except that the tibia was a little bent. I have since used the
      remedy in some very large swellings where pus had formed, with the effect of complete
      absorption of the pus and no opening of the abscess on the surface. One was a case of hip
      disease which had been pronounced incurable by a <i><font color="#0000ff">specialist on
      ulcerations</font></i>, (How is that for a specialist, <i><font color="#0000ff">regular</font></i>
      at that.) The different combinations of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcareas</font></i>
      ought to be so thoroughly proven as to enable us to put them each in their exact place. So,
      also, with the <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalis, Magnesias, Natrums</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercuries</font></i>, etc.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The chief leading characteristic of this remedy is found in its skin
      symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Hoyne had expressed it nearly right. "Eruptions oozing out a thick,
      honey-like fluid." It may be found on any part of the body, but is especially found on or
      behind the ears, on head, face, genitals, or eyelids. I once treated a case of eczema of the
      legs which was of twenty years' standing. It was in an old obese woman, and, by the way, that
      is the kind of subject in which this remedy is found most efficacious.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I gave her, on account of much burning of the feet, a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Suphur</font></i> c. m. In two or three weeks an eruption was developed all
      over the body which exuded a glutinous, sticky fluid. One dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
      c. m., dry on the tongue, cured this as well as the eczema of the legs and left her skin as
      smooth as that of a child. This was years ago. Erysipelas sometimes takes this form, and in
      such cases recurs again and again. It will naturally occur to the physician that, because of
      this recurrence, there is some psoric taint which must be met by <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>.
      But we must not make the too common mistake of thinking that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      is the remedy on account of its great antipsoric powers, or on the often misleading indication
      "when seemingly indicated remedies don't act," because <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      is not the only anti-psoric and where <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> is
      indicated is not at all the anti-psoric for the case in hand. In short, we must not prescribe
      for psora (which is only a name after all) without indications any more than we would
      prescribe for the name scarlatina or diphtheria. <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
      is a powerful anti-psoric, as are also <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum, Lycopodium,
      Causticum</font></i> and many others. Symptoms must decide here, as elsewhere. In order to
      still further show the wonderful anti-psoric powers of this remedy I will give another case
      from practice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A child three years of age had eczema capitis. Under allopathic local
      treatment the eczema disappeared; but soon entero-colitis of a very obstinate character set
      in. Then the regulars could not "do" that as they had the eczema, and after they had
      given up the case, pronouncing it consumption of the bowels, the homœopath (myself) was
      called in on the ground that he could do no harm if he could do no good (so they said).</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Case</font></i>. -Child greatly emaciated, little or no appetite, very
      restless, and "<i><font color="#0000ff">stools brown fluid mixed with undigested
      substances, and of an intolerably fœtid odor</font></i>." Taking into the account the
      history of the suppressed eczema I prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
      6m. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Jenichen</font></i>) and in a short time a perfect cure was the
      result. <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> has a similar stool as was present in
      this case, but the eruptions of the two remedies are different and this one corresponded to <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>, hence <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> was
      ruled out. If this case of so long standing had not had the eruption I might have thought of <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> on account of the extreme weakness from long-continued drain
      or loss of fluid, for <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> is another remedy that has <i><font color="#0000ff">brown, loose, fœtid stools</font></i>. So we must take into consideration <i><font color="#0000ff">all the case</font></i>, psora and all. In chronic cases, in which <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> is likely to be the remedy, we may look for affections of
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">eyelids</font></i>, of the same eczematous character as that
      found on the head, behind the ears, etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Notice. -Eczema of lids, eruptions moist and fissured margins of lids
      covered with scales and crusts. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> lids the

      leads all the remedies for eczematous affections of the lids, <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i>
      stands next, but of course special indications, local or general, or both, must decide.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> is one of our best anal remedies. We have given the
      kind of loose stool characteristic of the drug. This is, however, exceptional, for it
      generally tends to constipation instead of diarrhœa. The <i><font color="#0000ff">stools</font></i>
      are <i><font color="#0000ff">knotty</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">large</font></i>,
      the lumps sometimes <i><font color="#0000ff">united</font></i> by <i><font color="#0000ff">mucous
      threads</font></i> and mucus often follow the stool. There is often eczema around the anus,
      and it is one of our best remedies for <i><font color="#0000ff">fissura ani</font></i>. There
      is in these cases apt to be much pain after stool, and much soreness in anus on wiping it. Now
      if all this should occur in subjects of this tendency to sticky eruptions, we should not
      hesitate to give <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> with expectations of success.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another very characteristic calling for this remedy is found in the <i><font color="#0000ff">nails</font></i>. Both finger and toe nails become thick, grow out of shape.
      Never forget <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> when you find this state of nails
      present. Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> has cracks or fissures in the
      ends of the fingers (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sarsaparilla</font></i>), nipples, labial
      commissures, of anus, and between toes (<i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i>). It is
      one of our best remedies for <i><font color="#0000ff">wens</font></i> found in persons of
      herpetic dyscrasia. Old, hard cicatrices soften up and go away under its action, especially
      those left by abscesses of the mammæ. Lumps in the breast of suspicious appearance also go
      away under the action of this remedy. In menstrual troubles it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, but there are plenty of points to differentiate them.
      In temperament it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ostrearum</font></i>; but in <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> the menses are mostly scanty and delayed, in <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i> too soon and too profuse; <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
      cures complaints of <i><font color="#0000ff">many kinds</font></i> when you have present two
      things:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st. The peculiar tendency to obesity.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2d. The characteristic glutinous eruptions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="PSORINUM"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The disease products are powerful remedies, and when used in the potentized
      form have made many wonderful cures. It is believed by some that in the potentized form they
      are so changed that they become homœopathic to the disease which produced them, especially in
      any other person than the one in whom the original disease existed.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have experimented more or less with these so-called nosodes, since they
      were so widely proclaimed by Dr. Swan. I never found them markedly efficacious in such cases,
      but I have seen remarkable results from them in cases resembling, for instance, gonorrhœal,
      syphilitic or psoric troubles, without any history of pre-existing trouble of the kind. I have
      cured eruptions on the skin resembling itch with <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>,
      rheumatic troubles that were very obstinate under our usual remedies with <i><font color="#0000ff">Medorrhinum</font></i> and a long-standing case of caries of the spine with <i><font color="#0000ff">Syphilinum</font></i>, but in not one of these cases had the patient, that I
      could trace, itch, gonorrhœa or syphilis. The experience of many others seems to be
      different. I give only my own. The each nosode seems capable of producing the same or similar
      symptoms when given by mouth in proving as when inoculated the usual way seems well proved in
      the case of <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>. I do not see why the constitutional
      symptoms appearing after inoculations should nor be considered a proving as well as those
      following a bee sting, Cantharis blistering, or the local external poisoning of the varieties
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>. If <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>, very
      high, will cure rhus poisoning, why should not <i><font color="#0000ff">Syphilinum</font></i>,
      etc., cure syphilis? Who will answer?</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">All nosodes are as capable of curing as they are of poisoning. If not, why
      not? We must not let prejudice hinder honest investigation. As if in corroboration of the
      theory that the potentized disease product will cure the disease producing it, the <i><font color="#0000ff">provings</font></i> of <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> indicate
      that the chief action and curative power of the poison is upon the skin. And is it not
      remarkable that <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> should so strongly resemble <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, the old-time remedy for itch, and again that they follow
      or complement each other in curing skin troubles? Notice some of the leading skin symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Itching when the body becomes warm."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Itching, intolerable in warmth of bed." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. sol</font></i>.)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Itching scratches until it bleeds."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Itching between fingers and in bends of joints." (Sepia).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Dry, scaly eruptions which disappear summers and return
      winters."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Repeated outbreaks of eruptions."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Skin has a dirty dingy look</font></i>, as
      if the patient <i><font color="#0000ff">never washed</font></i>, and the body has a <i><font color="#0000ff">filthy smell</font></i> even after a bath." These and many other
      symptoms, too numerous to mention here, show what an invaluable remedy this should be in skin
      troubles, and abundant experience and observation corroborate the truth of our law of cure in
      the curative power of disease poisons, as it also does in vegetable, and mineral and insect or
      animal.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> is also found useful in the consequences of suppressed
      eruptions, and in such cases should never be forgotten when other anti-psoric fail. Dr. Wm. A.
      Hawley, of Syracuse, N. Y., once made a brilliant cure of a very bad case of dropsy in an old
      woman, being led to prescribe this remedy by the appearance of the skin. One dose of Fincke's
      42m. potency, dry on the tongue, cured the whole case in a very short time. It was a case of
      long standing. Now, if we examine we will also find that this remedy resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> in many points. A close comparison will pay the earnest
      student of Materia Medica. <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> is <i><font color="#0000ff">very depressed</font></i> in mind. "Greatest despondency, making his own
      life and that of those about him almost intolerable." This state of mind, following acute
      diseases, like typhus, is especially benefited by this remedy. When writing of <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> we mentioned the resemblance of the two remedies in the
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">stools, dark-brown, watery</font></i>, and of <i><font color="#0000ff">intolerably</font></i> offensive odor." This is found in bad cases of
      cholera infantum or chronic diarrhœa. There is one valuable diagnostic difference between
      them, although the remedies are so much alike, and that is that the <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
      moisture from the eruption is <i><font color="#0000ff">glutinous</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">sticky</font></i> and not markedly so with <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> is very useful for
      weakness or debility during convalescence from severe acute diseases. The patient <i><font color="#0000ff">sweats profusely</font></i> when taking the least exercise. Notwithstanding,
      as a rule, the skin is generally <i><font color="#0000ff">dry</font></i>, inactive, and rarely
      sweats. Here, again, as in the stool symptom, choice may have to be made between <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>. Loss of
      fluids, blood, suppuration, etc., would decide in favor of the latter and itching eruptions or
      tendency thereto, before or during the sickness, the former. One thing I forgot to mention in
      connection with the offensive stool. "All excretions, diarrhœa, leucorrhœa, menstrual
      flow and perspiration, have a carrion-like smell, even the body has a filthy smell,
      notwithstanding frequent bathing." The <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>
      subject is <i><font color="#0000ff">very sensitive to cold air</font></i>, or change of
      weather (<i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i>), wants to wear a fur cap, overcoat or
      shawl, even in the hottest weather.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Chronic complaints following or dating back for years to some imperfectly
      cured or suppressed acute disease. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>.) I advise
      everyone to buy a copy of Allen's "key-notes," which has a very good rendering of
      the nosodes. So we see in <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> when <i><font color="#0000ff">proven</font></i> a great remedy for very grave conditions. I have no doubt
      that all nosodes are equally valuable when as well understood.</p>

      Strange that this noble metal, for which mankind strives for its pecuniary value, should, when
      taken into the organism, cause the greatest unhappiness.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The Aurum patient is plunged into the deepest gloom and despair. Life is a
      burden, he <i><font color="#0000ff">desires</font></i> death. Suicide dwells constantly in his
      mind. In men, I have observed it oftenest in connection with liver troubles. In women, with
      womb troubles, especially when enlarged, indurated or prolapsed. In both these cases, the
      result, so far as local conditions are concerned, seems to be from repeated attacks of
      congestion to the parts, which ends in hypertrophy. The liver in enlarged the womb also, and
      prolapsus occurs from the very weight of the organs. These congestions, so characteristic of
      the remedy, take place also in head, heart, chest and kidneys; but, whenever they come, the
      peculiar mind symptoms are always present to furnish the chief indication for <i><font color="#0000ff">Gold</font></i>. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Gold</font></i> patient is also
      at times "peevish and vehement, the least contradiction excites his wrath." He will
      exhibit these outbreaks occasionally, even when the more characteristic depression and gloom
      greatly preponderate. Other remedies have a similar depression and tendency to suicide, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Naja</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>, but none
      in anything like the <i><font color="#0000ff">degree</font></i> of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i>.
      I once cured a young lady who tried to commit suicide by drowning. After she was cured she
      laughed at the occurrence, and said she could not help it. It seemed to her she was of no use
      in the world. She <i><font color="#0000ff">felt</font></i> so.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> has been found efficacious in curing some bone affections
      of syphilitic origin, especially if such cases had been the subjects of old school dosing with
      Mercury. <i><font color="#0000ff">There would be a great falling off of business for
      physicians if the old school could learn to cure their patients without poisoning them with
      their drugs</font></i>. The locality where <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> has made
      its best record in these syphilitico-mercurial affections is in caries of the bones (caries of
      long bones, <i><font color="#0000ff">Fluoric acid, Angustura</font></i>), of the nose and
      palate, also of the mastoid process. In these nasal troubles it is sometimes of great use in
      the catarrh, or ozœna, before the trouble has progressed to actual caries. The nostrils are
      agglutinated, ulcerated, and nose obstructed and filled with crusts, or there are excessively
      fetid discharges, and the patient is melancholy and disposed to suicide. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> is one of the few remedies that has hemiopia or half-sight,
      and has cured it even in the 200th potency. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> and
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Lithium carbonicum</font></i> also have half-sight, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> sees only the lower, while the other two see only the left
      half of objects.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> not only causes and cures indurations of the womb in the
      female, but indurations also of the testicles in the male, and in both cases de ever-present
      mental symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> or the syphilitico-mercurial
      history furnish the chief indications for its use. In fatty heart, in ruddy, corpulent, old
      people it is one of our best remedies. In these cases there is much vascular disturbance.
      "Violent palpitation, with anxiety and congestion in the chest and visible beating of the
      carotids and temporal arteries".</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">

      goes deeper and is more lasting in its effect. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> is
      one of our best remedies for <i><font color="#0000ff">bone pains</font></i>. Never forget it.
      It ranks with <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali iodide</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Asafœtida</font></i>
      and the <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercuries</font></i> in periostical affections.</p>
