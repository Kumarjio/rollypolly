      <p align="JUSTIFY">Guernsey says: "We think of this remedy on seeing a withered and dried
      up person, <i><font color="#0000ff">made so by disease</font></i>." This especially in
      children. "He looks like a little withered old man." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Fluoric
      acid</font></i>, young people look old.) <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum</font></i> like <i><font color="#0000ff">Gold</font></i> profoundly affects the mind. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Gold</font></i>
      it is one of the best remedies for hypochondriasis. The symptoms are so many in this trouble
      that we can only call attention to them as found in <i><font color="#0000ff">Guiding Symptoms</font></i>.
      I will only mention a few more prominent and peculiar symptoms that have been frequently
      verified. "The sight of high houses makes him dizzy and causes him to stagger. It seemed
      as if the houses on both sides of the street would approach and crush him."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"When walking in the street he dreads to pass a street corner, because
      the corner of the house seems to project and he is afraid he will run against it."
      Impulsive, must walk very fast, always hurried. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium tigrinum</font></i>.)
      "Apprehension when ready to go to church or opera; brings on diarrhea." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The hurried feeling of both <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium tigrinum</font></i> have occurred mostly in uterine
      troubles; while the diarrhœa on excitement seems to depend upon a general nervous condition.
      Unless the indications pointed strongly to one in preference to the other remedy it might be
      well to try the vegetable first. The minerals are generally longer and deeper in their action,
      and would perhaps be preferable the more chronic the case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Some of the very curious symptoms found under this and other remedies are
      not found in everyday practice, but when found are all the more valuable because the cases
      presenting them are rare and not easily understood or cured by the ordinary remedies. Some of
      our most brilliant cures have been made in just such cases, and they are very gratifying to
      both physician and patient.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> is sometimes the best remedy for hemicrania;
      this kind of headache is often very distressing and hard to cure. One peculiar symptom
      belonging to <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> in headache is a feeling of
      <i><font color="#0000ff">expansion</font></i>, feels as though head were enormously enlarged,
      and like <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>,
      feels better when <i><font color="#0000ff">tied up tight</font></i>. This feeling of expansion
      is also a general symptom, feels as though the whole body or part of it were expanding, some
      express it as a feeling of fullness. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus hipocastanum</font></i>).
      It is found under other remedies also, but very prominently under this.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> has a great deal of <i><font color="#0000ff">vertigo</font></i>,
      which is often accompanied with buzzing in the ears, general debility and trembling. Cannot
      walk with the eyes closed; the sight of high houses makes him dizzy. These symptoms call to
      remembrance <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>. Both remedies have much vertigo;
      great tremulous weakness, accompanied with general debility, actual trembling and tremulous
      sensation, and both have been found useful in locomotor ataxia. I should, other things being
      equal, give the preference to <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> in recent cases,
      or in the beginning, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> further along.
      But there are generally diagnostic indications which enable us to choose between them. In eye
      affections <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum</font></i> is one of our most valuable remedies,
      and like all remedies which are very valuable for anything has been woefully abused by the old
      school. It is a pity that they do not know enough to get the good and to avoid the bad effects
      of such valuable agents, for many times the disastrous results of their misuse brings the
      remedies into such disrepute that others are afraid to use them at all. It was for this reason
      that the old botanics rejected all mineral remedies. Mercury had so scared them. It falls to
      the Homœopath to teach how to use all such a way as to get the good, while avoiding the bad
      effects. In eye troubles Allen &amp; Norton write as follows: "The greatest service that <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> performs is in purulent ophthalmia. With large
      experience, in both hospital and private practice, we have not lost a single eye from this
      disease, and every one has been treated with <i><font color="#0000ff">internal remedies</font></i>,
      most of them with <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> of a high potency,
      30th or 200th. We have witnessed the most intense chemosis, with strangulated vessels, most
      profuse purulent discharge, even the cornea beginning to get hazy and looking as though it
      would slough, subside rapidly under <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i>
      internally. The subjective symptoms are almost none. Their very absence, with the <i><font color="#0000ff">profuse purulent</font></i> discharge, and the swollen lids from a collection
      of pus in the eye, or swelling of the sub-conjunctival tissue of the lids themselves,
      indicates the drug. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Apis; Rhus</font></i>.)", Later Norton
      writes: "I do believe that there is no need of cauterization with it except in the <i><font color="#0000ff">gonorrhœal</font></i> form of purulent conjunctivitis." Such testimony
      from such sources ought to shame the abuse of this agent in the hands of old school
      physicians, and sometimes bogus Homœopaths. In ophthalmia neonatorum in my own practice as a
      general practitioner I have had very often better success with <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius
      solubilis</font></i>, especially where there was much purulent matter pouring out on opening
      the eyes. In blepharitis <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> have served me oftener than <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum
      nitricum</font></i>, but this may not be the experience of others, for in eye troubles, as in
      all others, the indications are to be studied and carefully recognized in their entirety. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i> must not be forgotten in blepharitis.) Specialists are apt to
      lose sight of this and be led to local treatment when constitutional would be infinitely
      better. The symptom, "red, painful tip of the tongue, papillæ erect, prominent,"
      has guided to the cure of many different kinds of cases. There are also some valuable symptoms
      in the digestive organs; for instance, "<i><font color="#0000ff">Irresistible desire for
      sugar</font></i>; fluids go right through him; most gastric ailments are accompanied by
      belching; belching after every meal, stomach as if it would burst with wind, belching
      difficult; finally air rushes out <i><font color="#0000ff">with great noise and violence</font></i>."
      All of these are characteristic, and there is no doubt that this remedy is sometimes indicated
      when <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg., China</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      are given because they are generally so much better understood. Dyspepsia, gastralgia and even
      gastric ulcer have sometimes found a powerful remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum</font></i>,
      and it has also done great good in very obstinate cases of diarrhœa of various kinds.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Green mucus <i><font color="#0000ff">like chopped spinach in flakes</font></i>."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stool turning green after remaining in diaper."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stool expelled with much spluttering."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stool shreddy, red, green muco-lymph, epithelial substance."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"During stool emission of much noisy flatus."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now there are other remedies which have some of these symptoms in a marked
      degree, notably: <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phos</font></i>., which has the spluttering
      stool with much noisy flatus, and it is also a fact that both remedies are very valuable ones
      in hydrocephaloid consequent on the long-continued drain from intractable cases of
      entero-colitis. If the bone development should be slow with open fontanelles and sweaty head
      of course <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phos</font></i>., would win. Then in <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phos</font></i>. the child wishes smoked meats, bacon, etc., in <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> sugar or sweets. Yet both have great emaciation,
      the child looking old and wrinkled, and it will sometimes be close individualizing to choose
      between them. <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> has its place in the
      treatment of throat affections. There is thick, tenacious mucus in the throat obliging him to
      hawk and causing slight hoarseness. Rawness, soreness, scraping in throat, causing hawking and
      cough. Sensation as of a splinter lodged in the throat (<i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric ac.,
      Hepar sulph., Dolichos</font></i>). and wartlike excrescences, which feel like pointed bodies
      when swallowing. This kind of throat may extend downward until it involves the larynx,
      especially in singers, clergymen, or lawyers who are using their voice very much. Then it is
      doubly indicated. When we come to the back and extremities we again find our remedy in the
      field for a share of the honors. "Pain in the back (small of) relieve when standing or
      walking, but severe when rising from a seat," is a condition often found in practice. I
      have often relieved it with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>, but remember also <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum
      nitricum</font></i>. If in back troubles we find great <i><font color="#0000ff">lassitude</font></i>
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carbonicum</font></i>), with weariness, especially in forearms
      and lower legs, especially calves, or if in addition to this we find vertigo and trembling of
      the extremities, we may be sure <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i> will do
      us good. In paraplegia from debilitating causes or paralysis after diphtheria we may find this
      remedy indicated. Also in epilepsy or convulsions; in the former (epilepsy) one characteristic
      symptom is that for hours or days <i><font color="#0000ff">before the attack</font></i> the
      pupils are dilated; in the latter the convulsions are preceded for a short time by great
      restlessness.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum metallicum</font></i> has great restlessness <i><font color="#0000ff">between</font></i> the attacks. Finally <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      muriaticum</font></i> is the best antidote for the abuse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum
      nit</font></i>., especially upon mucous surfaces.</p>

      sitting still; &gt; <i><font color="#0000ff">walking slowly around</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is another one of the abused remedies. It stands with the old school
      for anæmia, as does <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i> for malaria. Each can and
      does cure its kind of both conditions, but can cure no other; and each, when it is the true
      curative, is capable of doing its best work in the potentized form. Dr. Hughes writes
      "The treatment of anæmia by <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> is one of the <b><font color="#ff0000">few</font></b> satisfactory and certain things in modern medicine. From
      whatever cause this condition may arise, whether it be the chlorosis of defective
      menstruation, or the simple poverty of blood induced by hæmorrhages, deficiency of air,
      light, and suitable food, or by exhausting diseases, <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i>
      is the one great remedy." I must say that I think that a man who would write like that of
      any remedy is not to be blamed for talking of the few satisfactory and certain things in
      modern medicine. <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> is no more of a panacea for anæmia
      than is <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i> for malaria or <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphate
      of Lime</font></i> for deficient bone development. My experience has taught me that there are
      several other equally efficient remedies for these conditions and that when they are not
      indicated they not only cannot cure but do injure every time they are prescribed, especially
      in the material doses in which they are generally recommended by such teachers. I must here
      state my experience founded on abundant practice and observation that such prescribing is not
      only un-Hahnemannian, but in every sense un-homœopathic, and I warn all beginners not to
      practice along that line or they too will come to talk of the few satisfactory and certain
      things in modern medicine. Now we have given this quotation from Dr. Hughes, it is only fair
      to him to quote him again, inasmuch as he, in this latter quotation, talks more sensibly.
      Talking about anæmia, he says "The malady does not ordinarily arise from any failure of
      the quantity of iron supplied in the food. If the element is deficient in the blood the fault
      lies in the assimilative processes. But Reveil has ascertained that in anæmia there is no
      change whatever in the amount of iron present in the blood. However few the corpuscles they
      contain within them the full proportion of the metal normal to health, and though under the
      influence of iron itself they increase to double and triple their number they yield no more
      iron." Then Cowperthwaite adds: "It is also true that when irons is introduced into
      the system in large quantities with a view to supplying a deficiency of iron in the blood that
      it is not assimilated, but may be almost entirely obtained from the fæces, having been
      eliminated by the intestines. It is evident, therefore, that iron does not act as a curative
      agent by virtue of its absorption as a constituent of the blood, but rather, as we are led to
      conclude, from its physiological effects upon the organs and tissues of the body, that it owes
      its therapeutic virtues to the same essential dynamic agency possessed by other drugs, and its
      application is subject to the same therapeutic law." Sound words, these; then let no man
      prescribe <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> or any other remedy for anæmia, or any
      other disease, without <i><font color="#0000ff">indications</font></i> according to our
      therapeutic law of cure. I have seen better cures of bad cases of anæmia by <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum muriaticum</font></i> in potentized form than I ever did from <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> in any form, although <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i>
      has its cases, as have also <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla, Cyclamen, Calcarea phos.,
      Carbo veg., China</font></i> and many other remedies. We will now call attention to the
      symptoms that indicate <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> in anæmia or any other
      condition where <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> is the remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Ashy, pale or greenish face, with pain or
      other symptoms the face becomes bright red</font></i>." (Raue). "<i><font color="#0000ff">The least emotion or exertion causes a red, flushed face</font></i>."
      (Guernsey.) "<i><font color="#0000ff">Rush of blood to head; veins of head swollen;
      flushes of heat in the face</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Hammering,
      beating, pulsating pains in the head</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bell, China,
      Natrum mur., Glon</font></i>.)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Great paleness of mucous membranes,
      especially that of the cavity of the mouth</font></i>." (Raue.) "<i><font color="#0000ff">Always better from walking about, notwithstanding weakness obliges patient to
      lie down</font></i>." (Guernsey.) "<i><font color="#0000ff">Menses too soon, too
      profuse, too long lasting, with fiery red face, ringing in the ears (China), flow pale, watery
      and debilitating</font></i>." Now if in addition to these symptoms you have,
      notwithstanding the general anæmic condition of the patient, frequent rushes of blood to the
      head, chest, face, or other local congestions you have a typical <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i>
      case and may confidently expect a cure if given in potency and at proper intervals. But if
      your patient has been already "loaded up" with <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i>
      on the theory that the blood must be "fed" with it, the fact is, generally that she
      is suffering from the over-dosing more than from the original disease and you will proceed to
      find the best antidote, guided by the symptoms here as elsewhere, and, in adapting such remedy
      to the case as it <i><font color="#0000ff">is</font></i>, will often be able to cure both the
      natural and drug disease together.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is a blessed thing that this is so, for if the <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>,
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> and other medicinal cachexia stalking about in our
      midst were not curable, we would be a sorry spectacle as human beings if allopathic dosing
      were allowed to go on. Now while we are talking about this so-called blood remedy we will
      speak about its general hæmorrhagic tendencies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These local congestions so characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i>
      are attended by hæmorrhages from nose, lungs, womb, kidneys, etc., hence it becomes one of
      our best remedies for hæmorrhages in anæmia or debilitated subjects with the peculiar
      symptoms before mentioned. In the form of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ferrum phos</font></i>., of
      which we have already written, taking the fact that both remedies entering into the
      combination have decided hæmorrhagic tendencies, it becomes doubly effective in this sphere.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But <i><font color="#0000ff">Iron</font></i> is not by any means confined
      in its usefulness to blood troubles, and we will notice briefly some other uses of this
      valuable curative agent. In disorders of stomach and bowels it becomes sometimes the only
      remedy, and has some peculiar and characteristic symptoms indicating it here.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"<i><font color="#0000ff">Canine hunger (China), alternating with
      complete loss of appetite</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Regurgitation of
      food, or eructations after eating</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Wants bread
      and butter; meat disagrees</font></i> (opposite <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.)
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Beer or tea also disagrees. Food lies in the stomach all day and is
      vomited at night</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Bowels feel sore as if they
      had been bruised, or as if he had taken cathartics; undigested, painless stools at night, or
      while eating or drinking</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Croton tig., China</font></i>).
      These and many other symptoms show its value here, and it is noticeable, the resemblances of
      this remedy to <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>. There is sometimes difficulty in
      choosing between them, but there is more <i><font color="#0000ff">flatulence</font></i> with <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>. Both remedies have, markedly, lienteria and painless diarrhœa.
      These two remedies both antidote and complement each other under certain circumstances. They
      should be studied in comparison as <i><font color="#0000ff">debility</font></i> remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Next to the easily flushed and red face as a characteristic symptom stands
      this -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Walking slowly about relieves</font></i>." (One
      other remedy has this general characteristic almost, if not equally strong, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>). This is true of the general restlessness, of the great
      weakness also; he feels better walking slower about, even though he is so weak he has to sit
      down every little while to rest; pain in the hip joint drives out of bed and is only relieved
      while walking slowly. I once had a rather pale lady come to me for treatment for pains in the
      forearms; after prescribing for her for a week, she let drop this symptom, that the only way
      in which she could get relief nights (when the pain was almost unbearable) was by getting

      Palpitation of the heart, hæmoptysis and asthma are also relieved in the same way by walking
      slowly about. It would seem hardly possible that such complaints could be so relieved, but
      there are many such curious and unaccountable symptoms in our Materia Medica which have become
      reliable leaders to the prescription of certain remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Ferrum is one of our best remedies for cough with vomiting of food. It is
      also one of the very few remedies having a <i><font color="#0000ff">red face during chill</font></i>,
      and has more than once led to the cure of intermittent fever on that symptom. Again it is one
      of the remedies found in intermittents that have been abused by <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>.
      In these cases we often find the splenic region sore on pressure and much swollen.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Notwithstanding the very extensive provings, this remedy has not been so
      useful as it would seem it should be. One symptom has proved to be very characteristic and has
      led to its successful administration in different diseases, viz.: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Abdomen retracted to the spine as if drown in by a string</font></i>." In
      this symptom there is both, or either, actual retraction and <i><font color="#0000ff">sensation</font></i>
      of retraction in the abdomen. Excessive pain in abdomen radiating to all parts of the body (<i><font color="#0000ff">Dioscorea</font></i>). It is found mostly in colic, but may be found in
      uterine troubles, such as menorrhagia, etc. Also in constipation. H. N. Guernsey claimed great
      powers for it in jaundice; whites of eyes, skin, stool and urine all are very yellow, and I
      have prescribed it with success. Its power to produce paralysis is well known, and it is owing
      to this power that lead colic is induced, which is one of the most distressing and dangerous
      of diseases. I cured one case of post diphtheritic paralysis with it. It was a very severe
      case in a middle-aged man. His lower limbs were entirely paralyzed, and there was at the same
      time a symptom which I never met before, nor have I since, in such a case, viz., excessive
      hyperæsthesia of the skin. He could not bear to be touched anywhere, it hurt him so. After
      much hunting I found this hyperæsthesia perfectly pictured in Allen's Encyclopædia, and
      that, taken together with the paralysis, seemed to be good reason for prescribing <i><font color="#0000ff">Plumbum</font></i>, which I did in one dose of Fincke's 40m. with the result
      of bringing about rapid and continuous improvement until a perfect cure was reached. He took
      only the one dose, for a repetition was not necessary.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The father-in-law of Dr. T. L. Brown, over seventy years of age, was
      attacked with a severe pain in the abdomen. Finally, a large, hard swelling developed in the
      ileo-cæcal region very sensitive to contact or to the least motion. It began to assume a
      bluish color, and on account of his age and extreme weakness it was thought that he must die.
      His daughter, however, studied up the case, and found in Raue's Pathology the indications for <i><font color="#0000ff">Plumbum</font></i> as given in therapeutic hints for typhlitis. It was
      administered in the 200th potency, which was followed by relief and perfect recovery.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">The center of action of this remarkable remedy is in the liver, and its
      most characteristic symptom is a <i><font color="#0000ff">fixed pain</font></i> (dull or
      sharp) <i><font color="#0000ff">under the lower inner angle of the right shoulder blade</font></i>.
      This very characteristic symptom may be found in connection with general jaundice, cough,
      diarrhœa, pneumonia, menses, loss of milk, exhaustion, etc., in fact, no matter what the name
      of the disease this symptom present should always bring to mind <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>
      and close scouting will generally reveal hepatic troubles or complications as would be
      naturally expected with such a remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> is like
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>, by preference, a right-sided remedy, right
      supra-orbital neuralgia, right hypochondrium and scorbiculum cordis tense and painful to
      pressure; right-sided pneumonia and shoulder painful; shooting pain in right hip extending
      into abdomen; drawing pain in hips, thighs, legs, or feet, more right-sided; right foot cold
      as ice, left natural. Further study will show that <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>
      not only is a right-sided remedy, but in many other points stands close to <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>, and in my experience one is often found indicated after
      the other. Although this characteristic infra-scapular pain is as reliable as any in the
      Materia Medica, there may be cases in which it does not appear at all, which can only be cured
      by <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>, especially liver and lung trouble. If we
      should find pressive pain in the region of the liver, whether it be enlarged and sensitive to
      pressure or not, bitter taste in the mouth, tongue <i><font color="#0000ff">coated thickly
      yellow, with red margins showing imprint of the teeth</font></i>, yellowness of whites of
      eyes, face, hands and skin; stools gray, clay colored, or <i><font color="#0000ff">yellow as
      gold</font></i>, urine also yellow as gold, lemon colored or dark brown, leaving a yellow
      color on vessel when emptied out, loss of appetite, disgust and nausea, or vomiting of bilious
      matter, and especially if patient could retain nothing but hot drinks on the stomach, we would
      have a clear case for <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> even though the
      infra-scapular pain were absent. All these symptoms might be found in either a chronic or
      acute case. If in a chronic case, some anti-psoric like <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      might have to be called in, according to indications, of course, to help complete a cure, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> would be the chief reliance.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These liver troubles range from simple congestion and inflammation of the
      organ, to the more severe and deep-seated affections like fatty liver, gall stones, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> is one of the leading remedies in pneumonia, which is
      complicated with liver symptoms. Sometimes in coughs which are persistent with much pain
      through right side of chest and into shoulder, <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>
      helps us out and saves the patient from what might easily terminate in consumption.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">When writing of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum metallicum</font></i> we
      might have said something of this combination as a remedy for jaundice or liver troubles.
      Several years ago I was troubled with frequent attacks of derangement of the liver
      characterized by, first, a white fæcal stool for several days in succession, with dullness of
      the head, bad tasting mouth, coated tongue, fullness and pain in right side and shoulder, and
      jaundiced skin. This would either culminate in an attack of bilious vomiting and diarrhœa, or
      in fæcal stools as black as tar, for several days in succession, with gradual relief of the
      general bilious symptoms. I tried various remedies, as well as I was able to choose them,
      among which were <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius, Leptandra, Podophyllum, Lycopodium</font></i>
      and others, with nothing more than temporary relief, and sometimes not even that. While on a
      visit to New York City, I called upon Dr. M. Baruch, partly to see the man who had been
      reported to me as both very skillful as a prescriber and eccentric as a man. During my call I
      stated to him my case. He prescribed for me a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum
      muriaticum natronatum</font></i> 1000th, followed by a powder each of <i><font color="#0000ff">Veronica
      officinalis</font></i> 500th, 200th and 30th, and directed me to take them in the order named
      once in sixty hours and said: "In three months you will be well." I took the powders
      as directed and have never been troubled in that way since. Since then I have prescribed the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum muriaticum natronatum</font></i> for some obstinate cases of jaundice,
      with the alternating white and black stools, and have been successful in relieving them.</p>

      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">While writing on <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum muriaticum natronatum</font></i>
      I mentioned <i><font color="#0000ff">Veronica</font></i> with which Dr. Baruch followed that
      remedy in the cure of my own case. After returning home I tried to find the two remedies.
      Found <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum muriaticum natronatum</font></i> in Hering's Guiding
      Symptoms, and, although meager, had something to go by in treating other cases, with the
      result there mentioned. But I could find no <i><font color="#0000ff">Veronica</font></i>
      proven unless it was the <i><font color="#0000ff">Leptandra</font></i>, which is one of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Veronica</font></i> tribe. So the next time I saw Dr. Baruch I asked him if it
      was the <i><font color="#0000ff">Leptandra</font></i> that he gave me, and he said, "No,
      it was the <i><font color="#0000ff">Veronica officinalis</font></i>" (common Speedwell).
      It is not found in our Materia Medica as yet. There is no doubt the <i><font color="#0000ff">Veronicas</font></i>
      and especially the <i><font color="#0000ff">Leptandra</font></i> are good liver remedies, but
      aside from the alternate ashy and black stools we have nothing very definite to guide us to
      their selection. The only two provings made were with the alkaloid, and that in too low
      preparations to be of much value. I once succeeded with <i><font color="#0000ff">Leptandra</font></i>
      in curing, or at least she improved until she was well, a lady very sick with what was called
      by her former physician typhoid fever. The following indications which I found in Jahr's
      Clinical Guide (by Lilienthal, first edition) led to its prescription. Symptoms: -"Great
      prostration, stupor, heat and dryness of skin, calor mordax or coldness of the extremities, <i><font color="#0000ff">dark, fetid, tarry</font></i>, or watery stools mixed with bloody mucus, and a
      jaundiced skin." Otherwise I have never seen any marked benefit from this remedy in any
      case. Still I believe it to be capable, with scientific proving, in potency, of developing
      great curative powers. If I might, in this short notice, inspire some young physicians to
      thoroughly prove it I should not have written in vain.</p>

      through the hips. Guernsey says: "A great many old troubles in the back. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sufferings in the back aggravated by fatigue</font></i>." One might say
      all these symptoms are found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. True, but in
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis</font></i> cases they all come from or are in connection
      with kidney or urinary troubles, <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. seldom so. The
      pains extend often into the bladder and urethra, and the urine itself is changed. It may have
      a turbid, flocculent, clay-like, copious, mucous sediment, or a reddish, mealy sediment, or be
      blood-red, but the persistent pains in the back are the leading indications. It is especially
      to be thought of in arthritic and rheumatic affections, when these back symptoms connected
      with urinary alterations are present. One very characteristic symptom is a <i><font color="#0000ff">bubbling sensation</font></i> in the region of the kidneys. Another is <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness</font></i> in region of kidneys when jumping out of a wagon or

      troubles of <i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis</font></i> a great deal of prostration or a
      sense of weakness across the back, and the face looks pale, earthy complexion, with sunken

      are often seriously affected by it. Some are unable to work in it. In the <i><font color="#0000ff">Turpentine</font></i> kidney troubles there is apt to be more strangury than
      with <i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis</font></i> and more blood in the urine. The urine
      becomes brown, black, or <i><font color="#0000ff">smoky</font></i> in appearance from more or
      less admixture of blood. For burning and smarting on passing urine, <i><font color="#0000ff">Turpentine</font></i>

      <i><font color="#0000ff">sativa</font></i> than it does to <i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis</font></i>.
      All four may be found useful in the first stage of albuminuria, <i><font color="#0000ff">Turpentine</font></i>
      taking the lead, and it may sometimes require considerable study to choose between them. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius corrosivus</font></i> generally comes in a little later. <i><font color="#0000ff">Terebinth</font></i>. is one of our best anti-hæmorrhagic remedies.
      Hæmaturia, hæmoptysis, and hæmorrhage from the bowels, especially in typhoid, and even in
      purpura hæmorrhagica it may do splendid work. One of the chief characteristics for its use is
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">smooth, glossy, red tongue</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Crotalus,
      Pyrogen</font></i>); another is <i><font color="#0000ff">excessive tympanites</font></i>.
      These two symptoms are often found in typhoids, and then <i><font color="#0000ff">Terebinth</font></i>.
      is the remedy. Dropsy after scarlatina, with smoky urine, may find its remedy here, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis, Apis, Helleborus niger</font></i>, or <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i>

      affections as a local application. I have seen some bad effects from its use in that way for
      the chest in pneumonia in their hands. I would not recommend it.</p>
