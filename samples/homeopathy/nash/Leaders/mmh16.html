      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is another remedy having a strong action on the urinary organs,
      particularly upon the urinary tract or urethra. It is the remedy par excellence with which to
      begin the treatment of gonorrhœa unless some other remedy is particularly indicated, and such
      cases are very few. The most characteristic symptom <i><font color="#0000ff">is that the
      urethra is very sensitive to touch or external pressure</font></i>. The patient cannot walk
      with his legs close together because any pressure along the tract hurts him so. If the disease
      has extended up the urethra, or into the bladder, there will often be severe pains in the back
      every few minutes and the urine may be bloody. I used in my early practice to put five drops
      mother tincture into four ounces of water (in a four-ounce vial) and let the patient take a
      teaspoonful three times a day. After about four days the inflammatory symptoms would have
      subsided, and the thin discharge have thickened and become greenish in appearance. Then <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius solubilis</font></i> 3d trituration, a powder three times a day,
      would often finish the case. Or if a little, thin, gleety discharge remained, I cured that
      with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur, Capsicum</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      iodide</font></i>. I have cured many cases in from one to two weeks this way. Later I have
      used the c. m. potency in the first stage, and sometimes never have to use the second remedy.
      If I do, <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius corrosivus</font></i> c. m. is generally the
      remedy. Sometimes <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla, Sulphur</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> to finish up de case. There are exceptions, but the rule is
      that cases get well promptly under this treatment. After <i><font color="#0000ff">Cannabis
      sativa, Mercurius corrosivus</font></i>, if the discharge is thick and green, if the burning
      continues. <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i>
      if the discharge is thick and bland. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> for gleet. Of
      course I have not mentioned all of the remedies that are necessary in this disease. I used
      them all in the c. m., and I know, having. tried both, that they cure better than the low
      potencies. There is one curious symptom I have several times removed by this remedy, namely, a
      sense of dropping, around, or in the region of the heart. I do not know its pathological
      signification, but it is very annoying and the patient is very grateful to be rid of it.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">The grand central characteristic of this remedy is found in the urine,
      which is scanty, of a <i><font color="#0000ff">dark brown color</font></i> (like French
      brandy), <i><font color="#0000ff">the urinous odor being highly intensified</font></i>. This
      odor comes at the <i><font color="#0000ff">time of passing</font></i> and remains afterward.
      One need not wait on a long-standing specimen to find it. It is found in connection with
      rheumatism, quinsy, dropsy, diarrhœa, headache and other diseases. Of course many other
      remedies have offensive urine, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric acid</font></i> urine
      offensive like <i><font color="#0000ff">horse</font></i> urine, <i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis</font></i>,
      but the deposit is turbid, <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ostrearum</font></i>, but the
      deposit is white. <i><font color="#0000ff">Benzoic acid</font></i> often smells horribly, with
      no deposit at all. Both <i><font color="#0000ff">Benzoic acid</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis</font></i> are great remedies for arthritic troubles with the urinary
      symptoms. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lithium
      carb</font></i>. also claim attention in this affection, the concomitants deciding the choice.
      I have seen wonderful relief from <i><font color="#0000ff">Benzoic acid</font></i> in
      nephritic colic with the characteristic offensive urine. In dribbling of urine of old men with
      enlarged prostrate it has also done good service. The urine in the clothing scents the whole
      room. Menstrual difficulties and prolapsus uteri with the characteristic urinary symptoms are.
      also relieved by it. Heart troubles of rheumatic origin also. So we have a widely diversified
      list of diseases in which this remedy is <i><font color="#0000ff">the one</font></i>, and all
      seem to be connected with this one strong characteristic symptom.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="SARSAPARILLA"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sarsaparilla is another remedy which has excruciating neuralgia of the
      kidneys. Renal colic and passage of gravel and formation of vesicle calculi. Dr. Hering gives
      many testimonials to the efficacy of this remedy to relieve the sufferings attendant on
      gravel, especially with rheumatic symptoms. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> <i><font color="#0000ff">has red sand with clear urine; Sarsaparilla</font></i> white sand with scanty,
      slimy or flaky urine. They may both be very useful in chronic rheumatic troubles, with these
      urinary complications. The most characteristic symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sarsaparilla</font></i>
      is "<i><font color="#0000ff">much pain at the conclusion of passing</font></i> urine;
      almost unbearable." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis, Equisetum, Medorrhinum, Thuja</font></i>.).
      There is often in this case great tenesmus of the bladder at the same time. No remedy has this
      symptom so strongly as <i><font color="#0000ff">Sarsaparilla. Pulsatilla</font></i> has
      something similar, so far as tenesmus is concerned, in connection with <i><font color="#0000ff">enlarged prostrate</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum muriaticum</font></i>
      has also, -"After urination burning and cutting in the urethra; spasmodic contraction in
      abdomen, etc." So we must be careful about prescribing on one symptom alone, be it ever
      so prominent. In marasmus <i><font color="#0000ff">Sarsaparilla</font></i> stands alongside of
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine, Natrum mur</font></i>., and <i><font color="#0000ff">Abrotanum</font></i>.

      from below upward.) <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i>, general emaciation, wishes to
      eat all the time. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. eats and emaciates all of

      is one of the best remedies for headache or periosteal pains generally, from suppressed
      gonorrhœa. I have seen great results from the 200th. It is also a good remedy for syphilitic

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are many remedies that are powerful cathartics, and this is one of
      them. A superficial understanding of our law of cure would lead a novice to conclude that all
      one would have to do for a case of diarrhœa would be to prescribe <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>.
      Of course failure would often be the result. The simple fact of diarrhœa is only a factor in
      the case, where the selection of a remedy for its cure is concerned; for each cathartic has
      not only a diarrhœa, but a peculiar kind of diarrhœa which no other remedy has. The
      diarrhœa of <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> is characterized by:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st. The <i><font color="#0000ff">profuseness</font></i> of the stool. 2d.
      The <i><font color="#0000ff">offensiveness</font></i> of the stool. 3d. The aggravations <i><font color="#0000ff">in the morning</font></i>, <i><font color="#0000ff">hot weather</font></i>,
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">during dentition</font></i>. Then again the concomitants are very
      peculiar. There is often present prolapsus ani, sleep with eyes half closed and rolling the
      head from side to side and moaning; frequent gagging or empty retching. These symptoms present
      have often led to the administration of this great remedy with very gratifying results. In
      regard to the profuse stools, they are so much so that they seem to drain the patient dry at
      every one. They may be yellow or greenish watery, and when watery, always profuse. Then again
      they may be pappy and profuse (<i><font color="#0000ff">Gambogia</font></i>), or mucous and
      scanty, but always with <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> very offensive. I have
      cured these cases in all stages. In the first onset of the disease, as well as in the very far
      advanced and apparently hopeless cases of cholera infantum, the 1000th potency (B. &amp; T.)
      has done the best for me. Notwithstanding the fact that this remedy is one of quite a list set
      down for liver troubles, both with looseness of the bowels and constipation, I have not found
      it very efficacious in the latter. I can readily see how it might be, however, in liver
      troubles with constipation which had followed a preceding diarrhœa, just as <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> might cure the sleeplessness that followed preceding stupor,
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i> sleepiness which followed preceding excitement.
      All drugs have their double action, or what is <i><font color="#0000ff">called</font></i>
      primary and secondary action. But the surest and most lasting curative action of any drug is
      that in which the condition to be cured simulates the primary action of the drug. For, as I
      have held elsewhere, I think that what is called secondary action is really not the legitimate
      action of the <i><font color="#0000ff">drug</font></i>, but the aroused powers of the organism
      <i><font color="#0000ff">against</font></i> the drug. So the alternate diarrhœa and
      constipation in disease is a fight, for instance, between the disease (diarrhœa) and the
      natural powers resisting it. It is of considerable importance then to be able to recognize in
      such a case whether it is the diarrhœa or constipation that is the disease, against which the
      alternate condition is the effort of the vital force to establish health. Yet such an
      understanding is not always absolutely imperative, for in either case there are generally
      enough concomitant symptoms to decide the choice of the remedy. Indeed, the choice must always
      rest upon either the peculiar and characteristic symptoms appearing in the case or the <i><font color="#0000ff">totality</font></i> of them. None but the true homœopathist learns to
      appreciate this. Here is where what is called pathological prescribing often fails, for the <i><font color="#0000ff">choice of the remedy may depend upon symptoms entirely outside of the symptoms
      which go to make up the pathology</font></i> of the case, at least so far as we as yet
      understand pathology.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> has a great desire to press the gums together during
      dentition. When this symptom is prominent, the choice will have to be made between this remedy
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>, both being great remedies for cholera
      infantum. In the nausea of <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> vomiting is not so
      prominent as with <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac</font></i>, but the <i><font color="#0000ff">gagging</font></i>
      without vomiting is very marked, as it is also under <i><font color="#0000ff">Secale cornutum</font></i>.
      Rumbling in the abdomen, especially in the ascending colon, is strong indication for this
      remedy even in chronic bowel troubles. Prolapsus ani is also a prominent symptom of this
      remedy, so also is prolapsus of the uterus, especially after straining, over-lifting or
      parturition. Here the choice will often be between <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum, Rhus
      tox</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> seems also to have a strong affinity for the
      ovaries, and some remarkable cures have been made on the symptom, -"Pain in right ovary,
      running down thigh of that side." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium tig</font></i>.)
      Sometimes there is also numbness attending. Ovarian tumors have disappeared under the action
      of this remedy, when this symptom was present. I once made a brilliant cure of an obstinate
      case of intermittent fever with this remedy. The chills were very violent and were followed by
      intense fever with <i><font color="#0000ff">great loquacity</font></i>. There was also great
      jaundice present. When the fever was past the patient fell asleep, and on awakening did not
      remember what he had said in his loquacious delirium. The range of this remedy does not seem
      very wide, but within its range its action is surprisingly prompt and radical.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy should be considered alongside of <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>
      because it is one of the so-called cathartics. Although one is as decided a cathartic as the

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both are apt to be worse during hot weather.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both are apt to be worse in the morning.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both are often well supplemented with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">But now let us look at some of the more marked and peculiar symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>. Stools yellow, fæcal, bloody or transparent jelly-like
      mucus. Sometimes this jelly-like mucus (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich</font></i>.) comes
      in great masses, or "gobs," and drops out of the rectum almost unnoticed. Again the
      stools are often passed involuntarily when expelling flatus or passing urine. There seems to
      be not only an actual weakness in the sphincter ani, but a distressing <i><font color="#0000ff">sense</font></i> of weakness. The rectum feels as if full of heavy fluid which
      will fall out of escape from the patient, and in fact does so if he doesn't "git there,
      Eli" This escape of stool with flatus in <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i> finds
      its counterpart in <i><font color="#0000ff">Oleander</font></i>. No two remedies are more
      alike in this respect, though <i><font color="#0000ff">Muriatic acid</font></i> is also
      similar. Again a very characteristic symptom in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
      diarrhœa is "Great rumbling in the abdomen just before stool," and the feeling of
      weight in the rectum already mentioned is not always confined to the rectum, but is also felt
      through the whole pelvis and abdomen. Again, the rectum protrudes in <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
      like a bunch of grapes, and is relieved by the application of <i><font color="#0000ff">cold
      water. Muriatic acid</font></i> is relieved by hot applications. Both of these remedies have
      blue hæmorrhoids; the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i> itching intensely, while those
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Muriatic acid</font></i> are very sore and sensitive to touch,
      even of the bed clothes. In addition to the aggravations already mentioned, the diarrhea of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i> is aggravated by walking or standing, after eating or
      drinking.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In dysentery there is violent tenesmus, heat in the rectum, prostration
      even to fainting and profuse clammy sweats. The weakness of the sphincter ani is also found in
      constipation. It is a curious symptom, and I would not believe it until I had seen it with my
      own eyes. "Solid stool passing involuntarily, passing away unnoticed." I was called
      to treat a child five years of age suffering from birth with a most obstinate form of
      constipation. He had to be forced and held to the stool crying and screaming all the while
      being totally unable to pass any fæces even after an enema. After trying several remedies in
      vain, I asked the mother to turn the child over (he was in bed) to let me examine the anus and
      rectum. As she turned down the bed clothes to do so, a large chunk of solid fæces appeared in
      the bed. "There," she said, "that is the way it is. Notwithstanding his
      inability to pass stool when he tries, we often find these things in the bed, and he does not
      know when they pass, nor do we." I then gave a few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
      200th and cured the whole trouble quickly and permanently. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> has also prolapsus uteri, and the feeling
      of heat, heaviness and fullness in the abdomen, pelvis and rectum guides to its selection.
      Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>, also, its range of action is not wide,
      but positive, reliable and satisfactory.</p>

      while <i><font color="#0000ff">Croton tig</font></i>. has washing in the intestines as from
      water. Both of these remedies having aggravation after eating or drinking, we would have to
      look further for the symptoms deciding between them. Another symptom that has frequently been
      verified in this remedy is -"Excruciating pain running from nipple to back (scapula) of
      the same side when the child nurses." I have cured bad cases of mastitis guided by this
      one symptom. <i><font color="#0000ff">Croton tig</font></i>. cures eczema especially of the
      scrotum, where the eruption itches intensely, but is so sensitive and sore to touch that he
      cannot scratch. This comprehends the main uses of this valuable remedy.</p>

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulphuricum</font></i> is also one of our armamentarium for
      diarrhœa, both acute and chronic. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum, Sulphur, Nuphar</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rumex</font></i>, the diarrhea is aggravated in the morning. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> drives the patient out of bed, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      sulph</font></i>., like <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, is worse only after
      beginning to move. Then again <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulph</font></i>. has, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>, much rumbling in the bowels as of flatulence. This rumbling
      of flatus is often with <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulph</font></i>. located in the right
      side of the abdomen in the ileo-cæcal region.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again the <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulphuricum</font></i> stool is,
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">China, Argentum nit., Calcarea phos., Agaricus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>, accompanied by a profuse emission of flatus. This flatulence
      is not always present, but is often so. In chronic diarrhœa there is almost always some
      trouble with the liver, evidenced by soreness in right hypochondrium, which is sensitive to
      touch, and hurts on walking or any jar. One very strong characteristic for this remedy in this
      trouble is aggravation of the diarrhœa, pain, etc., in damp weather. In this it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhododendron</font></i>. The
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i> has the aggravation in change from warm to cold
      weather, weather damp or dry. This aggravation in damp weather is not confined to diarrhœa in
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulph</font></i>. but is especially present in cases of
      chronic asthma. I have seen very great benefit in such cases of this very troublesome and
      obstinate disease, and as aggravation in damp weather very commonly occurs in cases of old
      asthma this remedy is often indicated. I have not observed much benefit from this remedy in
      runarounds, for which it is highly recommended; but have seen nice results from it in very
      obstinate cases of gonorrhœa, when the discharges was thick and greenish and little pain. <i><font color="#0000ff">Loose cough, with soreness and pain through the left chest, is very
      characteristic</font></i>. This is one of the chief diagnostic points of difference between <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulphuricum</font></i>,
      that while with both there is great soreness of the chest with the cough, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> the cough is dry, while with <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      sulph</font></i>. it is loose. The patient springs right up in bed, the cough hurts him so.</p>
      <p align="justify">There is as much soreness as there is with <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>,
      and when the patient coughs he springs up in bed and holds the painful side in his hand to
      ease the hurt. This symptom may be found in chronic affections of the respiratory organs, such
      as asthma, phthisis, etc., and I have several times seen remarkably prompt relief and cure
      follow its administration in pneumonia when this symptom was present. This pain through the
      lower left chest is as characteristic for <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulph</font></i>.,
      as is that of pain running through right lower chest for <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali
      carbonicum</font></i>.</p>
