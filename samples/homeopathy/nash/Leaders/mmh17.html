      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now that we have introduced the <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrums</font></i>,
      we will continue them. Common salt. A gentleman once said to me when I prescribed a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> 30th, "Pshaw, I get more sulphur than that in every
      egg I eat. How can that do me any good?" My answer was, wait and see. And he was cured of
      both doubts and disease. There is no remedy in the Materia Medica, I think, that so disgusts
      the advocates of the low potency, and, low only, as this one. The unquestionable cure of the
      most obstinate cases of intermittent fever with the 200th and higher potencies demoralizes
      them. That people eating salt in appreciable quantities right along and can't live without it,
      don't get well on it, and <i><font color="#0000ff">do</font></i> get well on the same thing
      potentized, does not hold to reason, the microscope, molecular theory; spectrum analysis, or
      anything else scientific (so called) not being able to discover any material in the dose. But
      there stand the cures, like the blind man whom Jesus healed. It is a hard thing to be
      confronted by such facts against our prejudices. "Oh, well," said one of these
      doubters, "people sometimes get well without medicine." so they do with, I replied.
      Isn't it curious how some physicians will hoot at a potency and fly like a frightened crow
      from a bacillus varying in size from 0.004 millimeters to 0.006 m.m. They can hardly eat,
      drink or sleep for fear a little microbe of the fifteenth culture will light on them
      somewhere, but there is nothing in a potency above the 12th. Oh, consistency! When prejudice
      gives way to honest, earnest investigation for truth, the world may be better for it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. is one of our best remedies for anæmia. It does not
      seem to make much difference whether the anæmia is caused by loss of fluids (<i><font color="#0000ff">China, Kali carb</font></i>.), menstrual irregularities (<i><font color="#0000ff">Puls.</font></i>), loss of semen (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phos. acid, China</font></i>),
      grief or other mental diseases. In these cases of anæmia, to which <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i>
      is adapted, we may, in addition to the general paleness, have emaciation, notwithstanding the
      patient eats well. Severe attacks of throbbing headache; shortness of breath, especially on
      going upstairs, or other physical exertion; scanty menstruation; more or less constipation and
      generally great depression of spirits. In fact, depression of spirits is characteristic of
      this drug; the patient weeps much, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, the
      difference being that the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> patient is soothed
      and comforted by consolation, while the <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.
      patient is aggravated.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is almost always in these anæmic cases a great deal of fluttering,
      palpitation, and even intermittent action of the heart. I have helped many such cases with
      this remedy high, in single doses, only repeating when improvement lagged. I have seen a
      patient who had lost 40 pounds of flesh (weight, 160 lbs.), though eating well all of the
      time, under one dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>., tip the scales at 200
      lbs. within three months from the time of taking. He was very hypochondriac at the time of the
      beginning of treatment. I cannot speak too highly of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.
      in these affections. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. is one of our best
      remedies for chronic headaches. They come in paroxysms and would, by their intense throbbing
      nature, cause one to think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>, only that they
      occur mostly in the anæmic, and the face is pale, or at least slightly flushed. If the face
      is red and burning, eyes injected, and pain of beating or throbbing nature, we would
      immediately think of such remedies as <i><font color="#0000ff">Melilotus, Belladonna</font></i>,
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vom</font></i>., and then look for concomitant symptoms to
      decide between them. The headaches of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. are very
      apt to occur after the menstrual period, as if caused by loss of blood, and you know that <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> also has throbbing headache in such cases. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> the throbbing headache occurs whether the menses be scanty
      or profuse. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. also cures the headaches of school
      girls, and here it may be difficult to choose between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea
      phos</font></i>., both remedies also being particularly adapted to anæmic states. Indeed, I
      have sometimes missed and had to give <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phos</font></i>. when <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> failed and vice versa, because I could not make the choice.
      These headaches are often brought on by eye-strain, as in long-continued study, close sewing,
      etc. Then we have asthenopia with the headache, and must study also <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum
      nit</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta graveolens</font></i>. In actual practice
      such cases do sometimes occur, where the case in hand is not far enough developed in
      symptomatic indications to enable one to choose between two about equally indicated remedies.
      If a man hits it well without ever having to try but twice I can forgive him for failing the
      first time, and am willing to be forgiven myself. In these cases, however, let the physician
      be blamed, and not Homœopathy, for that never fails. So-called sick headaches often find
      their simillimum in <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. For want of space we
      cannot give all of the symptoms which might indicate it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.
      acts upon the whole alimentary tract, from mouth to anus, and has very characteristic symptoms
      guiding to its administration. The lips and corners of the mouth are dry, ulcerated, or
      cracked (<i><font color="#0000ff">Condurango</font></i>). In this it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric acid</font></i>, as it also does at the other end of the alimentary
      canal; for with both remedies the anus is fissured, sore, painful and sometimes bleeding. <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crudum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
      are also to be remembered in this connection; but while <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
      has the affection of both mouth and anus, it is more of an eczematous or eruptive character
      than either of the other remedies. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> has great <i><font color="#0000ff">sense</font></i> of dryness in the mouth without actual dryness. Now <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> has thirst with moist mouth, but there is with this remedy
      swollen tongue, or flabby tongue, with indentations or prints of the teeth upon it, and very
      offensive breath, all of which is not markedly so of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.,
      so there is no danger of confounding the two. You will remember that although alike or similar
      in their mind symptoms <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> has the exact opposite
      as regards this symptom, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">dry mouth with no thirst</font></i>,
      furnishing a very marked contrast where a choice is necessary. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i>
      has another similarity to <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, in that it has
      bitter taste, and loss of taste. Again <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> has a
      sensation upon the tongue similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>, viz.,
      sensation of a hair upon the tongue (also <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich</font></i>.).
      Deep painful fissure in middle upper lip is given in Guiding Symptoms, but I have found it in
      the lower lip and believe it to be just as characteristic. I made a splendid cure, being led
      to examination of the remedy by this symptom.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Blisters like pearls around the mouth are found in <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      mur</font></i>., especially in intermittents. If the upper lip is much thickened or swollen,
      not of an erysipelatous character, we would think of three remedies, all of which have it, <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna Calcarea ost., Natrum mur</font></i>. Alone, of course, this
      symptom would not amount to much but is strongly corroborative if found in connection with
      other symptoms of any of these remedies. The symptoms of the gums may be summer up in one
      word, scorbutic. Now study also <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius, Carbo veg., Muriatic acid</font></i>,
      etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another curious symptom in which I was helped by the elder Lippe
      to prescribe <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. with success in a case that had
      baffled me for a long time, viz., numbness and tingling of tongue, lips and nose. This came in
      connection with a chronic soreness of the liver, derangement of digestion, such as is often
      found in a condition which is popularly termed biliousness. This condition <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>., given very high (said Lippe) c. m., clears up the case
      in a very short time. <i><font color="#0000ff">Map tongue</font></i> is found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur., Arsenicum alb., Lachesis, Nitric acid</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Taraxacum</font></i>. I have used <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i>
      with success oftener than the others. I have not found <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>.
      a great throat remedy, except in follicular pharyngitis, which had been abused with local
      applications of Nitrate of Silver. In post-diphtheritic paralysis of the muscles of
      deglutition <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      have served me much better. Salivation profuse, watery and salty, is the reactionary or
      secondary action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> and may find its remedy here.
      but this is not so often found as the other condition of dryness. <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      mur</font></i> has some strong characteristics under the head of appetite, thirst, desires and
      aversions. No remedy is more hungry, yet he loses flesh while eating well. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Acetic acid, Abrotanum, Iodine, Sanicula</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i>). <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i> has this
      canine hunger with emaciation; but after eating the <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i>
      patient feels weary and sleepy, while the <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i> one feels
      better. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> patient after eating feels dull, with
      heavy aching and sense of fullness and discomfort in the region of the stomach and liver,
      which is relieved as digestion advances (see <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>); but
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i> patient wishes to eat all of the time and feels
      comfortable only when the stomach is full or being filled. There are several remedies which
      are either hungry or relieved by eating, notably <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium,
      Chelidonium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i>, as well as <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i>. One
      might add also as hungry remedies <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i> has
      pain in the stomach which extends to the spine, and an <i><font color="#0000ff">all gone</font></i>
      sensation which must be relieved by eating; and after two hours returns and he must eat again.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> hunger is accompanied with the characteristic
      liver symptoms. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>). In <i><font color="#0000ff">China, Natrum mur</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      hunger, patient <i><font color="#0000ff">fills up quickly</font></i> and fullness, flatulence
      and distress follow until the process of digestion is well advanced, when they are relieved.
      Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. is a very useful remedy for an abnormal
      craving for salt. Patient salts everything he eats. A dose of the c. m. corrects this craving
      and often cures other symptoms accompanying. <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      also has this symptom, and if the other symptoms indicate must take the preference. Of course
      the intense thirst of salt is well known, and keep pace with the hunger. Now this is the case
      with diabetes, for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> is a curative if otherwise
      indicated. In all of these cases, of course, it must be used high, for we get the low in our
      food.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Under the head of stool and rectum few remedies have stronger symptoms. I
      quote verbatim from "Guiding Symptoms:" -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Constipation;
      obstinate retention of stool; stools irregular, hard, unsatisfactory; during menses; stools in
      large masses; stools like sheep dung; from inactivity of rectum; anus contracted, or torn,
      bleeding, smarting, or burning afterwards; stitches in the rectum causing hypochondriasis or
      ill humor; great torpor without pain; from want of moisture, dryness of mucous linings, with
      watery secretions in other parts; difficult expulsion, fissuring anus with flow of blood,
      leaving sensation of much soreness; with uterine displacements; hæmorrhoidal; in Addison's
      Disease</font></i>." Now to read this rightly we must entirely separate these symptoms,
      here separated by the semi-colon, and put the word constipation before each one. That saves
      the error of supposing that all the symptoms here quoted must be present in a single case of
      constipation to make <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum muriaticum</font></i> the proper remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One of the best possible exercises for a student of Materia Medica is to
      compare these different symptoms, as follows: Stools dry, crumbling, is also found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium muriaticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia muriatica</font></i>.
      Constipation from inactivity of the rectum, <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina, Veratrum album,
      Silicea</font></i>, etc. Anus contracted, torn, bleeding, smarting and pain after stool, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric acid</font></i>. From want of moisture, dryness of mucous linings, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>. Leaving
      sensation of much soreness, <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia, Nitric acid, Alumen</font></i>.
      Then again <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. may become the only curative for
      cholera infantum, chronic diarrhœa, and other conditions were <i><font color="#0000ff">loose
      stools</font></i> predominate. I will not wait to specify all the symptoms. Emaciation, hunger
      and thirst are present, especially in cholera infantum, emaciation being most noticeable in
      the neck. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Abrotanum</font></i> in the legs, also <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammon. mur</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Argent. nit</font></i>.)
      Emaciation, <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum, Sarsaparilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i>. On the urinary organs I will only call attention to the
      increased secretion already spoken of, and the involuntary escape of urine, which is also
      found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum, Pulsatilla, Zincum</font></i> and others, and
      a burning and cutting in the urethra <i><font color="#0000ff">after</font></i> urination. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sarsaparilla</font></i> has the nearest to this last symptom, and we remember
      here the resemblance of these two remedies as to emaciation in cholera infantum. This cutting
      in the urethra may be found in chronic cases of gleet, and in these cases the discharge is
      almost always, as it is under <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. in all mucous
      membranes, clear and watery. This remedy is one of the best for bearing-down pains in women,
      which are worse in the morning. The patient feels as if she must sit down to prevent
      prolapsus. This is like the pains of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> patient,
      who feels as if she must cross her legs for the same purpose. Now if we had the stool and anal
      symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> present, and especially the
      hypochondriasis, we would have almost a sure thing in <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i>.
      These uterine symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> are often accompanied by
      back pains, which are relieved by lying upon back, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>.
      I have already spoken of the headaches accompanying, and especially following the menses. They
      are throbbing and accompanied by great soreness of the eyes, especially on turning them. I
      have a patient now who has these headaches occasionally. She is inclined to anæmia. Was, when
      young, very anæmic. She is always relieved by this remedy in the 250m. potency, and under it
      is regaining her color and general health.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. has strong action upon the heart and circulation, as
      the following marked symptoms indicate: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Fluttering of the heart
      with weak faint feeling, worse, lying down. Irregular intermission of beats of heart and
      pulse, worse on lying on left side. Violent pulsations of the heart which shake the body</font></i>."
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>). All these symptoms are more markedly present
      in anæmic subjects, with constitution generally weakened by grief, sexual excess, loss of
      blood and other debilitating causes. It is especially efficacious in subjects suffering from
      abuse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>. In fevers it is among Hahnemannians too
      well known to need much space here. In intermittents it is especially useful in cases
      suppressed, not cured, by <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>, and its leading
      characteristic is in the <i><font color="#0000ff">time</font></i> of the appearance of the
      chill.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> appears characteristically at 10 to 11 A. M.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium perfoliatum</font></i> at 7 A. M.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Apis mellifica</font></i> at 3 P. M.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> at 4 P. M.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum alb</font></i>. at 1 to 2 P. M. or A. M.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Without fixing the time just to the hour, there are many remedies which
      have chills in the morning or in the evening, etc. Now in regard to the time of aggravation in
      fevers, they occur quite as characteristically in other than intermittents. For instance the <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> at 10 A. M., the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>
      at 1 P. M. or A. M., etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The fever, headache and all other symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i>
      are <i><font color="#0000ff">relieved by sweating</font></i>, as are those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> also. There are some strong symptoms found in the
      extremities. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Hang nails</font></i>." The <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> subject is always having them. Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">numbness</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">tingling in fingers and toes</font></i>,
      like that also found in the lips and tongue, should make one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i>.
      The ankles are weak and turn easily, especially in children who are late in learning to walk. <i><font color="#0000ff">Painful tension in the bends of the limbs</font></i>, as if the cords were too
      short. This may amount to actual deformity, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum, Guaiacum</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cimex</font></i>. Then the spine very irritable, sensitive to
      touch, yet relieved <i><font color="#0000ff">by hard pressure</font></i>, with weakness of the
      limbs, fluttering of the heart, even half paralyzed extremities. As far as this spinal
      weakness is concerned, it may take on a form of general debility, for which there is no better
      remedy than <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. The mental and physical powers
      seem greatly relaxed, and physical and mental labor equally prostrating. This condition may
      gradually progress to paralysis, and may be the result of badly treated intermittents, sexual
      excesses, diphtheria, depressing emotions or other causes of nervous exhaustion. The action of
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> upon the skin must not be overlooked. First and
      foremost is its eczema, which is raw, inflamed, and <i><font color="#0000ff">especially worse
      at the edges of the hair</font></i>. Next for tetters at the bends of the joints. They crack
      and crust over and ooze an acrid fluid. Finally in urticaria it ranks with <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis, Hepar sulphur</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ost</font></i>.
      I have used more space for this remedy, as I did for <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>, than for most other remedies, for the
      following reasons: First, they are all remedies more efficient in high potencies. Second, they
      are not appreciated by the general profession. Third, I hope to induce those who do not use
      them to investigate them. I have found that those who highly value these three remedies are
      generally good Homœopathic prescribers.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">One of the most frequently corroborated symptoms of this remedy is the
      modality -<i><font color="#0000ff">aggravated by mental exertion</font></i>. The patient is
      unable to think or perform any mental labor without headache (<i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum,
      nit., Sabadilla</font></i>) vertigo or a sense of stupefaction. This symptom alone makes it an
      invaluable remedy, as we often come across that kind of patient. At least I have, and have
      frequently gained great credit by relieving them. I generally use the 30th potency here. Again
      this kind of headache is apt to be worse on exposure to the sun's rays or under gaslight.
      Persons suffering from over-heating from the sun may find relief from <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      carb., Glonoine, Lachesis </font></i>or <i><font color="#0000ff">Lyssin</font></i>. Like the
      other <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrums</font></i>, the carbonate is <i><font color="#0000ff">greatly
      depressed in spirits</font></i>, wholly occupied with sad thoughts. It is one of our best
      remedies for chronic catarrh of the nose, which extends to the posterior nares and throat.
      There is violent hawking and splitting of thick mucus that constantly collects again, (<i><font color="#0000ff">Corallium</font></i>). Although never produced in the proving, clinical use
      has proved it a great remedy for "bearing down" pains. Here the concomitant symptoms
      of mind, sadness, over-sensitiveness to noise, especially music, etc., will confirm its
      choice. Weakness of the ankles from childhood finds a good remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      carb</font></i>. I cured a very bad case in a young man who was very fleshy and walked on the
      inside of his ankles, feet bending outward, from such weakness, his ankles refusing to support
      him, especially when a little over-fatigued. Those are the only uses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum Carb</font></i>. that I know from personal experience or observation.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">The salts of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia</font></i> are not new to
      the medical profession as remedies. Especially is the one under consideration so well known in
      its action upon the intestinal canal that it has for a long time been "my lady's"
      habitual resort for sour stomach and constipated bowels. Of course, then it should become a
      very useful remedy for diarrhœa in the hands of a Homœopathist, and so it is. The kind of
      diarrhœa to which it is most applicable is -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Stools green and
      frothy like the scum of a frog pond</font></i>." All of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesias</font></i>
      are great pain producers, consequently pain relievers, and, as might be expected, the stools
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>. are preceded by <i><font color="#0000ff">griping,
      doubling-up colic</font></i>. So far as colic is concerned, sometimes it might be difficult to
      choose between <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>,
      but the stools are not alike. <i><font color="#0000ff">Rheum</font></i> comes nearest to <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>., in that both have colic before stool, <i><font color="#0000ff">sour stool and sour smell of the whole body</font></i>; but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia</font></i> the <i><font color="#0000ff">green stool</font></i> stands
      first and with <i><font color="#0000ff">Rheum</font></i> the <i><font color="#0000ff">sourness</font></i>.
      The stool of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rheum</font></i> is oftener <i><font color="#0000ff">dark
      brownish</font></i> than green. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> has green stool
      with much pain, but the stool is watery, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>.
      is more slimy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> has the slimy stool which may be
      green also; but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> tenesmus is the leading
      symptom, and the mouth symptoms and sweat without relief under it are not like the other
      remedies. <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>. has toothache which at first
      sight seems to simulate that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>. It comes in
      decayed teeth and is worse at night. There is a finer shade of difference, however, that
      distinguishes them. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> is worse from the <i><font color="#0000ff">warmth of the bed</font></i> (a general characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>), while <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>.
      is worse quiet. The patient is obliged to <i><font color="#0000ff">walk about</font></i> for
      relief. This kind of toothache is common among pregnant women, and I have often cured it. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ratanhia</font></i>.) I have used it in the 200th potency for this trouble.
      Have used it lower in diarrhœas. I once cured a severe case of coccydynia, a case of long
      standing. The pains were sudden, piercing, causing the patient to almost faint away. <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>. 200th cured promptly. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lobelia

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This salt of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia</font></i> seems to act
      differently from the <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>., for while the latter
      most characteristically produces diarrhea, and we find it oftenest useful there, the former
      constipates. It has a peculiar form of constipation. The stools are hard, difficult, slow,
      insufficient, knotty, like sheep's dung, and <i><font color="#0000ff">crumble at the verge of
      the anus</font></i>. Sometimes can only be passed by <i><font color="#0000ff">bearing down
      with the abdominal muscles</font></i>. The remedies most resembling it in this form of
      constipation are <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium
      mur</font></i>. and now that I think of it I might as well mention here another similarity
      between <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium mur</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia
      carb</font></i>. which is characteristic, viz.: The menstrual flow is worse at night. I forgot
      this when writing of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia carb</font></i>. Perhaps it will be all
      the better remembered for this interruption. With the <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia mur</font></i>.
      menstruation is very painful; accompanied with severe cramps, which may increase to general
      spasms of a hysterical nature. This nervous condition, if found coupled with the peculiar
      constipation above described, will be a sure indication for the use of this remedy. Again it
      has a peculiar nervous headache, which is better from strong pressure (<i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>), or wrapping head up warmly (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>).
      This headache also is often hysterical. The spasms in connection with uterine troubles may
      find rival remedies in <i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa racemosa</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Caulophyllum</font></i>, the <i><font color="#0000ff">tout ensemble</font></i>
      must decide. <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia mur</font></i>. is a liver remedy, and in some
      symptoms resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>, notably, the tongue <i><font color="#0000ff">takes imprint of the teeth and the aggravation from lying on the right side</font></i>.
      But the stools of these remedies are characteristically very different. Again, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> is best adapted to acute affections of this organ, <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia mur</font></i> is more so to the chronic. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ptelea</font></i>,
      liver troubles are <i><font color="#0000ff">worse when lying on the left side</font></i>. A
      very peculiar symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia mur</font></i>., often confirmed
      is: Palpitation of the heart when the <i><font color="#0000ff">patient is quiet, relieved</font></i>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now we come to the prince of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesias</font></i>.
      It is comparatively new and has never been accorded a place in our Materia Medica according to
      its importance and merits. Dr. H. C. Allen gives the best rendering of it in the transactions
      of the International Hahnemannian Association for 1889. <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>.
      takes first rank among our very best neuralgia or pain remedies. None has a greater variety of
      pains. They are sharp, cutting piercing, stabbing, knife-like, shooting, stitching,
      lightning-like in coming and going (<i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>),
      intermittent, the paroxysms becoming almost intolerable, often rapidly changing place and <b><font color="#ff0000">cramping</font></b>. This last is in my opinion <i><font color="#0000ff">most
      characteristic</font></i>, and is oftenest found in stomach, abdomen and pelvis. For colic of
      infants it ranks with <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> and for dysmenorrhœa of the neuralgic variety, with the
      characteristic crampy pains, I have found no remedy equal to it. In this last affection I
      habitually prescribe the 55m. made by myself upon the gravity potentizer, so that I know
      exactly what it is. So often are we confronted with the question when we report cures with the
      high potencies, where do we get them, and are you sure they are what they purport to be? Now
      let me say right here, if I have not done so before, that we have potencies as high as the m.
      m., made by ourselves upon this accurately self-registering potentizer, that are marvelous for
      their curing powers. We (Dr. Santee and myself) invented the machine for our own individual
      use and have never yet offered the potencies for sale. So we can hardly be accused of
      mercenary motives in reporting cures, from them. Alongside the characteristic cramping pains
      of this remedy is its characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">modality -relief from hot
      applications</font></i>. No remedy has this more prominently than <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum
      alb</font></i>., but you will notice that among all the various kinds of pain we have
      mentioned as belonging to <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>. the one
      conspicuous for its absence is the one most characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>,
      viz. -<i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> pains. I watched this difference and found
      that if burning pains were relieved by heat, <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> was
      almost sure to relieve, while those pains not burning but also relieved by heat were cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>. I think that this will be found a valuable
      diagnostic between the two remedies. At least I have found it so. During painful menstruation <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>. is quicker in its action than <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla, Caulophyllum, Cimicifuga</font></i>, or any other remedy that I
      know. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Cimicifuga</font></i> seems to me to cover better, cases of
      a rheumatic character or in a rheumatic subject, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>.
      cures those of a purely neuralgic character. The pains cease when the flow begins, for <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>. In facial neuralgia this remedy has made many cures.
      In fact, it seems to be applicable to neuralgic pains anywhere if the proper conditions are
      present. So far as its power to control spasms or convulsions is concerned, I have no
      experience that proves it unless its power over cramping pains is proof. I have no faith in
      the Schuesslerian theory in regard to it. Similia similibus curantur has stood the test with
      other remedies and will with the so-called tissue remedies regardless of theories.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now in regard to the <b><font color="#ff0000">cramping pains</font></b> so
      characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>.; when such a symptom
      stands out so prominently, it is a great <i><font color="#0000ff">leader</font></i>, and
