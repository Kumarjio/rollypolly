      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One of the worst abused, because frequently used, remedies of all schools
      of medicine. I must explain. I said all schools. The true Homœopath does not abuse it, but
      many members of the school calling themselves homœopathic do. A teacher in one of the
      homœopathic colleges defended its use in narcotic doses in many cases to produce sleep and
      relief from pain. I will say just here that any homœopathic physician that feels obliged to
      use <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> or its alkaloid in this way and for this purpose
      does not understand his business and had better study his Materia Medica, and the principles
      of applying it according to Hahnemann, or else go over to the old school where they make no
      pretensions to have any law of cure. In the first place <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
      in narcotic doses does not produce sleep, but stupor, and it only relieves pain by rendering
      the patient unconscious to it. How many cases have been so masked by such treatment, that the
      disease progressed until there was no chance for cure? Pain, fever and all other symptoms are
      the voice of the disease, telling where is the trouble and guiding us to the remedy. The true
      curative often relieves pain even more quickly than <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>,
      and does so by curing the condition upon which it depends. And even in cases where it does not
      so quickly stop the pain, it is often far better to suffer awhile until the curative can get
      in its work. Probably ninety-nine in a hundred of those suffering from the terrible habit of
      morphine eating are first led into it by physicians who prescribe morphine to "relieve
      pain and procure rest and sleep." And when we take into this account the abuse of
      stimulants, under the name of tonics, habitually prescribed by the same class of physicians it
      is no wonder that they are often heard to say, I don't know whether I have done more good or
      harm.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is this very narcosis which presents the leading characteristic
      indication for the Homœopathic use of this drug. No remedy produces such profound stupor, and
      it is expressed in our Materia Medica as follows: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Stupid,
      comatose sleep, with rattling, stertorous breathing</font></i>." In addition to this the
      face is red and bloated, the eyes blood-shot and half open and the skin covered with hot
      sweat. Now this condition, which is nothing more or less than such a fullness of the vessels
      of the brain or head that, from pressure, a paralysis or semi-paralysis of the nerves which
      carry on the act of breathing, keep the lower jaw up (which drops), and close the sweat
      glands, takes place. There are many diseases in which this state of things may appear, such as
      typhoid fever, where the patient becomes totally unconscious and oblivious to all around.
      There is no response to light, touch, noise or anything else, except the indicated remedy,
      which is <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>. So in pneumonia, where <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> has made remarkable cures in Homœopathic hands; while in
      massive, or what they like to call heroic, doses of the old school (given to stop pain and
      procure sleep) it has sent many a poor victim to his long resting place. In many other
      diseases, in fact in any disease where these symptoms are found, we may confidently expect <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> either to cure the case or to so change the condition that
      other remedies will follow it to a perfect cure. Other remedies may vie with it, for instance
      in typhoids, such as <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>.
      These two remedies will often claim attention in typhoid pneumonia. It often requires close
      discrimination to choose between them. Apoplexy often calls for <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>,
      but here as elsewhere the symptoms must decide.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The fact that <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> is capable of
      banishing pain, or, rather, I should say, rendering the organism incapable of sensing pain, is
      one of the chief indications for its use in homœopathic therapeutics. There is not only
      complete absence from pain, but as complete unsusceptibility to general drug action. You know
      that we are told that when the seemingly indicated remedy does not act give <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. Now it may be that <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
      is a better remedy to give, if all there is of the case is that there seems to be no vital
      reaction. Sulphur would be likely to be the best remedy if the lack of reaction were due to
      some psoric taint; but even here all the symptoms must be taken into account. <i><font color="#0000ff">Laurocerasus</font></i> is another remedy to arouse reaction when it seems to
      depend upon excessively low vitality. <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> may succeed
      in psoric obstructions to vital reactions when <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
      fails. There is nothing to be more condemned in homœopathic prescribing than <i><font color="#0000ff">routinism</font></i>. This same paralyzing effect of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
      is seen in the intestines. Their irritability is lost. Peristaltic action is entirely
      suspended. There is no <i><font color="#0000ff">desire</font></i> even for movement. The fæces
      lie there in the convolutions of the intestines, form into hard, black balls, which must be
      removed by enemas or purgatives. Again, the urinary organs come under the same action. The
      urine is retained from paralysis of the fundus of the bladder; can't pass water from blunting
      of the sensitiveness of the walls of the bladder, etc. Or the other extreme, involuntary
      urination or stool from paralysis of the sphincters. Everywhere <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
      is a producer of <i><font color="#0000ff">insensibility</font></i> and partial or complete
      paralysis and, other things being equal, is homœopathically indicated there.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now we find an exactly opposite state of things under <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> to that we have been describing as indicated by the following
      symptoms: "Delirious, eyes wide open, glistening; face red, puffed up." "Vivid
      imagination, exaltation of the mind." "Nervous and irritable, easily
      frightened." "Twitching, trembling of head, arms, hands; jerking of the flexors,
      even convulsions." "Sleeplessness (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cimicifuga, Coffea</font></i>),
      with acuteness of hearing; clock striking and cocks crowing at a great distance keep her
      awake." These are the secondary or reactionary symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>.
      Nature has been pushed like a pendulum, clear to one side of the perpendicular or normal
      condition. Now, nature endeavouring to undo this mischief, like the law of gravity with the
      pendulum, pulls back with such force that the pendulum swings not only to its normal state,
      but clear over to the other extreme, and then if left to herself will continue to oscillate
      back and forth until the normal place is found and natural law again reigns supreme. It must
      be remembered here that the fist class of symptoms are <i><font color="#0000ff">drug action</font></i>,
      the later action nature's efforts against the drug; so that such excitement, irritability and
      spasms never come under the homœopathic action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
      as a remedy unless this state has been preceded by drowsiness stupor and insensibility, etc.
      It cannot be the homœopathic remedy to the case without this, for its perfect similarity is
      not to be found there This is the reason why the homœopath can make his sleepless patient
      sleep a natural sleep with <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> in the little dose, while
      the allopath forces his patient into a stupor (not a sleep) with his big dose. The one is
      curative, the other poisonous.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The nutmeg, though frequently used for its peculiar flavor in common
      cookery, is nevertheless a powerful poison, hence a valuable remedy. The mind and sensorium
      are profoundly affected by it, as shown by the following characteristic symptoms: "Stupor
      and insensibility and unconquerable sleep." Again "Vanishing of thought while
      talking, reading, or writing." Again. "Weakness or loss of memory." Again,
      "Fitful mood, changing from deepest sorrow to frolicsome behavior; now grave, now
      gay." Again, "Absence of mind, cannot think; has to collect his thoughts before he
      can answer simple questions." Many more symptoms appear among the provings that show the
      action of this drug upon the brain. The effect upon the brain, while producing a sleepiness
      and dulness almost equal to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>, is of an
      entirely different character, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> being seemingly
      due to fullness of the blood-vessels and pressure, while that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      moschata</font></i> seems to be a benumbing of the very nerve substance itself. It is
      interesting to notice the sleepiness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium, Nux mos</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i>, and to study these drugs in comparison.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i>
      are often remedies for pneumonia, but the concomitant symptoms are very different. <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vom</font></i>. in typhoid
      fever, but the choice, notwithstanding, this symptom of stupor common to both, is not at all
      difficult. All three of these remedies in bowel complaints of children have this symptom in
      common, but it is not hard to choose between them. Another very characteristic symptom of this
      remedy is <i><font color="#0000ff">excessive dryness of the mouth</font></i>. Mouth so dry
      that the tongue sticks to the roof, yet no thirst. <i><font color="#0000ff">The tongue, lips
      and throat are all dry</font></i>. Of course, there are other remedies having this dryness
      without thirst, such as <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis, Pulsatilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>, but in this respect <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i>
      is the strongest. Then again <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i> is greatly
      troubled with flatulence. The abdomen is enormously distended, especially after meals. Where
      are two remedies which have pain and distress in the stomach <i><font color="#0000ff">immediately</font></i>
      after eating, even when the patient is still at the table. They are <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      mos</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i> the
      pain comes on an hour or two after eating. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux mos</font></i>.,
      everything they eat seems to turn to wind (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carb, Iodine</font></i>),
      and fills the stomach and abdomen so full as to cause pressure upon all of the organs of the
      chest and abdomen. Again there is diarrhœa with this remedy. It is very efficacious in
      cholera infantum, when the above mentioned sensorial symptoms are present. I once had a very
      severe case of typhoid fever of the <i><font color="#0000ff">nervous stupida</font></i>
      variety. On account of the stupidity, the yellow watery diarrhœa, and rumbling and bloating
      of the abdomen, I thought surely <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> must
      help; but it did not. I finally discovered the excessive dryness of the mouth, which had
      escaped my attention before. This completed the picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      moschata</font></i>. Under the action of the 200th potency, the patient rapidly improved unto
      complete recovery. So we must "watch out" when the seemingly indicated remedy does
      not cure, for it may not be <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur, Opium, Laurocerasus</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i> that will have to be given, as we said when
      writing on <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>;
      but we have not, no matter what the "seemings," chosen the homœopathic remedy at
      all, and, as in this case, some symptom may appear that will change the prescription entirely.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now we will notice in detail the mind and sensorium symptoms that we have
      given, by way of comparison. I will add to the comparison made between this remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tart</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium, Apis mellifica</font></i>,
      which has soporous sleep; but it is interrupted by <i><font color="#0000ff">piercing screams</font></i>,
      especially in brain diseases, where the sopor is generally found. None of the other remedies
      have these screams (cri encephalique) so prominently. "Vanishing of thought while
      talking, reading or writing" may find their similar under <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor,
      Cannabis Indica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>. "Loss of
      memory" under many remedies, but notably under <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium,
      Lycopodium, Bryonia alb., Sulphur</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum muriaticum</font></i>.
      The "fitful, changing moods and disposition" is found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite,
      Ignatia, Crocus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i>. "Absence of
      mind," <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium, Kreosote, Lachesis, Natrum mur</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>. I notice that those remedies that are
      oftenest similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i> in its mind and other
      symptoms are often found among the so-called hysteric remedies. And why not? For <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i> is one of our best in this hydra-headed complaint.
      Taking together all of the symptoms we have been over, and adding to them that other one,
      "easy fainting," where can you find a more complete general picture of the average
      hysteric? I will not use more space here for this remedy, but recommend to every careful
      student, and practitioner, who does not already understand it, a careful study of this
      certainly valuable drug. That it has not received the use in practice that it should is due, I
      have no doubt, to the fact that it is used so frequently in foods, that many think it cannot
      be much of a remedy.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is one of the leading so-called anti-scrofulous remedies. Please refer
      to what I said on this subject (scrofula) while writing on <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>.
      This is also one of the remedies which has one of its leading indications, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ost</font></i>., in the constitution of the patient. Complaints of <i><font color="#0000ff">dwarfish children; mind and body weak; don't grow; inclined to glandular
      swellings. The defective growth is both mental and physical. The weakness of the mind may
      amount almost to idiocy or imbecility. Then again it is equally adapted to old age, with
      mental and physical weakness; feeble and tottering; childishness and thoughtless behavior</font></i>.
      It is especially adapted to apoplexy of old people, or a tendency thereto. For loss of memory
      in such subjects it stands equal to <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>. Now we see
      that if all this is true, <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta carb</font></i>. becomes a valuable
      remedy at both ends of life. <i><font color="#0000ff">Marasmus, infantile or senile</font></i>,
      comes equally within its range. In the marasmus of children we may have to choose from among
      other remedies such as <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea, Abrotanum, Natrum muriaticum,
      Sulphur, Calcarea</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i>. Under all these
      remedies we may find emaciation of the rest of the body, while the abdomen is greatly
      enlarged. Again under every one of them, the child may have a voracious appetite; eat enough,
      but grow poor all of the time. <i><font color="#0000ff">It is defective assimilation</font></i>.
      There are some strong points of resemblance between <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta carb</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>, namely: <i><font color="#0000ff">Offensive
      sweat on the feet. The head is disproportionately large for the body. Both suffer from damp
      changes in the weather and both are sensitive to cold about the head</font></i>. But Silicea
      has the important diagnostic difference -<i><font color="#0000ff">profuse sweat on the head</font></i>
      equal to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea ost</font></i>., which <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i> has not. And there is not that weakness of mind in <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> that is found in <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>;
      on the contrary the child is self-willed and contrary.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The resemblances to the other remedies, other than those we have mentioned,
      are so many that we will not undertake to compare them here, but will proceed to notice some
      of the other strong points of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Besides the strong action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i>
      upon the glandular system generally, it seems to have a peculiarly strong affinity for the
      throat, <i><font color="#0000ff">especially the tonsils, which become greatly inflamed,
      swollen and suppurate as a consequence of the least exposure to cold</font></i>. Thus it
      becomes one of our most valuable therapeutic agents in old quinsy subjects. Alone it is often
      sufficient to abort an attack of quinsy and with an occasional dose at long intervals with a
      high potency, to overcome the tendency thereto. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>).
      But like <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis, Lycopodium, Phytolacca</font></i> and other
      remedies, it must be chosen according to all the indications. <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i>
      is really fully as useful to change the constitutional tendencies to quinsy, as it is in the
      acute attack. You will find occasionally a case of <i><font color="#0000ff">chronic cough in
      children with enlarged</font></i> tonsils, reported in the journals as cured by this remedy.
      The cure of the cough depends evidently upon the power of the remedy over the condition which
      produced the enlarged tonsils, for aside from this I have never found it to be a great cough
      remedy. In tonsilitis acute or chronic which seems to have come as the result of a <i><font color="#0000ff">suppressed foot-sweat</font></i>, we would immediately think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i> notwithstanding <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>
      has more troubles arising from such suppression than any other remedy, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> has not nearly the same affinity for the throat that <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i> has.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here we will close <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta</font></i>, for while it
      is a remedy of the greatest value, its range is not a wide one. Some of the remedies of this
      kind make up for the lack of range by a positiveness within their range, and this is one of
      them.</p>

      characteristic indications:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">First: "Scrofulous diathesis; low cachectic condition, with profound
      debility and great emaciation."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Second: "There is a remarkable and unaccountable sense of weakness and

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i> in a nutshell. <i><font color="#0000ff">The remarkable hunger relieved by eating, with progressive emaciation, is the
      first in importance</font></i>. This relief by eating is not only of the sensation of hunger,
      but his sufferings in general; <i><font color="#0000ff">he only feels well while eating</font></i>,
      or always feels best while eating. It makes no difference whether it is phthisis pulmonalis,
      mesenteric, or general, that this symptoms well developed rules out everything but <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i> in almost every case and it has made many remarkable cures.
      I have cured many cases of goître with <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i> c. m., when
      indicated, giving a powder every night for four nights, after the moon fulled and was waning.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have only failed in one case either to check the further development or
      cure. Some will sneer at this, but the <i><font color="#0000ff">cured ones</font></i> do not.

      remembered how almost exactly opposite, so far as temperament is concerned, is <i><font color="#0000ff">Iodine</font></i>, which is also one of our chief anti-scrofulous remedies. In
      glandular affections, three remedies that are not as often thought of as they perhaps should
      be, are <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo animalis, Conium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bromine</font></i>; in all three the glands are <i><font color="#0000ff">stony

      pains are not characteristic, but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo animalis</font></i> they are lancinating, cutting or burning, more like

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is a truly unique remedy that none but the homœopathist knows how to
      use. The old school chagrined at our success with it, and not willing to resort to our small
      doses, have bungled with its alkaloid, doing more harm than good, and at last have come to
      sneer at the idea of children being troubled with worms at all. I have known of several
      instances of the kind and it has become so common in the region where I practice that the
      people often ask me -"Doctor, do you believe in worms? Old school doctors don't. I have
      found several worms that my child has passed, and have come to you to see if you can do
      anything for them." It is of great advantage to us Homœopaths to <i><font color="#0000ff">cure the little patients</font></i>, whether we <i><font color="#0000ff">believe
      in worms</font></i> or not. But <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> is not always the
      remedy for worms. But it is perhaps the oftenest indicated remedy for complaints arising from
      lumbricoides, or children infested with the animal. Another thing I have proven to my entire
      satisfaction, and that is, that it is more efficacious for these cases in the 200th or highest
      potencies than in the alkaloid or lower potencies. Now I say this in order to induce those who
      have lost faith in the remedy to try it high, according to well-known indications as laid down
      in our Materia Medica. So many "lose the good they oft might win by fearing to
      attempt." Let us look at a few of the leading symptoms. The wormy child will be very
      restless nights, "<i><font color="#0000ff">screams out sharply</font></i> in its
      sleep," making one think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>, but other symptoms
      appear which rules <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> out. <i><font color="#0000ff">The
      child is cross</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">ugly</font></i> like <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla, kicks and strikes the nurse, wants to be carried</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>) <i><font color="#0000ff">or rocked, or don't want to be
      touched or looked at</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crud</font></i>.), <i><font color="#0000ff">desires things and then refuses them when offered</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bry</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i>), or,
      unlike <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>, it cries if any one tries to take hold
      of or carry it. Isn't that a perfect picture of the mind of a wormy child? When these symptoms
      appear in a child we may sometimes be at a stand between <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>, but close watching will generally decide.
      For instance, if you watch or inquire of the nurse you will find that it <i><font color="#0000ff">alternates between a red-hot face, glowing with a bright redness of both
      cheeks, and a pale, sickly face, with dark rings or circles around the eyes; or, again, red
      face with great paleness around the mouth and nose</font></i>. This is <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i>. If the face is frequently red and hot on one side and pale
      and cold on the other, it is <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>. Then again, on
      inquiry, or we may observe ourselves, the child is <i><font color="#0000ff">boring</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">picking its nose</font></i> a great deal of the time, <i><font color="#0000ff">grinds its teeth when asleep</font></i>, and jumps and jerks in its sleep, <i><font color="#0000ff">frequently swallowing</font></i> as if something came up into the throat, or
      even <i><font color="#0000ff">choking and coughing</font></i> for the same cause. Such a
      combination is not found under any other remedy. Both <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> have profuse and pale urine, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> urine becomes <i><font color="#0000ff">milky</font></i> after
      standing awhile. <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> has alternating <i><font color="#0000ff">canine hunger and no appetite at all. Cina</font></i> is one of our best
      remedies for whooping cough, also jerking, trembling, twitching and even convulsions; but in
      all these affections I have found it efficacious when the aforementioned <i><font color="#0000ff">worm symptoms</font></i> were present. I once had, at one time, and in one
      family, five cases of typhoid fever, and they were all very sick. There was no mistake about
      the diagnosis, and I speak thus positively, because some think. that a child under the age of
      six years cannot have this disease. This child, five years of age, was the last one of the
      family attacked with the disease, and it persued the same course as the others in its regular
      rise and fall of temperature, bloating of abdomen, diarrhœa and other symptoms common to this
      disease. This being in the earlier years of my practice, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i>
      not being set down in the textbooks as a remedy for typhoid, I selected as well as I could
      from the usual remedies for typhoid. I knew perfectly that she had <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i>
      symptoms all mixed in with those already mentioned, and as the case "got no better
      fast," I resolved to give a few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cina</font></i> anyway,
      and to my surprise I found my patient much better every way at my next visit and the
      improvement progressed right along to complete recovery. I had to learn several such lessons
      as that was in my "kittenhood" of homœopathic practice before I learned for good,
      that, for purposes of prescribing, the <i><font color="#0000ff">name</font></i> of the disease
      was of little account. Since I settled that question, I have had frequent opportunities to
      help my younger brethren out of difficulties along the same line, and they have been as much
      astonished as I was.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="justify">This remedy, like many others, finds its chief characteristic in its
      modality. "Complaints caused or aggravated by <i><font color="#0000ff">change of weather
      from warm to cold</font></i>." Of course all kinds of inflammatory and rheumatic diseases
      may spring from such a cause and so <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i> comes to be
      indicated in a long list of them. For instance: <i><font color="#0000ff">After taking cold the
      neck gets stiff, back painful, and limbs lame, or the throat gets sore and quinsy results,
      with stiff tongue and jaws; the tongue may even become paralyzed</font></i>. We see here a
      resemblance to <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta carb</font></i>., and indeed the two remedies
      complement each other nicely. If we had present in a sore throat the above mentioned stiffness
      and lameness, <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i> would be preferred. This cold in
      throat may travel downward and invade the bronchi and lungs, and cough and bloody
      expectoration result. It is especially apt to occur in children or old people this way, and
      then there is apt to be much mucous secretion, hard to raise, with threatened paralysis of the
      vagi. Here it again resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Baryta carb</font></i>. It also
      resembles it in the tendency to get these colds. Asthma humidum, loose cough and rattling of
      mucus is another affection, and the choice here may lie between <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulphuricum</font></i>, which is another <i><font color="#0000ff">wet cold weather</font></i> remedy. Colic and diarrhœa, from cold exposure,
      are often quickly relieved by <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i>, especially if
      taking place in hot weather, when the days or nights become suddenly cold; also dysentery. Let
      me repeat that it is a great remedy for <i><font color="#0000ff">back troubles</font></i> from
      taking cold. I have made particular mention of these affections because such marked relief has
      followed its administration; but we need not by any means stop here. The bladder, skin or any
      other part of the body comes in for the beneficial action of this remedy, when we have present
      its characteristic modality. <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i> is for affections
      from <i><font color="#0000ff">damp cold</font></i>, what <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
      is for the same from <i><font color="#0000ff">dry cold</font></i>.</p>
