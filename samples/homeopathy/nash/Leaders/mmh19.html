      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Will naturally come in for notice while we are upon <i><font color="#0000ff">weather</font></i> remedies. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara</font></i>,
      its strongest characteristic is in its modality, "<i><font color="#0000ff">aggravation in
      wet stormy weather</font></i>;" but <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhododendron</font></i> is
      particularly worse <i><font color="#0000ff">before</font></i> the storm, especially a thunder
      storm; after the storm breaks the patient feels better. The aggravation before the thunder
      storm does not at all seem to depend on the coldness or dampness, but partially at least on
      the electric conditions of the atmosphere. This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus,
      Natrum carb</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhododendron</font></i> resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicod</font></i>.
      in that it is worse during rest and better during motion. Again, the pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhododendron</font></i>, which are aggravated in damp weather, differ from
      those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicod</font></i>. in that they seem to be deeper
      seated and are felt in the periosteum, as in the teeth, and in the bones of the forearm and
      tibia. These pains are not, however, <i><font color="#0000ff">confined</font></i> to
      periosteal membranes, but attack also muscles and ligaments, so as to make it difficult to
      choose between these remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So we have quite a list of marked wet weather remedies in <i><font color="#0000ff">Dulcamara, Natrum sulphuricum, Rhododendron, Rhus toxicodendron</font></i> and
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea
      phosphorica</font></i>, wet cold, especially melting snow).</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Rhododendron</font></i> seems to have an especial affinity for the
      testicles. They are swollen, with drawing contusive pains, which sometimes extend to abdomen
      and thighs, and they are very sensitive to touch. The remedies most like it are <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum metall., Clematis erecta, Pulsatilla, Argentum metall</font></i>., and <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i>. If the affection was of syphilitic origin we would prefer <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i>, especially if the case had been abused by old school
      mercurialization. If it came from suppressed gonorrhœa, <i><font color="#0000ff">Clematis</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>; if of rheumatic origin, <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhododendron</font></i>. Of course all the case would come into the
      calculation when making up the perfect picture.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="RUTA"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">RUTA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy which has already been mentioned as to its prominent action in
      the periosteum, especially in injuries and effects therefrom, also, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, has a "<i><font color="#0000ff">bruised</font></i>,
      lame sensation all over as after a fall; worse in limbs and joints," and also "all
      parts of the body upon which he lies are painful, as if bruised." Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>., the <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i> patient
      wants to change position frequently. The pains and lameness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i>
      seem to have a particular liking for the <i><font color="#0000ff">wrists</font></i>. Here also
      must <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupat. perf</font></i>. be remembered.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These pains in the wrists of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i> are,
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicod</font></i>., &lt; in cold, wet weather, and &gt; on
      motion. There is no remedy oftener useful for <i><font color="#0000ff">eye-strain</font></i>
      from close study, sewing, etc., than <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i>. The <i><font color="#0000ff">eyes feel weary and ache as if strained</font></i>, or they burn like balls of
      fire. Two other remedies must be remembered for eye-strain, viz.: <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      muriaticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Senega</font></i>. An understanding of
      these three remedies may save many cases of asthenopia or weakness of accommodation from the
      abuse of spectacles. Ruta is also one of our best remedies for <b><font color="#ff0000">prolapsus
      of the rectum</font></b>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> stands closest here. Both are &lt; on stooping, lifting,
      or at stool. <i><font color="#0000ff">Muriatic acid</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>
      should also be <i><font color="#0000ff">remembered</font></i>; with the former the prolapsed
      organ is very <i><font color="#0000ff">sore and sensitive</font></i> to the least touch, even
      of the sheet on which he lies, and the rectum comes down even when urinating (<i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>). The prolapse of <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>
      is almost always accompanied by the characteristic diarrhea, but may be the result of strain
      by lifting, when the uterus may also prolapse. These uses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i>
      make it a very valuable remedy.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Ledum is a very valuable remedy for rheumatism. This complaint is
      confessedly a very difficult disease to cure by old school treatment. Seldom is a case of the
      inflammatory form completely cured by them. The great majority of their cases run from the
      acute into the chronic form, and last for life. They are often drawn all out of shape (their
      patients), or left with incurable valvular heart trouble. This is not the case under
      homœopathic treatment. On the contrary the patients treated homœopathically are generally <i><font color="#0000ff">cured</font></i>, and very seldom left with any heart trouble, even if the
      disease commenced there, as it sometimes does. Oftener, of course, it begins in the back,
      extremities or joints generally, and then if treated allopathically with local applications it
      is <i><font color="#0000ff">driven</font></i> to the heart, which cannot be reached with local
      applications, hence stays there until exudations occur and hardened deposits from upon the
      valves. Any homœopathic physician guilty of treating a case this way, with such results,
      ought to lose his practice and his diploma.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I do not say this inadvisedly, for I have lived and practiced for thirty
      years past in a decidedly rheumatic district and know whereof I affirm. When we homœopaths of
      the East condemn those of the West for the Quinine (in material doses) treatment of
      intermittents, we are reminded that we do not live in miasmatic districts so we are not
      authority and we can only reply that we know many physicians who do live there who cure their
      patients without the abuse of Quinine. But in this verdict of mine on rheumatism I cannot be
      turned off that way. Rheumatism is one of those diseases that presents plenty of symptoms and
      modalities to guide to the choice from a long list of remedies of the <i><font color="#0000ff">one
      appropriate</font></i> to the case in hand. There is such a great difference in the results of
      applying the remedy according to symptomatic indications, and those arising from simply
      pathological prescribing, that one does not need long to experiment to be convinced. Indeed
      the pathological condition in this complaint does not figure largely in the account, for
      purposes of prescribing. But sensations and modalities do.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> rheumatism begins in the feet
      and travels upward. This is the opposite of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>, which
      goes the other way. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> may be indicated in both acute
      and chronic forms of this complaint. In the acute form the joints are swollen and hot, but not
      red. The swellings are pale and the pains are <i><font color="#0000ff">worse at night</font></i>
      and from the <i><font color="#0000ff">heat of the bed</font></i>, wants them uncovered. This
      is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>, but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>
      the profuse <i><font color="#0000ff">sweat without relief</font></i>, and especially the
      characteristic mouth and tongue symptoms will decide. I have seen wonderful benefit from <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> in such cases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In the chronic form of the disease this remedy is equally efficacious. Here
      also we have the joints swollen and painful, especially in the heat of the bed, and painful,
      hard nodes and concretions form in the joints of feet first, then hands. The periosteum of the
      phalanges is painful on pressure. The ankles are swollen and the soles are painful and
      sensitive, can hardly step on them. This painful and sensitive soles of feet is also found
      under <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium crud., Lycopodium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>, and I have relieved it, other symptoms agreeing, with each
      and every one of these remedies. In these case of rheumatic troubles the <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> patient is unnaturally cold. "Lacks vital or animal
      heat," in this, again, resembling <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>; but
      although the <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i> patient has chronic rheumatism of the
      feet, ankles and soles similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i>, aggravated also
      at night, the warmth of the <i><font color="#0000ff">bed</font></i> does <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> aggravate, but on the contrary he wants to be covered warmly.
      Under <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> the relief from cold is so prominent that
      sometimes the only amelioration is from putting the feet into cold water. It is well to think
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> in all cases of rheumatism of the feet and <i><font color="#0000ff">study it up</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We must not leave this remedy without calling attention to its virtues as a
      remedy for injuries. We are apt to think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> first,
      for bruises and the results therefrom, and, on account of its well deserved reputation, to
      forget that there are sometimes other remedies equally valuable. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i>
      sometimes comes in to finish up a work that <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> began
      well, but could not complete, even when <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica was</font></i> best at
      first, for it often removes the ecchymosis and discoloration more rapidly and perfectly. For
      black and blue spots from blows or bruises there is no better remedy than <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Then, again, we have <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i>,
      which is very useful in ecchymosis from the same cause, especially if occurring in cachectic
      or weakened constitutions, with tendency to purpura, or breaking down of the blood. This
      pathological condition would be attended with the characteristic symptoms of the drug. We
      often have ecchymosis into the conjunctiva or sclerotica, for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i> is specific, but for "black eye" from a blow of the fist no remedy
      equals <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> in the 2c potency. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i>
      is a good remedy for punctured wounds, such as the sticking of a nail into the foot, or an awl
      into the hand, etc.; also for stings of insects, especially mosquitoes, but this also needs
      modification. It makes some difference what kind of tissue is wounded by this kind of wound If
      a nerve, for instance, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hypericum</font></i> would be preferable; if
      the periosteum, Ru<i><font color="#0000ff">t</font></i>a; if the bone, <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phos</font></i>., or <i><font color="#0000ff">Symphytum</font></i> to
      promote re-union or repair. We must not forget to mention in connection with what has been
      said of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ledum</font></i> in injuries of the eye that if there is
      great pain in the eyeball itself from the blow, <i><font color="#0000ff">Symphytum</font></i>
      may have to be used. For all these affections I believe the 200th potency better than the
      lower preparations.</p>

      genuine cholera infantum, where the disease is sudden in its onset, and rapid it its course.
      Such cases die in a night or even a few hours, unless <i><font color="#0000ff">Bismuth,
      Veratrum, Kreosote</font></i> or some remedy of such rapid action saves them. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Bismuth</font></i> the stools are <i><font color="#0000ff">watery, profuse</font></i>,
      painless and very offensive; cadaverous smelling. There is also vomiting of large quantities
      and the <i><font color="#0000ff">intense thirst</font></i> is accompanied with vomiting of the
      water drunk the <b><font color="#ff0000">moment</font></b> it touches the stomach. Water <i><font color="#0000ff">only</font></i> is so vomited. Food is retained a little longer (with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>, both water and food are vomited). There is prostration
      equal to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum
      album</font></i>, but the surface is warm and often covered with warm sweat. The face is
      deathly pale, with rings around the eyes. This is a perfect picture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bismuth</font></i>, and no other remedy need be confounded with it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bismuth</font></i> is a remedy for purely
      nervous gastralgia The pain is of a pressing nature, sometimes pressing between the shoulders
      and sometimes there is much burning in the stomach (<i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>).
      It is also often of benefit in cancer of the stomach, when there is at times vomiting of
      enormous quantities of food that seems to have lain in the stomach for days. In such cases
      there is much burning and pain. It has a restlessness and anguish, similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenic</font></i>, wants to move around, can't stay long in one place. In the
      neuralgic form of gastralgia the lower triturations have served me best, but in cholera
      infantum I never use lower than the 200th and have seen remarkable results. Solitude is
      unbearable, child wants mother to hold its hand for company (<i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>).</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This curious substance seems to act chiefly upon the mucous membranes,
      producing profuse and offensive secretions and ulcerations, with greatly depressed vitality.
      This is especially true of the genital organs of the female. Leucorrhœa is putrid, acrid,
      corrosive, staining the linen yellow. The parts with which the discharge comes in contact itch
      and burn, while scratching does not relieve but inflames the parts. This remedy has a <b><font color="#ff0000">tendency to hæmorrhages</font></b>, which are often very obstinate. The
      hæmorrhages occur with leucorrhœal trouble; they are intermittent, will almost stop, then
      freshen up again and again. This is often the case with the lochia after confinement, when the
      choice may lie between these three remedies, <i><font color="#0000ff">Kreosote, Rhus tox</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. The other symptoms must decide between them.
      This ulceration may be found in cancer of the uterus, and then <i><font color="#0000ff">Kreosote</font></i>
      will often be of great value. I have no doubt that many cases which degenerate into cancer
      might be prevented by its timely use. In some cases there is awful burning in the pelvis, as
      of red-hot coals, with discharge of clots in foul smelling blood. I see that Guernsey
      recommends it in cancer of the mammæ, saying it is hard, bluish-red and covered with scurvy
      protuberances. I have never so used it, but in corrosive leucorrhœas and ulcerations I have
      with great satisfaction. I generally used it in the 200th, with simply tepid water injections
      for cleanliness.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is perhaps no remedy that has a more decided action upon the gums
      (not even <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>) than this one. It is not used often
      enough in painful dentition. The gums are <i><font color="#0000ff">very painful</font></i>,
      swell, look dark-red or blue, and the teeth <i><font color="#0000ff">decay almost as soon as
      they are born</font></i>. A child that has a mouth full of decayed teeth, with spongy, painful
      gums, will find its best friend in <i><font color="#0000ff">Kreosote</font></i>. Cholera
      infantum in such children is of common occurrence, and is of a very severe type, for the
      vomiting is incessant and the stools cadaverous smelling. Never forget <i><font color="#0000ff">Kreosote</font></i> in cholera infantum, which seems to arise from painful
      dentition. or in connection with it, for I have seen some of the finest effects ever witnessed
      from any remedy from this one.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have used it here also in the 200th. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kreosote</font></i>
      is also one of our best remedies in other kinds of vomiting; in the vomiting of pregnancy and
      in that other intractable disease of the stomach, known as gastromalacia. I do not know any
      characteristic indication for it here; but should I find the troubles before mentioned, in
      part or whole such as corrosive leucorrhœa, or the hæmorrhages, or a general hæmorrhagic
      tendency, <i><font color="#0000ff">small wounds inclined to bleed profusely</font></i> (like <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>), I

      <p align="JUSTIFY">At one time I would not have admitted this substance into my list of
      remedies, for I thought it a disgrace to try to foist dog's milk upon the profession as a homœopathic
      remedy. But after accumulated evidence in its favor, and the rule that I had adopted early in
      my professional life, "to prove all things and hold fast that which was good." I
      concluded to try it, and my first trial was in a case of inflammatory rheumatism which had
      withstood my best efforts to relieve for two weeks.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The pain travelled from joint to joint, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      utterly failed. I noticed, after awhile, that it not only travelled from joint to joint, but
      crosswise; one day in the right knee, the next day or two in the left, and then back again,
      etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lac caninum</font></i> cured the case very quickly. Not long
      after I had a very severe case of scarlatina. The throat was swollen full, and the
      restlessness was so marked with pains in the limbs which left the patient tossing from side to
      side that I thought surely <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. must be the remedy.
      But it failed to relieve. Then I discovered that the soreness of the throat and the pains
      alternated sides. This called my mind to the remedy, which was given with prompt relief. I
      used the c. m. in both these cases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Two cases of tonsillitis in one house in separate families. I was called to
      treat one of them, and a very excellent Allopathic physician the other. Of course there was
      close watching to see which case would get well the quickest, and especially if either could
      be cured without suppuration taking place. They were both very bad cases. Both progressed
      rapidly for forty-eight hours. In my case the swelling began on one side; the next day was
      even worse on the other side, so I told them that as the first side was better I thought the
      last one would be better tomorrow; but alas the next day number one was worse again, the
      patient could not swallow, food and drinks came back by the nose. It was with much difficulty,
      chocking and struggling that even a spoonful of medicine could be taken. I hesitated no
      longer, but gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Lac caninum</font></i> c. m. at noon, and when I
      visited her in the evening found her taking oyster broth and she could speak distinctly,
      whereas she could not articulate a word in the morning. In another day the patient was well
      except some weakness. The other case went on the suppuration and was over a week longer in
      getting around. So another victory was scored for Homœopathy, and I have continued to verify
      this characteristic of erratic pains, alternating sides, until I consider it as reliable as
      the keynote of any other remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The curative power of this remedy being settled in my mind, I determined to
      test it by a proving. I induced three clerks in a dry goods store to take pills (No. 35) of
      the 200th (B. &amp; T.), once in two hours. They would not consent to do it until I told them
      what they were to take, and one of them, a well-read young man, remarked with a laugh that if
      wolf's milk would not kill Romulus and Remus it would not them. The result was that within
      three days they had sore throats, and the young man mentioned had on both tonsils distinct
      patches as large as a thumb nail. The other young man was frightened and would not continue
      the proving, and the young lady's sore throat was followed by a severe cough with soreness of
      the chest for over a week.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have found <i><font color="#0000ff">Lac caninum</font></i>; a very useful
      remedy in mastitis, the chief indication being great tenderness and soreness which cannot bear
      the least jar of the bed or stepping on the floor. Again, if the breasts and throat get sore
      during menstruation, especially if the menses flow in gushes instead of continuously, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lac caninum</font></i> is the remedy.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">When writing upon the Kalis I left this one out. There is no proving
      (deserving the name) of this drug, but like some other remedies in our Materia Medica clinical
      use on the theory of Schuessler has developed some valuate guides to its homœopathic uses. It
      resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> in a number of its symptoms, and
      being a deeper acting remedy is sometime useful to complement that remedy. But first let us
      note the similarities:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st. Yellow or greenish discharges from mucous membranes.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">These are all very similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>,
      and I have frequently verified them, in cases of catarrh of mucous membranes, whether acute or

      <p align="JUSTIFY">I once <i><font color="#0000ff">produced</font></i> rheumatism of the

      use it in the 30th, and I think that any after-cured symptom from a potency as high as the
      30th will be found in accordance with our law of similia when thorough proving of the drug is
      made.</p>

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium orientale</font></i> is a very valuable remedy, but is not, I
      think, generally appreciated by our school. It ought often to be used in that hydraheaded
      complaint called dyspepsia, for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is so
      indiscriminately used. Both are excellent remedies, and it is only necessary to know the
      difference to make the choice between them easy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>
      has a pain in the stomach, which comes on <i><font color="#0000ff">only</font></i> when the
      stomach is empty and is <i><font color="#0000ff">relieved by eating</font></i>, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is relieved after the process of digestion is over. The
      pain of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is worst two or three hours after
      meals, but lasts only until digestion is accomplished, and then comes relief, whereas, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>, this is the time when the <i><font color="#0000ff">suffering</font></i>
      is worst. I have cured many cases (some of them of quite long standing) of this description
      with <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>, and find almost as many of them as I do <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> cases. I have found the 200th here more efficacious than
      the lower potencies. The potency here as well as elsewhere and with all remedies has more to
      do with success in curing than some imagine.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Case</font></i>. In the fall of 1899 I was called to a lady, married, 35
      years of age, mother of three children.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">She was quite emaciated, with a yellowish cachectic look of the face. A
      couple of years before I treated her when she had an attack of vomiting, in which she vomited
      coffee-ground substances.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">She was relieved at that time by a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum
      alb</font></i>., 40m., but had more or less trouble with her digestion up to this time. This
      last attack was more persistent and did not yield to <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
      and some other remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">After awhile it appeared that the <i><font color="#0000ff">pain</font></i>
      (which was very severe) <i><font color="#0000ff">and vomiting came on when the stomach was
      empty</font></i>. She had to eat once or twice in the night for relief. The substance vomited
      was always black or brown looking like coffee grounds. Her sister had been operated for cancer
      of the breast, and of course she was very nervous and fearful of cancer of the stomach. <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i> relieved promptly, and she has had no return of the
      trouble since then. Whether the cure is complete remains to be seen, but the benefit from the
      remedy was unquestionable.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both these remedies have frequent ineffectual urging to stool, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is the result of irregular peristaltic action as
      observed by Carroll Dunham, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i> has an
      insufficiency or paralytic state of the rectum which does not appear under <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>. In other words, <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>
      has desire, but with irregular or over-action. <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>
      has the desire, but with not sufficient action to carry it out. Then Anaca<i><font color="#0000ff">r</font></i>dium has a sense of a lump or plug in the anus which ought to come
      away, which does not appear under <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i> is also one of our leading remedies for <i><font color="#0000ff">loss of memory</font></i>, especially in old people of broken down
      constitutions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course, if the characteristic stomach or bowel symptoms were present, or
      had been suffered from, during former years as a concomitant, or the exciting cause of the
      mental trouble, the indication would be strengthened.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are many remedies having <b><font color="#ff0000">loss of memory</font></b>
      as a leading symptom, but none stronger than this one. Of course, the <i><font color="#0000ff">whole
      case</font></i> must be taken into the account. This remedy has two other peculiar mind
      symptoms. First: "Irresistible desire to curse and swear." This symptom, queer as it
      may seem, is no more so than the other symptom found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>,
      and often verified, "patient wants to <b><font color="#ff0000">pray</font></b>
      continually." Some of the most remarkable and convincing cures have been made on just
      such symptoms. Another symptom is, "<i><font color="#0000ff">the patient feels as if he
      had two wills</font></i>," each commanding or moving him to do opposite things, or one
      commanding him to do a thing and the other commanding him not to do it. Such symptoms are
      often found in dementia, and are valuable guides to the curative remedy. See my case reported
      under <i><font color="#0000ff">Platina</font></i>. Then, again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>
      has two other peculiar symptoms. One as of a <i><font color="#0000ff">hoop</font></i> around
      parts, and the other as of a <i><font color="#0000ff">plug</font></i> in inner parts. This may
      be found in head, chest, abdomen or anus. The sensation of a hoop around parts may be found in
      spinal troubles and <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i> will be the remedy. Other
      remedies have a general characteristic sensation, as <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>
      has the sensation of a <b><font color="#ff0000">plug</font></b>; for instance, the feeling of
      fullness as if too full of blood of <i><font color="#0000ff">Æsculus hippocastanum</font></i>.
      and the sensation of constriction of <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus grandiflorus. Anacardium</font></i>
      is also said to be a good antidote for <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> poisoning. I
      have never used it for this.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The chief characteristic leading to the use or this remedy is found in its
      peculiar constipation. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Inactivity of the rectum, even the soft
      stool requires great straining</font></i>." Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>,
      there is no desire for stool and the constipation seems to depend upon dryness of the mucous
      follicles. Again it is adapted to dry, spare subjects. There are other points of resemblance
      between these two remedies and they complement each other well. There are both excellent in
      infantile constipation, which is often a very obstinate affection to treat. <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium, Sepia, Silicea</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum
      album</font></i> are nearest of kin in this lack of expulsive power in the rectum.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> is one of our remedies in chlorotic conditions. The
      patient is pale, weak, tired, must sit down to rest. The menses are scanty, delayed, and are
      pale colored when they come, and after the menses the patient is exhausted and pale. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo an</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>.) Then,
      again, there <i><font color="#0000ff">is profuse leucorrhœa sometimes running down to the
      heels if she does not wear a cloth</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Syphilinum</font></i>.)
      It is as profuse as the menses ought to be. These anæmic patients are often hungry for <i><font color="#0000ff">starch, chalk, rags, charcoal, cloves and other ridiculous and unnatural
      things</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> is a great remedy in such
      cases. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum mur</font></i>. chlorotic couldn't eat bread, or
      had an aversion to it. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> patient <i><font color="#0000ff">can't eat potatoes</font></i>; they disagree. <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      can't eat <i><font color="#0000ff">fat food</font></i>, pastries, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> in
      chronic nasal catarrhs, and both are of tearful temperament, but the constitutions are
      different. <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> being dry and thin, <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> phlegmatic. One thing I forgot to mention under stool
      and rectum, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> is one of the best remedies for
      hæmorrhages of the bowels in typhoid fever. The blood comes in <i><font color="#0000ff">large
      clots looking solid like liver</font></i>. This remedy is also very efficacious in chronic
      sore throats, like clergyman's sore throat. There is "soreness, rawness, hoarseness and
      dryness." This dryness excites a continual disposition to hawk, and after a long time the
      patient raises a little thick, tough phlegm. This kind of throat is temporarily relieved by <i><font color="#0000ff">warm food and drinks</font></i>. The remedy nearest to this is <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum</font></i>, but in <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum</font></i>
      there are <i><font color="#0000ff">wart-like excrescences or granulations in the throat</font></i>.
      Both remedies have a sensation of a splinter in the throat, as do also <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphuricum, Dolichos</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric
      acid</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="justify"><i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> has also a sensation of constriction in the throat and
      œsophagus. It hurts to swallow. <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumina</font></i> is recommended
      for the following symptoms, which often appear in locomotor ataxia: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Great heaviness in the lower limbs; can scarcely drag them; while walking
      staggers and has to sit down</font></i>; in the evening." "Inability to walk except
      with the eyes open and in the day time." <i><font color="#0000ff">Numbness</font></i> of
      the heel when stepping." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Excessively faint and tired, must
      sit down</font></i>." "Pain in the back as if a hot iron were thrust through the
      vertebræ." I give these on the authority of others, for I have never verified them. I
      will add here the value of <i><font color="#0000ff">Alumen</font></i>.</p>
