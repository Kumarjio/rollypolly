      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy, although never anywhere fully proven, has come to be a very
      useful one. In acute catarrh it is one of the best.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Its characteristic symptom here is <i><font color="#0000ff">heavy pain and
      pressure in the forehead and root of the nose</font></i>. This is in the beginning of a cold;
      when the nose begins to discharge freely the pain ceases or becomes much less. It is also a
      great value in the form of nasal catarrh, if when the discharges dry up there is this same
      pain in forehead and frontal sinuses. In these cases the nasal secretions incline to dry up
      and are hard to discharge, but the irritation is so great that there is a constant inclination
      to blow the nose, with little result. These secretions become so hard and dry as to form
      scabby concretions. This condition is next door to the plugs and clinkers of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>, which often go on to ulceration of the septum. I
      have relieved many cases of chronic catarrh with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i>;
      some of years' standing.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">You will remember that <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>
      also has a severe frontal headache at the root of the nose, especially from suppressed
      catarrh, so that all the other symptoms must be considered in choosing between them. The other
      remedies that resemble <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i> in the acute form of catarrh
      are <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Ammonium carb., Camphor, Nux vomica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sambucus</font></i>, and in the chronic form <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium
      carb</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is never with <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i> the watery
      or fluent form of coryza, such as calls for <i><font color="#0000ff">Euphrasia, Mercurius,
      Arsenicum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroiodicum</font></i>. Nor have I
      ever found it of use in the thick, bland kind of discharge that calls for <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla, Sepia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali sulphuricum.
      Sticta</font></i> is also one of our cough remedies and one of the best indications for its
      use, especially in acute cough, is the aforementioned nasal catarrh attending it. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i> cough is also worse at night when lying down and keeps the
      patient awake, though I do not think the wakefulness is entirely owing to the cough, but that
      a nervous condition which also comes under the curative range of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i>
      contributes to it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is one of the best for the obstinacy of cough attending or
      following measles, and here we remember that sleeplessness is a frequent concomitant. In this
      respect <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i> is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea
      cruda</font></i>, which is wonderfully efficacious here. The cough of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i>
      is at fist dry, but later on may become loose; hence it is often found of use in the
      incessant, racking, wearing coughs of consumptives. In hay fever it is the remedy when the
      trouble centres in the head and frontal sinuses; the nose is completely <i><font color="#0000ff">plugged</font></i> up, though there is continual sneezing.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have found <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i> promptly curative
      in inflammatory rheumatism of the knee joint. It is very sudden in its attacks and unless
      promptly relieved by <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i> will go on to the exudative
      stage and become chronic in character. In one case the pain was so severe that the patient,
      though a strong, resolute man, became delirious with the pain. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i>
      relieved and completely cured him, so that he was able to attend to his business (teamster)
      within a week. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta</font></i> deserves a thorough proving. There
      is a nervous symptom that has been several times verified, viz. -"legs felt as if
      floating in the air, or <i><font color="#0000ff">she</font></i> felt light and airy as if not
      resting on the bed." See <i><font color="#0000ff">Asarum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Valerian</font></i>. Such sensations are often found in hysterical conditions
      and are very distressing.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are three localities in which this remedy acts very markedly, viz.:
      Respiratory organs, bowels and skin. "Violent, incessant cough, dry and fatiguing, with
      very little or no expectoration, aggravated by pressure, talking, and especially by <i><font color="#0000ff">inspiring cold air</font></i>, and at night" (Dunham.) There is perhaps
      no remedy under which the sensibility of the mucous membranes of the larynx and trachea become
      more exalted than this one. The patient must cover up the head in bed in order to protect
      these membranes from contact with the air, which immediately excites cough. Several other
      remedies, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i>,
      have cough aggravated by breathing cold air, but none so markedly as <i><font color="#0000ff">Rumex</font></i>.
      Going from warm room into cool air and vice versa. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum carbonicum</font></i> have the opposite. The tickling that
      excites the cough may locate in the throat-pit, supra-sternal fossa, or down behind the
      sternum to stomach, where is often added a sensation of soreness or rawness. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Caust</font></i>.). Again we have found it efficacious in cough, with
      stitching pain <i><font color="#0000ff">through left lung just below left nipple</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum sulph</font></i>.).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The diarrhœa of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rumex</font></i> is similar to
      that of Natrum sulph., Sulphur and <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>, in that it
      occurs in the morning, but it is a <i><font color="#0000ff">brown</font></i> diarrhœa and is
      apt to be accompanied with, or an accompaniment of, the cough. On the skin it cures an
      eruption which is characterized by intense itching <i><font color="#0000ff">when undressing to
      go to bed</font></i>. This eruption may be vesicular, like army or prairie itch, or may look
      like simple urticaria. Itching on undressing is also found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
      sulphuricum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Oleander</font></i>, but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> this itching is apt to be found in connection with jaundice
      or malarial symptoms. If we should get intense itching over the body, which was aggravated by
      warmth, especially <i><font color="#0000ff">warmth of the bed</font></i>, we would think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius solubilis</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">protoiodide</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a very unique remedy. I do not know of one that stands so far apart
      from any and all others, and its peculiar and characteristic symptoms are capable of such
      remarkable verification in different diseases as would, or ought to, convince the most
      skeptical of the truth of <i><font color="#0000ff">Similia Similibus Curantur</font></i>, etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Hering's "Guiding Symptoms", gives it in the best rendering. Let
      us quote a few of the best symptoms: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Appearance of raw, bloody
      surface, on lips, buccal cavity, nose, etc</font></i>." "<i><font color="#0000ff">Patients
      often pick and bore into the raw surfaces, though doing so gives great pain, and they scream
      with it but keep up the boring</font></i>.". (<i><font color="#0000ff">Hellebor. nig</font></i>.)
      There is also one other symptom not so well expressed in Hering, viz.: That these raw surfaces
      are very <b><font color="#ff0000">red</font></b>, like a piece of fresh beefsteak in
      appearance. Notice that in Hering these symptoms of mouth, tongue and nose are given in
      connection with <i><font color="#0000ff">Scarlatina</font></i> mainly. I want to say that they
      are also found in typhoid and typhus fevers. Whenever, in any disease, this red, raw condition
      of the mouth, nose and lips, at which the patient bores and picks, continually appears, give <i><font color="#0000ff">Arum triphyllum</font></i>. Another important use of this remedy is in
      affections of the larynx and bronchia. Hoarseness or loss of voice, or voice uncontrollable;
      it breaks when trying to sing or speak in a high tone or key. This is often found in
      clergyman's sore throat, or in operatic singers. Aggravation of hoarseness from singing is
      also found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Argentum nitricum, Arnica, Selenium, Phosphorus</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is the leading remedy for <b><font color="#ff0000">bruises</font></b>
      and the results therefrom, and the symptoms -"<i><font color="#0000ff">Weakness,
      weariness, sensation as of being bruised</font></i>." "Felt as if bruised over the
      whole body," as found in the provings, explain the reason and the many cures it has made,
      even in the high and highest potencies, of both acute and chronic affections. The result of
      trauma is another evidence of the truth of our law of cure. One of the best characteristics is
      "<i><font color="#0000ff">Everything on which he lies </font></i>seems too hard" (<i><font color="#0000ff">Pyrogen</font></i>.); he must keep changing his position to get relief. This
      is because of the sensation of <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness as if bruised all over</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> has -"Feels as if lying on a board; changes

      <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> has- "Feels sore all

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i> has -"All parts of the body on which he lies are
      painful as if bruised."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here are five remedies which seem much alike, and other might be added,
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i>, which has -All the limbs are <i><font color="#0000ff">sore</font></i> as if bruised, and as if there were no strength in them, and</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> -"<i><font color="#0000ff">He is sore all over</font></i>,
      in the joints, the bones, and the periosteum, as if they had been sprained, like a drawing,
      tearing, especially in the spine, the sacrum, the knees and thighs." Now to know thus far
      of these remedies would be of little use for therapeutic purposes, for it would be senseless
      to prescribe all of these remedies mixed together, and full as much so to prescribe one of
      them to the exclusion of all the rest without a good reason for so doing. Fortunately there is
      always a possibility of making choice between them, but it is not always easy. Take, for
      instance, <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>.
      Both have the symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">sore bruised feeling</font></i>. Both have
      feeling as if the bed were <i><font color="#0000ff">too hard</font></i>. Both have <i><font color="#0000ff">stupor</font></i>, from which they can be aroused, but fall quickly back into
      it again. Both have a dark streak running through the tongue.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Both have a <i><font color="#0000ff">deep red face</font></i>, and all
      these similarities often occur in the course of a typhoid fever. How are we to choose between
      them? <i><font color="#0000ff">Look further</font></i>. If in addition to these symptoms the
      patient "tosses about the bed, reaching here and there, and in his delirium complaining
      that he cannot <i><font color="#0000ff">get himself together</font></i>." <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> is the remedy, or if the stool, urine and sweat are <i><font color="#0000ff">extremely offensive</font></i>, it is <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>.
      If the stool and urine are passed unconsciously and there appear suggillations under the skin,
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> is the remedy. Now here are only a few of the
      characteristic differences. There are others, and we must "watch out" for them. It
      is no harder to choose between these two remedies than it is to choose sometimes between <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i> in the
      same disease. Here is the place where the old physician might exhort the young as Paul did
      Timothy. "Study to show thyself approved, * * * a workman that needed not to be ashamed,
      rightly dividing the truth, etc." Such close prescribing is business of course, and is
      also <b><font color="#ff0000">successful</font></b>. If I came to a case that had the bruised
      sensation very markedly in connection with a diphtheritic throat I would not give <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, because it does not have that kind of throat; but <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> has, and it has one other symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, viz.: <i><font color="#0000ff">heat and redness of head and
      face, while the body and limbs are cool or cold</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have met many such cases of diphtheria, and if prescribed early <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> cures without the aid of any other remedy. Again if I
      found a patient with the sore, bruised sensation, who was brought into that condition by
      getting wet while perspiring, or by lying on damp ground, or between damp sheets, or from a
      strain of the muscles, <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i> would be the
      remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If in cases of actual injury I should find the bruise in the periosteum or
      bone, I should expect more benefit from <i><font color="#0000ff">Ruta</font></i>, which seems
      to be better also than <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. in one kind of muscular
      strain, viz., strain of the ciliary muscles. I have often relieved sewing girls or students of
      pains in the eyes from this cause and have sometimes enabled them to lay off the glasses that
      had been prescribed by the opticians. It is much better to use this remedy in a weakened power
      of accommodation than to try and compensate for it with artificial lenses. Of course where the
      impaired vision is purely optical this cannot be done.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">So we might go on to draw the diagnostic symptoms between all the various
      remedies having a similar symptom if we had time and space. But it would not be the best thing
      to do, for every physician should get in the habit of doing this for himself.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In addition to all that has been said about the great value of the <i><font color="#0000ff">sore as if</font></i> bruised sensation of this remedy, it should always be
      remembered in affections, acute or chronic, which are the <i><font color="#0000ff">result of
      trauma</font></i>. Among these are concussion; fracture of the skull with compression of the
      brain; headaches of long standing; meningitis: apoplexy; inflammation of the eyes with
      suggillations, or even retinal hæmorrhages, where it expedites the absorption of the blood
      clots, deafness, epistaxis, newly filled teeth, affections from blows on stomach or other
      viscera. I once cured a man who had suffered from what he and his physician had called
      dyspepsia for several years. He had been obliged to give up his business because he could not
      eat enough to support his strength. He had been told by his physician that he would never be
      well again and had given up hopes himself. This condition was caused by the kick of a horse
      upon the region of the stomach. A few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>
      200th cured him in a short time and he resumed his business. Now I will conclude <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> with a few characteristics that are genuine, and have been,
      with me, of inestimable value.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Stupor with involuntary discharge of fæces and urine."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Fears being struck or touched by those coming towards him."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Putrid smell from the mouth."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Offensive eructations or flatus, smelling like rotten eggs."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Bruised sore feeling in uterine region, cannot walk erect."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Soreness of parts after labor prevents hæmorrhages or pyæmia."</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">"It is the <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> of the
      veins."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">From clinical use we know enough of the remedy to value it highly in
      varicosities of almost all kinds. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Fluoric acid</font></i>.) It is
      here a powerful rival of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, but except the
      soreness of the veins we do not know of guiding symptoms for its use.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has produced, in provings, severe hæmorrhages, and clinical use has
      defined the bleeding to be of very dark clotted, venous blood. There is no doubt of its power
      over such hæmorrhages, whether occurring from the nose, bowels, uterus, lungs or bladder. I
      have used it in every place with satisfaction. It is not a powerful poison and can be used low
      without bad effects. One of its best uses is in orchitis and inflammation of the spermatic
      veins, the provings markedly indicating its homœopathicity here. In hæmorrhages from the
      anus, whether from piles or typhoid fever, if the blood is of the above described appearance, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hamamelis</font></i> is excellent.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Calendula, Hamamelis</font></i> has often seemed to act well as a local

      external injuries, which <i><font color="#0000ff">are not diseases</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">No remedy produces more severe colic than this one, and no remedy cures
      more promptly.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. T. L. Brown once said to me in substance: If I was disposed to be
      skeptical as to the power of the small dose to cure, <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynthis</font></i>
      would convince me, for I have so promptly cured severe colic in many cases, from a child to
      adults, and even in horses. Of course, every true Homœopath can respond <i><font color="#0000ff">amen</font></i> to that.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The colic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynthis</font></i> is terrible,
      and is only bearable by <i><font color="#0000ff">bending double</font></i>, or <i><font color="#0000ff">pressing something hard against the abdomen</font></i>. He leans over chairs,
      the table or bed posts to get relief. This colic is neuralgic in character, and is often
      attended with vomiting and diarrhœa, which seems to be a result of the great pain more than
      any particular derangement of the stomach or bowels. We often find it in connection with
      dysentery. My experience has been that it does not, as a rule, occur in the first stage of the
      disease, but later, when the disease has not been fully controlled by <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite,
      Mercurius, Nux vomica</font></i> and that class of remedies, but has extended upward to the
      small intestines. The pains are of a <i><font color="#0000ff">crampy</font></i> nature. The
      remedy that comes nearest to <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> for colic is <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phosphorica</font></i> especially in colic in children. They both
      have the cramping pains, but the pains of <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>.
      are most relieved by hot applications like <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>. Both
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>.
      are also equally efficacious for neuralgic affections in other localities, for instance, in
      sciatica and prosopalgia, and even uterine colic of a neuralgic nature, though in this latter
      affection <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>. leads. Remember the modalities,
      for upon the individualization depends the choice between them. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> resemble each other, in that both have colic
      from a fit of anger or other neuralgic affections from the same cause. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> succeeds in the colic of children, if there is much wind
      which distends the abdomen; the child tosses about in agony, but does not double up like <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>. Other symptoms often come in of course and help to
      choose between them. If both fail I have succeeded with <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia
      phos. Staphisagria</font></i> is also a remedy for colicky children, with disposition like <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>. In
      such children the teeth grow black and decay early. Again the <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i>
      child is often troubled with sore eyelids. In such a case there is chronic tendency to colic
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> is sometimes the only remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum album</font></i> also has colic, bending the patient double, similar
      to <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>, but the patient walks about for relief, or
      is much prostrated and has cold sweats, especially on the <b><font color="#ff0000">forehead</font></b>.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i> has colic relieved by bending double, after
      eating.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Dioscorea</font></i> is a good remedy for <i><font color="#0000ff">wind</font></i>
      Colic. The Pain begins right at the umbilicus, and then radiates all over the abdomen, and
      even to extremities (<i><font color="#0000ff">Plumbum</font></i>, with walls retracted), and,
      unlike <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>, the pain is aggravated by bending
      forward and relieved by straightening the body out. <i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum</font></i>
      is a colic remedy, and the only way the child is relieved is by being carried with the abdomen
      on the mother's shoulder. I have cured a case of this kind. It was a very obstinate case of
      long standing in a weakly child. The usual remedies had signally failed. <i><font color="#0000ff">Jalapa</font></i> cured one of the most obstinate cases of long standing that
      I ever saw, the child crying almost continually day and night for weeks. There was in this
      case diarrhœa all the time. Both colic and diarrhœa were very quickly cured. I have
      lengthened out these indications for colic remedies in connection with <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> because there is great temptation, especially with young
      physicians, to give "paregoric," soothing syrups, etc., because it is not always
      easy to find the homœopathic remedy. I never have to do it, and I cure my cases. Of course
      there are many other remedies for the same trouble, and all have their particular <i><font color="#0000ff">guiding symptoms</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i> not only cures neuralgic affections originating in the
      abdominal region, but has been very efficacious in facial and sciatic neuralgia. The pains in
      these localities, like those in the abdomen, are of a decidedly crampy nature. Here also <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia phos</font></i>. often disputes place with <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>,
      in the fact of its also having characteristically the same kind of pains. The relief from
      heat, although found under both remedies, is most marked under <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia
      phos</font></i>. In sciatica, the pain of <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>
      extends from the hip down the posterior portion of the thigh into the popliteal fossa (&gt;
      lying on painful side, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>). <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>,
      the pains run down the <i><font color="#0000ff">outer</font></i> side of the thigh. These two
      remedies, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Gnaphalium</font></i>, are the leading remedies for
      the treatment of this most distressing malady. But of course other remedies often have to be
      given, and the indications are sometimes found outside of the local trouble, as they are in
      many other diseases. One of the worst cases of sciatica I ever saw was cured with <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum album</font></i>, on the indications, worse at midnight, especially
      from 1 to 3 o'clock; burning pains; and the only temporary relief during the paroxysms, was
      from bags of hot, dry salt applied to the painful part.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The lady was a sister of Charles Saunders, of New York, of school reader
      fame, who was himself a cripple from allopathically treated sciatica. She, after suffering
      indescribable agony for six weeks, was cured rapidly and permanently with a dose of Jenichen's
      8m of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum album</font></i>. So we see again that no remedy and
      no particular set of remedies can be entirely relied upon, but the indicated <i><font color="#0000ff">one</font></i> can. These are the chief uses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">One of our best anti-psoric remedies. The eruptions that it causes and
      cures are very similar in appearance to those of <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>.
      They appear on different parts of the body, as scalp, behind ears, on scrotum, female
      genitals, hands, feet and legs, etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is one very marked characteristic symptom that guides to this remedy
      out of a large list having similar eruptions, and that is that the eruption is worse during
      the winter season (<i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe, Alumina, Psorinum</font></i>). There is no
      other remedy that has this so prominently. The hands chap, crack and bleed, and are all
      covered with <i><font color="#0000ff">eczema during the winter and get well in summer</font></i>.
      I hake cured a case of eczema of the lower legs of twenty years' standing, always worse in
      winter, with one prescription of the 200th. I have cured chapped hands the same way. I once
      had a very obstinate case of chronic diarrhœa, but as soon as the fact that he had eczema of
      the hands in winter came to light I cured him quickly of the whole trouble with <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i> 200th. Chilblains (<i><font color="#0000ff">Agaricus</font></i>),
      which are moist, and itch and burn much in cold weather, are also cured by it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i>; also has a symptom similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar
      sulphuris</font></i>, viz., the slightest scratch of abrasion of the skin suppurates. You
      remember that <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphuris</font></i> is also worse in cold
      weather or cold air. <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i> has headache in the <i><font color="#0000ff">occiput, which is as heavy as lead</font></i>, also vertigo in the occiput.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i> is one of our best
      remedies for seasickness. In this it resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Cocculus</font></i>.
      Another curious symptom is cracking of the joints. This is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>.
      Both of these remedies are valuable in chronic rheumatism, especially where this symptom is
      present. <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i> has, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Anacardium</font></i>, a symptom, pain in stomach, <i><font color="#0000ff">relieved</font></i> by eating. Again it is valuable in diarrhœa and
      dysentery, which is worse <i><font color="#0000ff">during the day</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroleum</font></i> deserves to be classed with the leading anti-psorics,
      such as <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur, Graphites, Causticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.</p>

      symptoms.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is more celebrated remedy with the eclectics than with us. They
      especially value it for what they call its <i><font color="#0000ff">tonic</font></i>
      properties and its specific action in the way of healing ulcerations in mucous membranes. We
      have also found it useful in such cases, but we have more decided indications for its use. For
      instance, in stomach troubles, where they attribute it curative powers to its tonic
      properties, we find it especially valuable only when we have this symptom present: "Dull
      aching pain in stomach which causes a very <i><font color="#0000ff">weak, faint, gone feeling</font></i>
      in the epigastrium." The stomach is sometimes actually sunken (objectively). There are
      two other remedies that have this symptom to a degree almost equal, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Sepia</font></i> is generally in connection with uterine affections while <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> is purely nervous. <i><font color="#0000ff">Hydrastis</font></i>
      is a good remedy for chronic constipation. E. M. Hale taught that it must be used in tincture
      or very low dilution. I have found it most efficacious in the 200th. (B. &amp; T.). I once
      cured a case that was of years' standing, had worn cathartics out, and all the way she could
      live (her words) was to swallow a spoonful of whole flaxseed with every meal. I have used it
      in infantile constipation successfully, and it is almost useful when all other symptoms aside
      from the constipation are conspicuous for their <i><font color="#0000ff">absence</font></i>.
      Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hydrastis</font></i> is indicated in affections of mucous
      membranes where there is a <i><font color="#0000ff">viscid</font></i> stringy discharge. This
      is like <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bichromicum</font></i>, but the other symptoms of these
      two remedies are not much alike.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Chronic bronchitis of old debilitated people is sometimes greatly relieved

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Pains disappear when thinking of them; exceedingly sensitive to cold air.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The great characteristic around which the whole action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> seems to revolve is: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Great
      coldness of the external surface, with sudden and complete prostration of the vital forces.</font></i>"
      It is no wonder Hahnemann headed his trio (<i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor, Cuprum</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hellebore</font></i>) of cholera remedies with <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i>. If we were to sum up the same condition in one word it
      would be <i><font color="#0000ff">collapse</font></i>. No remedy comes nearer to <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> than the last of the trio, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum
      album</font></i>, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> has the collapse with
      painless stool or even no stool at all, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i> has
      the collapse seemingly as a consequence of the very profuse evacuations of stomach and bowels.
      Both have great external coldness, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i> has a very
      marked appearance of <i><font color="#0000ff">cold sweat</font></i> upon the hippocratic face,
      especially <b><font color="#ff0000">forehead</font></b>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Cuprum</font></i>
      leads the trio, when the <i><font color="#0000ff">cramp</font></i> in stomach and extremities
      is the most prominent symptom. These remedies are indicated when these characteristic symptoms
      appear, not only in cholera, but in any disease. There is one peculiarity in the coldness of <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i>, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">the patient will not be
      covered, or objects to it, no matter how objectively cold he is. Secale</font></i> coldness or
      collapse is exactly like this, and even in gangrena senilis it proves a great remedy on the
      same indications. The signal success of Dr. Rubini, of Naples, in treating five hundred and
      ninety-two cases of cholera with <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> verified the
      prediction of Hahnemann beyond question.</p>
      <p align="justify">Collapse with cold surface and aversion to heat may come on in retrocedent
      exanthema, or in the later stage of so-called cholera infantum, in pneumonia, or capillary
      bronchitis, from exposure to intense cold or traumatic shock. Indeed it does not matter from
      what cause except death. <i><font color="#0000ff">Camphor</font></i> is the first remedy to be
      thought of, and according to susceptibility or strength of the patient the dose must be varied
      from tincture to highest potency.</p>
