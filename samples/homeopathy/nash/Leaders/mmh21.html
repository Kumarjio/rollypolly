      sycotic excrescences, etc.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Hahnemann recognized three miasms (as he called them) which complicated the
      treatment of all diseases. They were syphilis, psora and sycosis.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> was his chief anti-psoric, <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>
      his anti-syphilitic and <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> his anti-sycotic.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Whatever may be said against his theories along this line, certain it is
      that these three remedies do correct certain <i><font color="#0000ff">states</font></i> of the
      system which seem to obstruct the curative action of other seemingly well-indicated remedies.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>, for instance, cures or so changes the existing conditions
      that other remedies cure which could not do so before <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>
      was given. Many diseases of various forms come under this rule. Whenever warts, condylomata,
      fig-warts etc., which come in consequence of gonorrhœal affections, <i><font color="#0000ff">especially
      suppressed, gonorrhœa</font></i>, are found in any case we think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>.
      For instance, a case of enuresis had resisted many seemingly indicated remedies, until the
      hands were discovered to be covered with warts, when a few drops of <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>
      cured. Of course, the curative power of <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> is not
      confined to sycosis, but can, like other remedies, cure when symptoms indicate it where no
      sycotic element in the case is apparent. Nevertheless, its chief power is manifested in those
      cases in which this miasm is unmistakably present. It is astonishing what widely different and
      varied forms of disease will be so modified by this miasm as to call for anti-sycotic
      treatment.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">As <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> is not the only anti-psoric,
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> the only anti-syphilitic, so <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> is not the only anti-sycotic; for <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric
      acid, Staphisagria, Sabina, Cinnabaris</font></i> and other remedies are sometimes called for,
      either before or after <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>, or even when <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> is not at all the remedy. But on the whole, <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>, perhaps, as Hahnemann taught, stands at the head of the
      list. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja, Agaricus </font></i>and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      have been called over-proven remedies; but when we realize the wide range of diseases which
      are complicated by the sycotic element in them we are not so sure of the over-proving of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i>, for it could not so benefit such a wide range of complaints
      if it could not produce a wide range of symptoms in its pathogenesis. This is also true of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i>. <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> has some very peculiar symptoms of the mind which have been
      verified.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Fixed ideas, as if a strange person were at his side; as if the soul
      and body were separated; that the body and particularly the <i><font color="#0000ff">limbs
      were made of glass, and will readily</font></i> break; as if a living animal were in the
      abdomen; tells about being under the influence of a superior power." Insane women will
      not be touched or approached. Aside from these curious mind symptoms we have: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Headaches of sycotic origin, with various symptoms; white dandruff, hair
      falling out or grows slowly and splits; eyelids bear styes, chalazæ, tarsal tumors, or
      condylomata; ears inflame, discharge pus, or grow polypi. Nose discharges thick, green mucus
      like Pulsatilla, or scabs are formed in it; warts on the outside of the nose or eruptions on
      its wings; face has a greasy or shiny look; teeth begin to decay at the roots as soon as they
      come, the crowns remaining sound. Ranula under the tongue, or varicosities in the mouth or
      throat; a great deal of croaking, rumbling and grumbling in the abdomen, as if of an animal
      crying; abdomen puffed and big, protruding here and there as if from the arm of a fœtus, or
      of something alive; constipation of hard black balls; chronic; stools large; and stool recedes
      after being partially expelled (Sanic., Silic.); or diarrhœa forcibly expelled, copious
      gurgling like water from a bung hole of a barrel; diarrhœa, especially from the effects of
      vaccination; anus fissured or surrounded with condylomata</font></i> (see <i><font color="#0000ff">Antim. crud., Graphites</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>);
      <i><font color="#0000ff">ovarian troubles; asthma; nails brittle, distorted, crumbling,
      misshapen or soft; warts, condylomata, bleeding fungous growths; nœvi; epithelioma, and many
      other affections in sycotic subjects</font></i>." Finally don't forget to look for the
      three miasms in all obstinate cases, whether acute or chronic.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Ailments from indignation and vexation or reserved displeasure;
      sleeplessness."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I quote all these symptoms in order to impress the reader with the value of
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> as a mind remedy. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i>
      is often used when <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> would be better,
      especially for children, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> is sometimes used
      for adults the same way.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid</font></i> is sometimes used for the results of onanism
      when <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> would do better. You will also notice
      that this remedy may be indicated for the <i><font color="#0000ff">effects</font></i> of anger
      instead of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>.
      Here are <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla, Nux vomica Cina, Colocynth</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> standing very close to each other for <i><font color="#0000ff">cross, ugly, irritable subjects</font></i>, and there are few cases that one
      or the other will not fit. Then we have <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphoric acid, Natrum
      muriaticum, Anacardium, Aurum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i>
      for the apathetic or hypochondriacal.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> has a sensation as if the <i><font color="#0000ff">stomach
      were hanging down relaxed. Ipecac</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Tabacum</font></i>,
      have the same sensation.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sometimes it is described as a sinking sensation. It also has the same
      sensation in the abdomen; feels as though it would drop, wants to support it with the hands.
      Colic, which might be styled "<i><font color="#0000ff">habitual colic</font></i>,"
      in <i><font color="#0000ff">scrawny, ugly, pot-bellied children</font></i>, and especially if
      they suffer much with their teeth, <i><font color="#0000ff">which turn black, with tender,
      spongy gums</font></i>, which are sensitive and painful.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now when we add dysentery to the foregoing, we see that <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> acts along the whole intestinal tract. <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> is one of the remedies which has a marked
      characteristic aggravation <i><font color="#0000ff">after the least food or drink</font></i>.
      This remedy has a very peculiar symptom, which appeared in the provings, and which I have
      verified, viz., "burning in the urethra when <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i>
      urinating." While urinating the burning ceased. We have plenty of remedies for burning
      before, during and after urination, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> is
      the only one having this burning all the time between the acts of urinating. In addition to
      being one of the best remedies for onanism, it is one of the best for affections of the
      prostrate gland in old men, with frequent urination and dribbling of urine afterwards. A very
      common and troublesome symptom found in connection with troubles of the genital organs, both
      male and female, is <i><font color="#0000ff">backache</font></i>, which is very peculiar, in
      that it is <i><font color="#0000ff">always worse at night in bed and in the morning before
      rising</font></i>. It is a very efficacious remedy here. <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i>
      is a good skin remedy. It cures both dry and moist eruptions. The eczema of <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i> oozes an acrid moisture from under the scabs, and new
      vesicles form from the contact of the exudation. They generally itch very severely, and one
      peculiarity is, that when the itching is relieved by scratching in one place it immediately
      appears in another. The eczema is often on the head, on the sides around the ears, but the
      most marked action is in the eyelids. Herring's card expresses it thus: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Styes, nodosities, chalazæ on eyelids, one after another, sometimes
      ulcerating</font></i>." There is only one remedy that can compare with this one in
      chronic blepharitis, and that is <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> (see also <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i>). It has some remarkable cures of cross, puny, sickly
      children, having the teeth and eyelid symptoms. Not only were the local troubles remedied, but
      the <i><font color="#0000ff">patient was cured</font></i> every way.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I think of but two other uses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Staphisagria</font></i>,
      which I wish to mention. <i><font color="#0000ff">First</font></i>, its use in the cure of
      condylomata, figwarts, or cauliflower-like excrescences. In one case, with the 200th of this
      remedy, I removed an excrescence on the perinæum of a lady in which the growth was an inch
      long and the appearance was exactly in appearance like cauliflower. It rapidly disappeared
      under the action of this remedy and never returned. <i><font color="#0000ff">Second</font></i>,
      its use for <i><font color="#0000ff">Incised wounds</font></i>. It is the best remedy here,
      where there is a clean cut as after surgical operations. It is to such wounds what <i><font color="#0000ff">Calendula</font></i> is to lacerations, <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica,
      Hamamelis, Ledum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph. acid</font></i> for bruises, <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox., Calcarea ostrearum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux
      vomica</font></i> for strains; <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea phosphorica</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Symphytum</font></i> for fractures.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy has one of the most positive and reliable characteristic
      symptoms in the whole Materia Medica, and one which cannot be accounted for from any
      pathological standpoint that I know of. I mention this here because there is a seeming desire
      on the part of some to base all their prescriptions on pathological indications. I have no
      objections to their doing so if they can and succeed in curing their patients. But I claim
      full recognition for the value of those subjective, sensational symptoms and the modalities
      which cannot be accounted for. Indeed, I feel quite sure that the well-verified subjective
      symptoms are oftener to be relied upon in curing our patients than all the pathological
      conditions we know. Now for the symptom. "<i><font color="#0000ff">The smell of food
      cooking nauseates to faintness</font></i>." To illustrate the value of this symptom I
      will give a case of my own practice; it was also my first experience with a potency as high as
      the 200th. Patient was a lady, seventy-five years of age, who was suddenly seized with
      sickness at the stomach and vomiting of blood in large quantities; then bloody stools
      followed, which were at first profuse, then became small and of bloody mucus. There was great
      tenesmus and pain in the bowels. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Mercurius, Nux vomica,
      Ipecacuanha, Hamamelis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>, all tried
      as well as I knew how to select them at that time, but no relief came, and at the end of
      twelve days my patient was rapidly going down and it looked to me as though she must die. She
      had become so weak that she could not lift her head from the pillow. By actual count the
      number of stools passed on cloths in the bed was sixty-five, in twenty-four hours, the pains,
      number of passages and an symptoms were aggravated from; sundown to sunrise (this is another
      characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now during ad this sickness this patient had been so nauseated and faint at
      the smell of cooking food that they had been obliged to keep the doors closed between her
      bedroom and the kitchen, which was two large rooms away. I was not so well acquainted with
      Materia Medica then as now, and while I did not overlook the symptom did not know of any
      remedy that had it. But I had my Lippe text-book of Materia Medica in my carriage and I went
      out and got it and sat down by the bedside; determined to find that peculiar and persistent
      symptom and "fight it out on that line if it tom all summer" I began at <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> and looked at the stomach symptoms of every remedy, until,
      the first time I remembered ever having noticed it there it stood in plain English under <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i>. Then I looked in my medicine case for the remedy. None
      there, and I was four miles from home. I had a box of Dunham's 200ths under my carriage seat
      that had been there for over a year, but which I had never used for want of confidence in high
      potencies. It was the best I could do for the present, so I dissolved a few pellets in a
      half-glass of cold water, and directed to give one teaspoonful after every passage of the
      bowels. On my way home I stopped my horse two or three times to turn around and go back and
      give that poor suffering woman some medicine. I felt guilty, but I said to myself this is
      Lippe's <i><font color="#0000ff">Materia Medica</font></i>, and these are Carroll Dunham's
      potencies, and here is a clean cut indication for its administration, and the other symptoms
      do not counter-indicate. Well, I got home. But I started early the next morning to try and
      make amends for my rashness (if the patient was not dead) of yesterday. Imagine my surprise as
      I stepped into the sick-room when my patient slowly turned her head upon the pillow and said,
      with a smile, "Good morning, Doctor." I had been met with a groan several past
      mornings. I felt faint myself then. I dropped into a chair by the bedside and remarked,
      "You are feeling better." "Oh, yes Doctor." "How much of that last
      medicine did you take?" "Two doses." "What!" "Two doses; I only
      had two more stools after you left." "Don't you have any more pain?" "Pain
      stopped like that" (putting her hands together) "and I feel well except
      weakness." She took no more medicine, quickly recovered, and was perfectly well for five
      years after, and finally died at eighty years of age. I never got over that surprise.
      Convinced against my will, but not of the same opinion still.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now I fell to experimenting with the 200th in down-right earnest. I have
      cured many cases since of autumnal dysentery with this remedy on the same indication, and with
      the same potency. I have also cured a very severe case of typhlitis (now called appendicitis,
      for which they so often operate with more deaths than were ever known before the operation
      became popular) on the same symptom, which was markedly present in the case. Bright's disease,
      a bad case, was also cured by it. Rheumatism, gout and dropsies have been cured, this symptom
      being present, and so I have been at length in giving my experience with this remedy in order
      to prove three things:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st. That we should not be influenced by prejudice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2d. That subjective symptoms are most valuable.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">3d. That the 200ths do act and <i><font color="#0000ff">cure</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Of course, there are other valuable symptoms besides the one upon which we
      have laid such particular stress. For instance, <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i>
      has two symptoms that are opposite one to the other, viz.: Violent <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">icy coldness</font></i> in the stomach. These opposites are often
      found in the abdomen. Again, it is sometimes indicated in autumnal dysentery, the white or
      bloody mucous discharges having a <i><font color="#0000ff">shreddy appearance</font></i>,
      looking as if the mucous membrane had been scraped off the intestines, with great tenesmus. <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> has these stools, looking like scrapings, as prominently
      as <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i>, but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>
      the pain and tenesmus implicate the urinary organs at the same time. <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>
      also has such stools, but the doubling-up, colicky pains distinguish it from both the others. <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i> has great meteoritic distention of the abdomen. It is in
      the 200th potency a good remedy for the bloating of cows that have eaten too much green
      clover. In dyspepsia, when there is complaint of burning or sensation of coldness in the
      stomach, and much gas in stomach or abdomen, or both, <i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i>
      is excellent, taking sometimes preference over <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo vegetabilis,
      China</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Colchicum</font></i> is always set down in the text-books for rheumatism,
      articular, migrating and gouty, and I have often tried it, but never with anything like the
      success of our other rheumatic remedies. I have been greatly disappointed in it here. Perhaps
      I did not use it <i><font color="#0000ff">low</font></i> enough. It is also said to be a good
      remedy for weakness or sudden prostration, but here I have no personal experience with it.
      However, if in any of these troubles, or others, I should find its prime characteristic

      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st. In hæmorrhages from different parts. The blood is <i><font color="#0000ff">black, viscid, clotted, and forming itself into long black strings from the
      bleeding orifice</font></i>. It makes no difference whether from the nose, uterus, lungs or
      stomach, if the blood is of this nature <i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i> must be
      given. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Mercur. sol</font></i>., the blood hangs from the nose like

      <p align="JUSTIFY">2d. In hysterical conditions in which there is great changeableness of the
      mental symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The patient is alternately cheerful or depressed. In the former state she
      will sing, dance, jump, laugh and whistle, love and want to kiss everybody. In the latter she
      will cry, get into a rage, abuse her friends, and then repent it, etc.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i>, for these alternate mental states, resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Ignatia</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux moschata</font></i>,
      but with <i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i> there is another peculiar and persistent
      symptom, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">sensation as of something morning, or hopping about in
      the stomach, abdomen, uterus or chest</font></i>. Often this sensation of movement is so
      positive that the patient mistakes it for the movement of a fœtus, and is sure she is in a
      family way. If the mind symptoms above described are present, don't be too ready to promise a
      baby, but give a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i> and await developments.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">3d. <i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i> is one of our remedies for
      chronic affections. <i><font color="#0000ff">There are twitchings of single sets of muscles</font></i>

      in hysterical subjects, and there are many remedies for them, so that one could not of course
      prescribe on that alone. There are, however, remedies which are suited to hysteria and also
      other nervous disease, in which twitchings are very prominent and <i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i>
      is one of them.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy, although an old one, is not universally appreciated. Its
      action upon the nervous system is very marked. In the first place it manifests itself in what
      is called nervousness in regard to <i><font color="#0000ff">noises</font></i>, to which the
      patient is very sensitive. Almost any noise, as a cough, a sneeze, restling of a newspaper, a
      cry, distant shot, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> is sometimes given for
      this starting at noises; when <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i> would do better. Then
      there is another very peculiar nervous symptom, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">fear of
      falling, from downward motion</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsem., Sanicula</font></i>).
      The child cries out and clings to the nurse when she attempts to lay it down in the cradle.
      Carrying it down stairs has the same effect. It will scream and cling to the nurse as long as
      the downward motion continues. Adults get the same symptom. Will not sit in a rocking chair,
      or ride on horseback, or on the waves, or swing, or go coasting, because of this dread of
      downward motion. There is only one other remedy having this symptom that I know of, and that
      is <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>, and so far I think that this has only
      appeared in intermittent fever.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">A child may be sleeping quietly and awake suddenly screaming and holding on
      to the sides of the cradle, without an apparent cause for so doing, or it may start from sleep
      clinging to the nurse as if frightened. In such cases we might think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis mellifica, Belladonna, Cina. Stramonium</font></i>, etc., but don't
      prescribe on the one symptom. Look at the child's mouth and if you should find an <i><font color="#0000ff">aphthous sore mouth</font></i> it would settle it pretty surely for <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i>. Then, again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i> has a
      very strong action as a general remedy, even domestic, from "way back," and has been
      prescribed without rhyme or reason until the homœopaths took it and found its exact place.
      Now the choice has to be made between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius, Hydrastis,
      Sulphur</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphuric acid</font></i>. etc.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It is not necessary to draw the line between the different remedies here,
      but I will say that the sore mouth itself is only <i><font color="#0000ff">one symptom</font></i>
      in every case. The rest are found outside the local affection and often have more to do with
      the final choice of the remedy. The nervous symptoms already mentioned are
      "pointers," for <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i>. Not only upon the mucous
      membranes of the mouth is this action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i> notable,
      but upon every other one. The <i><font color="#0000ff">eyelashes become gummy and stick
      together, or turn inward</font></i>. The ears discharge. I cured a case of otorrhœa of
      fourteen years' standing with this remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dry crusts form in the nose and re-form if removed. <i><font color="#0000ff">Greenish stools day and night, with aphthæ</font></i>. The infant cries when
      urinating or before, showing an inflamed condition of the urethra. If the crying spells before
      urinating should be followed with a deposit of sand in the diaper or vessel, <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Sarsaparilla</font></i>
      would be thought of.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The mucous membranes of the respiratory organs are also affected. There is
      cough, and expectoration of an <i><font color="#0000ff">offensive herby taste</font></i>. Then
      we have decided pleuritis in the chest, in the right pectoral region.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">

      down.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These altogether show the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Borax</font></i>
      upon the mucous membranes. Like <i><font color="#0000ff">Chamomilla, Hepar sulphuris</font></i>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">When writing upon <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, I there
      compared several remedies which have a sensation as if bruised. This remedy might also have
      been mentioned there, as it has "<i><font color="#0000ff">Bruised feeling as if broken,
      all over the body</font></i>." (<i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica, Bellis, Pyrogen</font></i>.)
      The bruised feeling of <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i> is accompanied with a <i><font color="#0000ff">deep hard aching</font></i>, as if in the <i><font color="#0000ff">bones</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Let us quote some of the symptoms illustrating: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Intense aching in the limbs and back as if the bones were broken."
      "Aching in the bones of the extremities, with soreness of the flesh; soreness of the
      bones." "Soreness and aching of the arms and forearms; painful soreness in both
      wrists as if broken or dislocated." "Soreness and aching of lower limbs; stiffness
      and general soreness when rising to walk." "Calves of the legs feel as if they had
      been beaten." "Aching pains as if in the bones, with moaning</font></i>." These
      symptoms are all characteristic and may be found in influenza, bilious or intermittent fever,
      bronchitis, especially of the aged, and many other diseases. This is what gave the popular
      name "bone-set" to <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i>, because on
      account of the severe aching, as if the bones were broken, that occurred in an epidemic of
      intermittent fever this was the remedy that cured, or "set the bones." The epidemic
      was called <i><font color="#0000ff">break-bone fever</font></i>. Of course this curative
      property of the drug was then discovered by accident, but abundant proving and verification
      have demonstrated the homœopathicity of such cures. So with <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
      in dropsies. If this remedy has no curative properties other than it has for intermittent it
      would still remain a priceless boon to Homœopathy. It cures a kind of intermittent for which
      the great anti-periodic (Quinine) of the old school can do little or nothing. Three
      characteristics stand out prominently, to indicate the cases in which it is appropriate:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">1st. As to time of chill -7 to 9 A. M.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">2d. The intense aching in the bones before the chill.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">3d. Vomiting of bile between chill and heat.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are, of course, other symptoms which may appear in a <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i> case, but these three are a sure guide, and many
      authentic cures corroborate the genuineness. This remedy is also very useful in diseases of
      the respiratory organs. In the so-called la grippe of recent years it has proven in my hands
      very valuable; the "aching all over as if in the bones" being the leading symptom.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It also has <i><font color="#0000ff">hoarseness in the morning</font></i>,
      like <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> but while <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
      has more <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> and rawness <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i>
      has more <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness</font></i> in the <i><font color="#0000ff">chest</font></i>;
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Ranunculus bulb</font></i>. has pain in the chest when walking,
      turning, from touch or weather changing; when coughing has to support the chest with the
      hands, it hurts so (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia, Drosera, Kreosot., Natrum sul., Sepia</font></i>).
      Both remedies have aching in the bones especially in influenza or la grippe, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i> the most. If either of these remedies fails to cure the
      hoarseness, <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> will often complement them.
      Altogether, <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i> is to be remembered in <i><font color="#0000ff">many diseases</font></i> having these characteristic symptoms. <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i> is especially adapted to <i><font color="#0000ff">worn</font></i>
      out constitutions of old people or inebriates. <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> is
      near analogue, having <i><font color="#0000ff">free sweat</font></i>, but pains keep patient
      quiet, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Eupatorium</font></i> has scanty sweat, but pains make
      the patient restless.</p>

      a good one for urinary diseases. And Dr. Hughes says: "The drug has become my favorite
      remedy for vesical irritability in women." I have not yet tried it in such cases; but I
      have done some good work with it in intermittents, when the chill <i><font color="#0000ff">began
      in the small of the back and spread from there up and downward</font></i>, which is as near a

      there are <i><font color="#0000ff">bone pains</font></i> present. A lady who had lived near a
      marsh or swamp for seven years never had any appearance of malarial symptoms while living
      there, but after she came away they developed and were unyielding to the usual Quinine
      treatment. In fact, it utterly failed to do more than suppress for a short time when it would

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is not a remedy of very wide range, so far as yet known, but is of
      such marked utility within its range that we could not afford to lose it. Its action upon the
      respiratory organs is first to be considered. It first attacks the larynx, extends from there
      to the trachea, bronchial tubes and into the air cells of the lungs themselves. Next to <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> it is the remedy, oftenest indicated in croup. The cough is
      dry and sibilant, or <i><font color="#0000ff">sounds like a saw driven through a pine board</font></i>,
      each cough corresponding to a thrust of the saw. Croup often comes on after exposure to dry,
      cold winds. It generally comes on in the evening, with high fever, excitement and fearfulness.
      For this cause and these symptoms <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> is the first
      remedy, and in the 30th or 200th cures a great majority of cases without the aid of any other
      remedy. But if after a few doses, or a reasonable time, it does not alleviate, and the case
      continues to grow worse, and the paroxysms of cough and suffocation come on oftener, and
      especially on <i><font color="#0000ff">awakening out of sleep, Spongia</font></i> is generally
      the next remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I live in a croupy climate and district, and after experimenting for thirty
      years, first with the low, then with the higher preparations, affirm that the 200th potency of
      this remedy does better work in croup than the lower preparations. I often give either of
      these remedies (<i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i>),
      according to indications, as often as once in fifteen minutes in watery solutions until
      amelioration, and then lengthen the intervals between doses according to amelioration. After
      the Croup becomes loose, but still retaining some of its croupy sound, <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphuris</font></i> comes in, especially if inclined to get worse after
      midnight or in the morning hours. If the case inclines to relapse, or gets a little more
      croupy every evening, <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> will often finish the
      cure. In the laryngitis or bronchitis of adults, <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i>
      is as useful as it is in the case of croup in children. There is a <i><font color="#0000ff">great
      hoarseness, some soreness and burnings and the cough is worse on talking, reading, singing or
      swallowing.</font></i> I often find it particularly useful after <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      has improved the sore throat which often precedes the laryngeal or bronchial trouble, and
      which is generally brought on by colds so often contracted here in our northern climate.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In Chronic affections of the respiratory organs, which may finally lead to
      consumption, <i><font color="#0000ff">Spongia</font></i> vies with <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus,
      Sanguinaria</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>. There is soreness,
      burning, rawness and heaviness in the chest, while the cough is worse in the evening, from
      cold air, talking, singing or moving, and better from eating and drinking warm things. I will
      not attempt to give all the symptoms for its use in respiratory diseases, but proceed at once
      to its remarkable action upon the <i><font color="#0000ff">heart</font></i>. I have never done
      better work with any remedy in valvular disease than with Spongia. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Awakes out of sleep from a sense of suffocation, with violent, loud cough,
      great alarm, agitation, anxiety and difficult respiration</font></i>" is a key-note and
      is frequently met in valvular affections. No remedy, not even <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>,
      can do better here. Not only are these paroxysms relieved or stopped, but valvular murmurs of
