      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have had some valuable experience with this remedy in cystitis. It has
      made some fine cures where there were <i><font color="#0000ff">great quantities of ropy mucus
      in the urine</font></i>. There may be strangury or not in such cases. There is one symptom to
      which I wish to call attention, because it indicates that this remedy may become very useful
      in prostatic troubles, and is found under only one other remedy that I know of, viz., <i><font color="#0000ff">Cannabis Indica</font></i>. These prostatic troubles are very serious ones,
      and anything that can contribute to their successful treatment is valuable. The symptom is
      -"Sensation of swelling in the perinæum or near the anus, as if sitting on a ball."
      We often have very large amounts of mucus in the urine in prostatic troubles, and if I found
      it coupled with this sensation would expect benefit from the remedy. I know of no other use
      for this remedy at present. While we are here upon a urinary remedy, we will call attention to
      another comparatively new but good one.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy is sometimes successful in cases which are not relieved by <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>. There is as much inclination to urinate as with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>, and there is pain in the bladder, as if too full of
      urine, which must be voided in order to get relief from both pain and pressure, but urinating
      does not satisfy and he must soon go again. There is <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>
      in the urethra when urinating, but there are larger quantities of urine discharged than with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>, which has <i><font color="#0000ff">characteristically</font></i>
      very small amounts, but often repeated, even but a few drops at a time. <i><font color="#0000ff">Equisetum</font></i>, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Chimaphila</font></i>,
      sometimes shows excess of mucus, and it is also very useful in enuresis. Both <i><font color="#0000ff">Chimaphila</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Equisetum</font></i> need
      further proving to draw out their characteristic. <i><font color="#0000ff">Equisetum</font></i>
      sometimes has severe pain at the close of urination. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Berberis,

      <p align="CENTER">LAPIS ALBUS.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is the name given by Von Grauvogl to a species of gneiss that he found
      in the spring of Gastein. Goître and cretinism abound among the people who drink this water.
      Grauvogl experimented with it, and found it to cause burning and shooting pains in the cardia
      and pylorus, and also in the uterus and mammæ. In practice he found it remarkably successful
      in scrofulous affections, but that it did harm in cases that had previously suffered from
      malaria. He treated five cases of uterine carcinoma, pronounced true and incurable by
      allopaths, and cured them all. I have a case now under my care, to which I was called a year
      ago. She has a very large uterine fibroid. Under various remedies she grew worse, having
      hæmorrhages, frequently repeated, so profuse that it seemed as if she would bleed to death.
      The tumor, which involved the whole body of the womb, laid across the pelvis, the upper part,
      in the left sacro-iliac fossa, and the os, of course, exactly opposite in the other side of
      the pelvic cavity so far up on the other side that it was impossible with the speculum to get
      the least view of it. After the bleeding had gone on for months in this way the discharges
      became black and horribly offensive, and the os had a decidedly rough feel to the finger.
      Finally she began to complain of intense burning pains all through the diseased parts. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum album</font></i> effecting nothing for her, I put her upon <i><font color="#0000ff">Lapis albus</font></i> as an experiment, for I had no hope she could live more
      than two weeks at the longest. Under the action of this remedy she began to improve
      immediately, and from the half dead wreck that could not turn in bed without help, a skeleton,
      white as a ghost, she has steadily improved until she is now doing her own housework, the
      discharges having all ceased except her natural menses at her regular periods. The tumor grows
      smaller, and it seems as though she might get well. She takes a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lapis albus</font></i> 30th once a week.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="MEDORRHINUM"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">MEDORRHINUM.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The gonorrhœal virus, is undoubtedly a great remedy. Any one who has had
      much to do with gonorrhœa well knows the severe form of rheumatism, which is often the
      consequence of the introduction of this disease product into the system. I have seen some
      remarkable results from the use of this remedy in chronic forms of rheumatism. One case (a
      middle-aged lady) was not able to attend church, a few rods from her residence, for a long
      time, the trouble being in her feet and ankles and soles of the feet. The ankles were so sore
      and stiff and soles so tender that she could not walk on them. <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium
      crud</font></i>., which had cured some bad cases with similar symptoms for me, was without any
      beneficial effect, but Medorrhinum c. m., one dose, so benefited her that she could walk where
      she pleased. In the <i><font color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i> (journal), Vol. 3, Dr. J. A.
      Biegler, of Rochester, N. Y., reports a remarkable cure of chronic rheumatism in a man 60
      years of age. No history of previous gonorrhœa appears in the case, and I have never found
      any such history in the cases which I have been able to benefit with this remedy. In Vol. 1,
      of the same journal, is a remarkable cure reported by Dr. Skinner, of Liverpool, England. It
      is a cure of caries of the spine of long standing by <i><font color="#0000ff">Syphilinum</font></i>
      (high). I had a very similar case, for which I had been prescribing for over a year without
      success, when I first read the report of this case. In my case, as in his, the patient had
      severe pains in the diseased part <i><font color="#0000ff">during the night</font></i>. Every
      one acquainted with syphilitic troubles, especially of the bones, knows of these (terrible,
      sometimes) nightly bone pains. Three doses of Swan's <i><font color="#0000ff">Syphilinum</font></i>
      c. m. cured this case in the remarkably short space of forty days. I could not find any
      reliable history of syphilis in this case. Then the question arises, is Swan's nosode theory
      true, or are disease products homœopathically curative only in those cases resembling them,
      not having a disease product history? Let others answer, I am not able to as yet.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Since writing the above I have experimented more with the so-called nosodes
      and have had seemingly very good results from this remedy as well as <i><font color="#0000ff">Syphilinum</font></i>
      in intractable cases of chronic rheumatism. The most characteristic difference between them is
      that with <i><font color="#0000ff">Medorrhinum</font></i> the pains are worse in the <i><font color="#0000ff">day-time</font></i>, and with <i><font color="#0000ff">Syphilinum</font></i>
      in the <i><font color="#0000ff">night</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are, no doubt, great curative powers residing in these two disease
      poisons and they should not be discarded simply because they are the products of disease.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In regard to the other nosodes, I have, within two years past, seen more
      remarkable effects from them.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One case or retarded menstruation in a young girl who had greatly enlarged
      tonsils and who began to grow tired and weak, pale and short breathed on any exercise. The
      menses appeared twice under the action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, but
      at intervals of several months, and finally not at all. After the failure of several other
      remedies to give her any benefit, she took one dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i>
      1m. with prompt, easy and natural appearance of the menses and corresponding improvement in
      other respects, and is now attending school in apparent good health. I forgot to state that
      her sister, older, died of consumption a few years before.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Again, while on a visit to my daughter in Athens, Pa., I called upon one of
      the homœopathic physicians of the place, whom I had never met before. He had read
      "Leaders," and after we had talked books a while he asked me if I would not like to
      see a curious case, and there was no <i><font color="#0000ff">money</font></i> in it, but it
      had come into his hands from all allopaths who had given it up to die. Of course, there being
      no <i><font color="#0000ff">money</font></i> in it, I readily consented to go. Found a child
      of seven months with "head on him" larger than a man's head, with eyes pushed out
      and turned upwards, only movable a little from side to side. It looked idiotic. The
      fontanelles could not be felt, because of the hydrocephalic condition which filled the whole
      scalp, distending it as above described.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I could not see that that child recognized anything, except that its
      whining, moaning (almost constant) seemed to increase if it was spoken to or moved.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Inquiry into its family history discovered that several of the mother's
      sisters had died with tuberculosis. She was the only one left of the family, I think. I gave,
      with the doctor's consent, a powder of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i> 1m.
      and advised to let it act. This was on the Monday following Easter Sunday.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">May 24th, l900, I received the following letter:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Dr. E. B. Nash,</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Cortland, N. Y.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Dear Doctor: -You will doubtless remember the case of hydrocephalus
      you saw with me while in Athens, and for which you prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i>.
      Well, from that day, the head ceased to increase in size and (though it has taken no medicine
      at all, since taking that) has begun to gradually <i><font color="#0000ff">decrease</font></i>.
      They measure it in the same place every Sunday, and last Sunday it was half an inch smaller
      than a week before. Will you kindly send me a graft at once of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i>
      high, that I may continue the remedy at intervals, etc., etc."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I received one letter since, reporting further improvement. I can hardly
      expect a <i><font color="#0000ff">cure</font></i> in such a case, but the effects of the
      remedy, so far, seem to be quite remarkable. A case of lung trouble brought to me over a year
      ago from Seneca Falls, N. Y., had been under allopathic treatment for four years and had been
      every summer up in the Adirondacks at Saranac, at a Sanitarium established by Dr. Loomis of
      New York, lung specialist. She continued to grow worse until I took her case in hand. Under
      the action of two doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> c. m. followed by <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberc</font></i>. c. m. she is so improved that I think it would be hard to
      convince any one that she ever suffered from such conditions.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The trouble located in the upper left lung, where there was a distinct
      cavity, which as far as I can discover, is now healed, though there is a little dullness of
      respiratory murmur remaining.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One result of the action of these remedies was to restore a granular
      surface to the eyelids which had been cured (?) with local applications. I am sure that many
      incurable chronic diseases have had their beginning in just such tampering with local
      manifestations of <i><font color="#0000ff">Psora</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One more case. -L. D. G., a man sixty years of age, whose brothers and
      sisters had several of them died of consumption, had been troubled at times with a spasmodic
      gagging cough for twenty-five years. He was operated for a stricture of the urethra, and a few
      weeks after was attacked with chills resembling fever and ague. It was in the winter season,
      and chills and fever are not common here at any time of the year, unless imported. He had
      several of these chills daily, until there developed a strong <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus
      toxicod</font></i>., condition, when a dose of that remedy put an end to them. But here
      followed frequent attacks of great pain from the back all through the abdomen, especially the
      hypogastric region. When I would get these pains in the bowels relieved in a measure he would
      have what appeared to be neuralgic pains in different parts all over him, first in one place,
      then in another. When these would seem to subside, he would begin to cough more, and so the
      thing travelled from pillar to post, for months.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Sheldon, of Syracuse, man of large experience, was called in
      consultation. After careful examination, he decided, in view of the family history and (as he
      expressed it) a peculiar doughy feeling in the abdominal walls, that the case was tubercular
      in character, and advised <i><font color="#0000ff">Verat. album</font></i> at present, because
      the patient was so weak and reduced and cold, especially the extremities.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It was given, but with little or no effect, and things went on as usual
      until on his theory of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculosis</font></i> one evening I dropped
      a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i> upon his tongue. The effect was
      that he slept that night as quietly as if under the influence of an anodyne, and every symptom
      was alleviated, and he improved in every way for weeks until he was able to be out on the
      street every day. It was very cold weather and he caught cold and came down to the bed again.
      After a few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> for symptoms following his
      exposure, he received another dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i> as
      before, with similar effect, and in a short time he had so far improved as to be able to go on
      a visit to his friends in Troy, N. Y.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">How he will come out is still a question, but repeated effects of the
      remedy were so apparent in so grave a case that I have deemed them worthy of narration.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">If you turn to H. C. Allen's "Key-Notes of Leading Remedies,"
      page 297, you will find recorded: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Symptoms ever changing</font></i>,
      ailments affecting one organ, then another, the lungs, brain, kidneys, liver, stomach, nervous
      system -beginning suddenly, ceasing suddenly."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This seemed to be the case with this patient.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, I have seen apparent benefit follow the exhibition of this
      remedy in both incipient as well as advanced cases of Phthisis, always giving the high
      preparations in the latter and letting it act a long time without repetition. In view of what
      Dr. Burnett has written, and my own limited experience lately, I am confident that <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i> is destined to rank with <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>
      in the treatment of chronic diseases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I will add now, Dec. 17th, 1900, that the case of L. D. G. has continued to
      improve until he seems as well as he has during the last ten years and weighs more.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another case. -Maude Porter, age 27, unmarried; sanguine, nervous
      temperament; short, and stout when in health; blue eyes, brown hair.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Has had bad occasional epileptic fits for eleven years. Have been less
      frequent for past two years under the influence of a specialist's medicine that she got by
      letter from New York. Her mother had just died of tubercular consumption. Maude cared for her
      and was continually over her for the last month of her sickness.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">After her mother died, on May 28, 1900, she came to me bringing symptoms as
      follows:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Can't eat anything.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Mouth tastes very badly; in the morning &lt;.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Greatly depressed and cries easily.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Has had a cough since la grippe last December.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Has had a diarrhœa for past four weeks.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Pulse from 100 to 120 all the time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sweaty nights.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">On that date I prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
      200th and later 10m. with no perceptible change for the better.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">After <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> failed I prescribed
      for her <i><font color="#0000ff">Tuberculinum</font></i> 1m., and for the next four months she
      got about once in two weeks the same, once or twice changing to <i><font color="#0000ff">Bacillinum</font></i>
      200, under which treatment she made a perfect recovery, and is doing her usual housework,
      looking as well as ever at this date, December 17, 1900.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I believe that she would have gone with quick consumption but for this
      remedy. What do you think, my reader?</p>

      honest as was James B. Bell when he said of <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>
      -"Whether derived from purest gold or purest filth, our gratitude for its excellent
      services forbids us to enquire or care." As might be expected, <i><font color="#0000ff">Anthracinum</font></i>
      is more like this than any other remedy. In all cases simulating septic fever or poisoning <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum, Anthracinum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Pyrogen</font></i>
      should be remembered. The horrible <b><font color="#ff0000">burning pains</font></b> of the

      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have the 30th potency marked <i><font color="#0000ff">Chenopodium glauci</font></i>,
      with which I cured one case of pain under the left shoulder-blade. This case was of several
      years, standing, the pain at times becoming very severe. I have also used it in other cases
      with benefit. I always think of this remedy where I find such pain and of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> where it is under the right shoulder-blade. According
      to Dr. Jacob Jeanes, <i><font color="#0000ff">Chenopodium anthelminticum</font></i> cures a
      pain under the <i><font color="#0000ff">right</font></i> shoulder-blade similar to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>. The pain in both seems to depend upon some hepatic
      derangement. Having succeeded with the <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> so
      well, I have never used it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i> is well proven,
      and a full proving of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Chenopodium</font></i> may enable us to
      distinguish between them. Between the two <i><font color="#0000ff">Chenopodiums</font></i> and
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidonium</font></i>, we have an important trio for infra-scapular
      pains which ought to be better understood. Such single symptoms are, of course, small guides
      to follow, but are sometimes the only ones we have, and when, after full proving, the drug
      having them is developed, we often find that they were reliable though we could not at first
      give their pathological significance. I would, I think, as often follow such a guide, as
      speculations and theories. For instance, here are some such single symptoms which have often
      been verified. Inframammary pains at climacteric. <i><font color="#0000ff">Actæa racemosa</font></i>.
      Pain drawing through from nipple to back when child nurses, <i><font color="#0000ff">Croton

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Guernsey says. This remedy seems particularly useful in constitutionally
      delicate women who faint easily and want some kind of smelling salts around them most of the
      time. They are weak, with deficient reaction and generally of the lymphatic temperament. Such
      patients want stimulants, especially such stimulants as act through the olfactory nerves, like
      spirits of Ammonia, Camphor, Musk, Alcohol, etc. In the first onset of such a suddenly
      prostrating disease as cerebro-spinal meningitis this has been found a good remedy to excite
      reaction and place the patient in a condition for the choice of the next remedy indicated by
      the now aroused vital force in conflict with the disease (so called). One thing <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium carb</font></i>. is good for is dry or stuffed coryza, acute or
      chronic. The patient is worse at night, has to breathe with the mouth open. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sambucus, Lycopodium, Nux vomica</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta
      pulmonaria</font></i> may be compared with it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Another frequently verified symptom of the nose is epistaxis <i><font color="#0000ff">while flashing the face</font></i>. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Kali carbonicum</font></i>).
      I don't know why it comes on then, but it does, and this remedy cures it. The only other
      affection in which I have found it very useful is scarlatina. The body is very red, almost
      bluish-red, and the throat seems to be the center where the force of the disease seems to be
      expended in malignant intensity. The eruption is faintly developed, or has seemed to
      disappear, from sheer inability from weakness of the patient's vitality to keep it on the
      surface (<i><font color="#0000ff">Zinc</font></i>. has convulsions from the same cause).
      Erysipelas of old, debilitated persons comes under the same head. Cerebral symptoms,
      simulating a drunken stupor, are present in both cases. The whole system seems to be
      overpowered by the toxic effect of the disease poison. (See also <i><font color="#0000ff">Ailanthus</font></i>).
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium carb</font></i>. will sometimes help us out in such cases.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">One symptom of this remedy that has proved to be a valuable keynote for its
      administration is: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Sensation of coldness in the back, between
      the shoulders</font></i>." It is generally found in chest affections, such as cough or
      pains in the chest without cough. I have found it as reliable a keynote as is the <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> between the shoulders of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>. It is also a remedy for constipation, the
      stool being <i><font color="#0000ff">hard, dry and crumbling and also very difficult to expel</font></i>.
      Sometimes the stool is covered with mucus, something like <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>,
      which has stool covered with mucus, shining, as if greased. There is also a resemblance
      between these two remedies affecting the muscles and ligaments. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium
      mur</font></i>. has pain with a <i><font color="#0000ff">sensation</font></i> as if the
      muscles were contracted or too short, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i> goes
      a step further and has <i><font color="#0000ff">actual</font></i> contraction of these parts,
      producing what is known as arthritis deformans. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Cimex, Nat. m</font></i>.).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are two remedies that have menses, or flow of blood from the uterus, <i><font color="#0000ff">at night</font></i>. They are <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium mur</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i>, the other symptoms, of course, deciding the
      choice between them (Kreosot. <i><font color="#0000ff">menses flow only on lying down</font></i>,
      cease when sitting or walking about; <i><font color="#0000ff">Lilium tig. flows only when
      moving about</font></i>, ceased to flow when she ceased to walk; <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia
      carb. flows only at night or when lying</font></i>, ceases when walking). This remedy is also
      sometimes useful in sciatica. Here we have the sense of contraction in the tendons and the
      patient is worse while sitting, some better when walking and entirely relieved when lying
      down. It also has pains in the heels as if ulcerated. For pains in the heels see also <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca, Cyclamen, Manganum, Ledum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>.

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is one of our best remedies for vomiting in children. The milk comes up as
      soon as swallowed, by a great effort, after which the child becomes greatly relaxed and
      drowsy; or if the milk stays down longer it finally comes up in <i><font color="#0000ff">very
      sour curds, so large that it would seem almost impossible the child could have ejected them</font></i>.
      if this condition of the stomach is not cured the case will go on to cholera infantum, with
      green watery or slimy stool, colic and convulsions. The convulsions of this remedy are
      peculiar, in that the eyes <i><font color="#0000ff">turn downward</font></i> instead of up or
      sidewise. If the case still progresses unfavourably there is an appearance of sunkenness in
      the face with <i><font color="#0000ff">linea nasalis</font></i>, which is a surface of pearly
      whiteness on the upper lip, bounded by a distinct line from the outer nasal orifice to the
      angles of the mouth.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This last symptom is more characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Æthusa
      than any other remedy. Æthusa</font></i> has complete absence of thirst. The <i><font color="#0000ff">prostration and anxiety</font></i> are very marked, but the absence of thirst
      rules for <i><font color="#0000ff">Æthusa</font></i> instead of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum
      album</font></i>. Vomiting of large curds (sour) is also found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea
      ostrearum</font></i>, but with this remedy we have at the same time sour stools, and then
      sweaty head, and open fontanelles as well as <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>
      temperament would generally be found in the case.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There is another very peculiar symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Æthusa</font></i>
      that has been cured twice to my knowledge by this remedy, viz.: Imagined she saw a rat or
      mouse run across the room. In both these cases the symptom occurred in hard worked, nervous
      women, but the symptom was very persistent and annoying. <i><font color="#0000ff">Æthusa</font></i>
      not only cured the aberration but improved the general health. I always use it in the 200th

      from bad to worse, until it was reduced almost to a skeleton. Instead of screaming all night
      it screamed day and night, all the time (so the mother said), and certain it was, it was
      always screaming when I saw it. With the screaming there were constant contortions of the
      body, bending forward, backward and sidewise alternately. I cannot tell how many different
      remedies I tried, but finally, in the course of human events, l gave it some <i><font color="#0000ff">Jalapa</font></i>, 12th, run up from some of the crude drug which I procured
      from an ordinary drug store. The child went to sleep, and from that nap, which was a good,

      useful in colicky diarrhœa of children. There is another very characteristic symptom, viz.,:
      "Not only the stools are sour; <i><font color="#0000ff">the whole child smells sour</font></i>,
      no matter how much it is bathed." In colic and diarrhœa during dentition a choice will

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy has not been thoroughly proven, but enough has been learned
      from what we have, and clinical experience, to indicate that it is a very valuable one. As a

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This comparison is carried far enough to show that a choice between these
      remedies is not generally difficult. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Collinsonia</font></i> I
      once cured a very severe colic which had been of frequent occurrence in a lady for several
      years and had completely baffled the old school efforts to cure. I was led to choose the
      remedy on account of the obstinate constipation, the great flatulence and the hæmorrhoidal
      condition present.</p>
      <p align="justify">I also cured one of the most obstinate cases of chronic constipation I ever
      met. The patient for two years had only averaged a movement of the bowels once in two weeks,
      and then only under the action of powerful cathartics, after which he would be almost sick two
      or three days in bed. <i><font color="#0000ff">Collinsonia</font></i> cured him within a month
      so perfectly that his bowels moved naturally every day and the trouble never returned so long
      as I knew him, for years afterwards.</p>
