      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is useful for spasmodic cough, like whooping cough. It is continual, short,
      hawking through the day, so constant and frequent as to have merited the description given it
      of "<i><font color="#0000ff">Minute gun</font></i>" cough. This is during the day
      and there is not much whooping, but at night there is more whooping. The night paroxysms are
      sometimes very severe.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have found <i><font color="#0000ff">Coral</font></i>. one of the very
      best remedies for post nasal catarrh, with <i><font color="#0000ff">mutch dropping of mucus</font></i>
      into the throat. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum carb</font></i>.) I do not know any other
      remedy so efficacious in the majority of cases, and generally prescribe it, unless I have
      strong indications for some other remedy. I seldom fail to hear a good report from it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Coral</font></i>. has also been found useful in <i><font color="#0000ff">chancre</font></i>.
      The ulcer is red (coral red), flat and exceedingly sensitive, sometimes painful. Chancroids or
      soft chancre, for which the old school cauterize, may find a swift and sure cure in <i><font color="#0000ff">Coral</font></i>.</p>

      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a good remedy for gonorrhœa when there are on account of slow or
      intermittent flow of urine indications of formation of a stricture, and will, if given early
      (high), often prevent it So much pain and suffering often necessitating operation for the
      relief of stricture has been experienced that everything possible should be done to avert it.
      In the first place the cauterization method, or fashionable local treatment, is responsible
      for nearly, if not quite, all strictures. I know that such practice is neither scientific nor
      curative in the remotest sense, and on the other hand I know that constitutional treatment
      alone is adequate to cure (not simply suppress) the worst cases, and that in the shortest
      possible time. Another use for <i><font color="#0000ff">Clematis</font></i> is for curing the
      orchitis arising from the suppression of gonorrhœa, or when it may have extended to the
      testicles without such suppression, which latter condition seldom occurs. The testicle becomes
      greatly swollen, and if not promptly relieved becomes indurated and hard as a stone. I have
      cured this very promptly with <i><font color="#0000ff">Clematis. Pulsatilla</font></i> is
      undoubtedly the remedy oftenest indicated in orchitis from suppressed gonorrhœa, but if after
      it has reduced the pain and restored the discharge it fails to reduce the swelling or
      induration, <i><font color="#0000ff">Clematis</font></i> will do the rest. It has not
      disappointed me. <i><font color="#0000ff">Clematis</font></i> has a symptom similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Coffea</font></i>, viz., "Toothache relieved by holding cold water in the
      mouth."</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy acts strongly upon mucous membranes. It has, like many other
      remedies, been so abused by the old school that it has fallen into disrepute, and the tendency
      even with our own school under such circumstances is to underrate its virtues or to fail to
      investigate as they ought to. It is, however, an excellent remedy in the form of chronic
      bronchial catarrh, with profuse expectoration of greenish or gray purulent matter. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Stannum, Lycopodium, Sulphur, Phosphorus</font></i>, etc.) Among remedies not
      yet well understood we have:</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Copaiva</font></i>, profuse greenish-gray, disgusting smelling sputa.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">I mention these remedies in order to call attention to them for trial in
      case we cannot find the curative among the better proven ones. All the old remedies had to
      have their <i><font color="#0000ff">beginnings</font></i>.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Copaiva</font></i> is a valuable remedy in gonorrhœa. There is great
      irritation in the urethra and at the neck of the bladder. It may be indicated in the
      beginning, when the discharge is thin or milky, and later, especially when the disease has
      extended to the bladder, with discharge of a large amount of viscid mucus or blood and mucus
      in the urine. Although not so violent in its action on the urinary tract as <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i>, it stands very close to it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="CUBEBA"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">CUBEBA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This remedy, also fallen into disrepute from its empirical use in the old
      school, has an important place in the therapeutics of gonorrhœa, if after the first or
      inflammatory stage is passed under the usual remedies for that stage there still remains
      burning in the urethra after urination and the discharge remains thick, yellow or puslike.
      Notwithstanding <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>,
      we may find our remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Cubeba</font></i>. I have made some fine
      cures myself in such cases. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> the discharge,
      while thick, or yellow, or green, is more likely to be <i><font color="#0000ff">bland</font></i>,
      as it is on mucous membranes elsewhere. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercury</font></i> has a
      similar discharge, but all the symptoms are <i><font color="#0000ff">worse at night</font></i>.
      When the discharge becomes thin (gleety) neither of these remedies are, appropriate.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Right here let us call attention to another remedy which ought to be
      mentioned in connection with the treatment of gonorrhœa.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="PETROSELINUM"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">PETROSELINUM.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has a very characteristic indication for its administration, viz.:
      "Great and <b><font color="#ff0000">sudden</font></b> desire to urinate," children
      stand and jump right up and down from pain and urging. This is mostly found in chronic cases
      (especially after gonorrhœa) after the inflammation has extended backward to the neck of the
      bladder. Another very troublesome symptom found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Petroselinum</font></i>
      is <b><font color="#ff0000">itching</font></b> in the urethra; feels as if he must run a stick
      or something in there and <i><font color="#0000ff">scratch</font></i> it. Burning, tingling,
      from perinæum throughout whole urethra. Children are sometimes troubled with such sudden and
      intense desire to urinate that they will jump right up and down, trying to hold on until their
      clothes are unbuttoned. It is like the sudden desire for stool of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloe</font></i>
      -"<i><font color="#0000ff">must git thar</font></i>."</p>

      reverse).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Cold extends to the bronchi, with profuse secretion of mucus; coughing and
      much rattling (<i><font color="#0000ff">Chelidon</font></i>).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Modalities &lt; in the evening, and in warm room, &gt; in open air (the
      coryza).</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Anyone who has cut up raw onions for coming knows what is the effect upon
      the eyes and nose -irritation, which causes violent sneezing and lachrymation. Then, if the
      homœopathic law of cure is true, it ought to be a good remedy for coryza, and so it is; but
      like every other remedy, it cures its own peculiar and characteristic form of the disease.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">It has constant and frequent sneezing, with profuse acrid discharge, which
      burns and corrodes the nose and upper lip, and it is worse in the evening and indoors and
      better in open air</font></i>. It has also profuse lachrymation, with burning, biting and
      smarting of the eyes, but the discharge is bland; that is, it does not make the eyes sore
      afterwards. There may or may not be headache; if there is it is, like the coryza, worse in
      warm room or evening and better in open air. I have found it particularly useful in children
      when the profuse coryza or cold extended downward to the bronchi, with a like profuse
      secretion in the bronchial tubes, with much coughing and rattling of mucus. Before <i><font color="#0000ff">Cepa</font></i> came into homœopathic use we used to give <i><font color="#0000ff">Euphrasia</font></i> when there was profuse coryza and lachrymation. The
      difference between the two remedies is, that with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cepa</font></i> the
      nasal discharge is acrid and the lachrymal bland, while exactly the reverse is true of <i><font color="#0000ff">Euphrasia</font></i>. The action of the remedy seems to be primarily in the
      nose with the one and in the eyes with the other, and thus we must learn to differentiate
      between all remedies.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="EUPHRASIA"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

      <p align="CENTER">EUPHRASIA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The action of this remedy seems to <i><font color="#0000ff">center</font></i>
      in the eyes. If you read the symptoms as laid down in "Hering's Guiding Symptoms,"
      you would think that it would cure almost all possible affections of the eyes, acute or
      chronic conjunctivitis, iritis, kerato-iritis, spots, vesicles, pannus, etc., and so it will
      if indicated by the symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In colds with cough and severe fluent coryza it will sometimes cure, but
      here the choice must be made between it and <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum, Cepa</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Cepa</font></i>
      for comparison).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">In measles with watery eyes and fluent coryza it is sometimes the best
      remedy. I remember Dr. C. W. Boyce, of Auburn, N. Y., reporting great success with it in an
      epidemic in that city.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">He cured all his cases with it. So I went for the next epidemic in my
      vicinity with <i><font color="#0000ff">Euphrasia</font></i>, and my failure was as marked as
      his success. It was <i><font color="#0000ff">not</font></i> the remedy for <i><font color="#0000ff">my</font></i> epidemic. But I know enough not to "go it blind" that
      way very long, and hunted up my simillimum. Then I succeeded, too. Look out, young man, for
      the remedy that is recommended for <i><font color="#0000ff">all cases</font></i> of any
      disease, or you'll "come down hard" some time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One very prominent characteristic in eye troubles for this remedy is a <i><font color="#0000ff">tendency to an accumulation of sticky mucus</font></i> on the cornea, which is
      removed by winking. All cases of any kind attended with photophobia and lachrymation, with or
      without coryza, should suggest this remedy, or at least call it to mind. In the eye affections
      of <i><font color="#0000ff">Euphrasia</font></i> the lids are often involved. Of course this
      is so with other remedies, such as <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum, Apis, Rhus toxic</font></i>.,
      etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Study up</font></i>. one more symptom: Cough, sometimes dry, but
      generally loose, <i><font color="#0000ff">worse during the day</font></i>, not troublesome at
      night. This is important, as more coughs are &lt; at night.</p>

      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca decandra</font></i> is one of our most valuable remedies for
      sore throat, and the indications are plain. The throat becomes generally inflamed; the tonsils
      swell and become very red at the first, and then white spots appear which (unless checked)
      soon spread and coalesce and form patches of a diphtheritic appearance. <i><font color="#0000ff">There are sharks pains often running up into one or both ears</font></i>.
      These are the local throat symptoms, and the constitutional symptoms are:</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Intense head and backache, and a sore, aching, bruised feeling all over the
      body, causing the patient to groan, and while, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus
      toxicodendron</font></i>, he feels as if he <i><font color="#0000ff">must move</font></i>, the
      act of moving greatly aggravates all his pains and soreness. The patient is also greatly
      prostrated, and sitting upright makes him faint and dizzy like <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>.
      There is high fever, for the pulse is very quick; but the heat, like that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i>, is mostly in the head and face while the body and limbs are
      cool.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now these symptoms present, it makes no difference whether the case is
      called tonsilitis, diphtheria or scarlatina. Abundant experience in my own person and
      observation with my patients has proven <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> to be a
      remedy of inestimable value. Nor is it necessary to give it in twenty drop doses of the mother
      tincture, and gargle in addition, as some advise, but it will in the potentized dose do much
      better, the same as other homœopathic remedies. I have done some good work with this remedy
      in follicular pharyngitis, especially when in public speakers the voice gave out from
      over-work and there was much <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i> in the throat, as of
      a hot substance there. In this kind of sore throat I have the best success with the remedy
      very high.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Now let me call attention to a symptom of this remedy that has been of
      great value to me: "Irresistible inclination to bite the teeth or gums together." On
      this indication I have often relieved the complaints of various kinds incident to the period
      of dentition. I once had a case that was sent up to the country from New York City. The child
      had been sick a long time, with cholera infantum (entero-colitis), and its physicians said it
      must leave the city or die. But country air and change of diet brought no relief. The little
      fellow was greatly emaciated, having frequent loose stools of dark brown color, mixed with
      slime or mucus of the same color. After trying various remedies I discovered that the child
      wanted to bite its gums together, or to bite on everything that it could get into its mouth,
      and the mother then told me that this had been the case all through its sickness. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> produced immediate relief of the symptoms and rapid
      recovery followed.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have since verified this symptom several times. <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>
      is also one of our best remedies for mastitis. The breasts are very hard, greatly swollen, hot
      and painful. When the child nurses the pain <i><font color="#0000ff">radiates all over the
      body</font></i>. There is fever, great pain in the head and back, and if it is a bad case,
      unless checked, is very liable to go on to suppuration. Every time the child nurses the pains
      spread all over the body.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The choice often lies between this remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>,
      and they complement each other. Almost every case of swollen breasts with the milk fever, when
      the breasts fill for the first time after confinement, may be speedily relieved with one or
      the other of these two remedies. If the case should have gone on to suppuration, with large
      fistulous, gaping and angry ulcers discharging a watery or fœtid pus, Phytolacca is still the
      remedy; and will often do more good than <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar sulphur</font></i>.
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Silicea</font></i>. But the choice sometimes has to be made
      between other remedies such as:</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Croton tiglium</font></i>. The pain runs through to the back when child
      nurses. (<b><font color="#ff0000">Silicea</font></b>, <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>).</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Phellandrium</font></i>. Pain runs along the milk ducts <i><font color="#0000ff">between</font></i> the acts of nursing.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Lac caninum</font></i>. The breasts are greatly filled and so <i><font color="#0000ff">sore</font></i> that their own weight hurts the patient, who wants to <i><font color="#0000ff">hold them up</font></i> and shrinks from the <i><font color="#0000ff">least
      jar</font></i>. Of course <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite, Apis</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> must not be forgotten, and have as positive indications
      for their use as any of the above remedies. (See also <i><font color="#0000ff">Castor equorum</font></i>.)</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I have removed a great many suspicious lumps or tumors in the breasts, some
      of them of years' standing, by giving a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>
      c. m., once a month, <i><font color="#0000ff">during the wane of the moon</font></i>. What has
      the moon to do with it? I do not know. I cure goître the same way (but not with <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>), and was led to that way of administration by a
      suggestion of Jahr. That some diseases have their aggravations in certain times of the moon I <i><font color="#0000ff">know</font></i>, and that certain remedies act better then, I know just as
      well. Do not forget that the bruised, sore feeling of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>
      that we noticed at length when writing of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arnica</font></i> is
      sometimes markedly present in sciatica, for which it is one of our successful remedies. The
      characteristic symptom for <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> in this painful
      affection is, that the pain <i><font color="#0000ff">runs</font></i> down the <i><font color="#0000ff">outer side of the limb</font></i>. Sciatica is one of the complaints in which <i><font color="#0000ff">Homœopathy</font></i> has scored some of its most brilliant victories over
      the anodyne treatment of the old school. Periosteal rheumatism, where the pains are especially
      worse in wet weather, sometimes finds a remedy in <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>.
      This drug seems to resemble in its action on the periosteum, glands, bones and skin <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali hydroiodicum</font></i>, and the two remedies complement each other, of
      course, with indications, or the choice may sometimes lie between them. H. C. Allen says: <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i> occupies a place midway between <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>., and will often help when these seem
      indicated but fail. It is curious to note that almost every chemical remedy has a closely

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Sudden local congestion, especially to head and chest; bursting headache
      rising up from neck, with great throbbing and sense of expansion as if to burst; cannot bear
      the least jar.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Over-heating in the sun, or sunstroke.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This is, in the first place, one of our great head remedies. It has intense
      pain in the head, with great throbbing and sensation of fullness and constriction of the
      vessels of the neck. There are so many symptoms attending this condition of congestion that it
      is not wise to try to give them all here. I used, in my early practice, to carry a small vial
      of the 1st dilution in my case on purpose for those who were inclined to sneer at the young
      doctor and his sweet medicine, and many a disbeliever have I convinced, in about five or ten
      minutes, that there might be power in small doses of sweet medicine, by dropping on the tongue
      a drop of this preparation, for it seldom failed to produce its characteristic throbbing
      headache within that time. One lady, not willing to acknowledge that it affected her, rose to
      leave the room, and fainted and would have fallen to the floor if I had not caught her. No one
      ever asked after that experiment for any more proof of the power of homœopathic medicine.
      This throbbing headache, <i><font color="#0000ff">seeming to arise from the neck</font></i>,
      is very characteristic, and the throbbing is not a mere sensation but is visible in the
      carotid arteries. The vessels are full to bursting, and if their walls were not healthy there
      is danger of apoplexy. No remedy equals this one for producing sudden and severe congestion of
      the head, and none can cure it quicker when indicated by the symptoms. The remedies that stand
      nearest <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> in their effect on the head I believe to
      be <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Melilotus</font></i>.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>
      both have the fullness, pain and throbbing, but that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>
      is more intense and sudden in its onset, and, on the other hand, subsides more rapidly when
      relieved. Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> is better adapted to the first
      or congestive stage of inflammatory diseases of the brain, while <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      goes further and may still be the appropriate remedy after the inflammatory stage is fully
      initiated. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> is better by bending the head
      backward; <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> worse. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      is made worse by having the head uncovered, and suffers from having the hair cut; <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine must have</font></i> the head uncovered, can't bear to wear his hat,
      or wants the hair cut. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> is <i><font color="#0000ff">worse lying</font></i> down, even if he keeps still; <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>,
      though sometimes worse <i><font color="#0000ff">after</font></i> lying down, is also sometimes
      <i><font color="#0000ff">better</font></i> when <i><font color="#0000ff">lying still</font></i>.
      One symptom <i><font color="#0000ff">very</font></i> characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">of
      Glonoine</font></i> is, that the patient carries the head very carefully, for the <b><font color="#ff0000">least jar</font></b> or shaking of it greatly aggravates the pain. Another
      peculiar symptom is, it seems to the patient that there is not only throbbing, but there is an
      undulating sensation as if the brain were <i><font color="#0000ff">moving in waves</font></i>
      synchronous with the pulse. There is more disturbance of the heart action with <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> than with <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>,
      though both have it strongly. <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> has a <i><font color="#0000ff">sensation</font></i> of rush of blood to the heart or chest.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Melilotus</font></i> also has great congestion to the head, with pain and
      sense of fullness. Not being so thoroughly proven as <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>, we cannot so clearly indicate the exact
      place for it, but there is one very prominent symptom which always makes one think of it,
      viz.: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Glowing redness of the face</font></i>." No remedy
      that I know of has it more strongly. <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> may both have very red face; on the other hand, a pale
      face, with the other congestive symptoms, does not contraindicate them, but does <i><font color="#0000ff">Melilotus</font></i>. Then, again, with <i><font color="#0000ff">Melilotus</font></i>
      the head symptoms are often relieved by a profuse epistaxis, which is also another very
      prominent symptom of this remedy. I cured a very bad case of typhus cerebralis, and also a
      case of insanity of long standing, with this remedy, being guided to it by these symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Loses his way in well-known streets" is a symptom of <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> that has several times been confirmed. The local
      congestions of <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> are often found in different
      diseases; for instance, climacteric flushings are often most felt in the head. <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i> cures such cases. It is also useful in puerperal
      convulsions. And another symptom often present in these cases is, a sense as if the head were
      expanding from fullness. Now look out for convulsions and give <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>,
      especially if there be albumen in the urine. Congestion to the head from suppressed or
      retarded menses sometimes finds a remedy here; also, different pathological conditions of the
      heart, but the <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i> must be present.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">For sunstroke it is probably oftener indicated than any other remedy; also
      for the after-sufferings therefrom. Not only from sunstroke, but from other bad effects of <i><font color="#0000ff">radiate heat</font></i>; for instance, children get sick in the night after
      sitting too long or falling asleep before an open coal fire.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Then, again, warm room increases the headache and warm bed the faceache.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Burning between the shoulders" is another symptom of this
      remedy, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>.
      <i><font color="#0000ff">Ammonium muriaticum</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachnanthes</font></i>
      have the opposite. While we are here now I will call attention to another remedy, which, for
      flushings and congestions to head and face, resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>,
      that is, <i><font color="#0000ff">Amyl. nit</font></i>.</p>

      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here is a remedy of undoubted great value. The best rendering of it is
      given by Dr. H. C. Allen in the transactions of the I. H. A., page 104, year 1887, although a
      very fair one is found in the "Guiding Symptoms" (Hering). The provers all had
      fearful headaches and hæmorrhages except myself (Bowen).</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">The congestion to the brain is equal to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i>
      and <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>, and the most characteristic symptom of such
      congestion is <i><font color="#0000ff">intense redness of the face, with throbbing carotids</font></i>,
      which is often &gt; by a <i><font color="#0000ff">profuse epistaxis</font></i>. Several years
      ago I cured a very bad case of mania of the religious form with the 6th potency. This lady had
      had one similar attack a few years before, when, after she had been given up by two allopaths,
      who said she must go to the asylum, I relieved her with <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>.
      She was <i><font color="#0000ff">very loquacious</font></i> at that time.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">This time <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i> failed, but no
      indication of the <i><font color="#0000ff">intensely red face</font></i> I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Melilotus</font></i> with a rapid and permanent cure. The first cause of these
      attacks was <i><font color="#0000ff">overheating</font></i> in the sun.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">One more case will illustrate the action of this truly great remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">During a run of typhoid fever in a young lady she had frequent attacks of
      profuse epistaxis. One attack followed another, sometimes twice or three times in twenty-four
      hours, until I became alarmed on account of the great loss of blood.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">She had been subject to frequent attacks of nosebleed since childhood, from
      the time she was injured in the nasal passage by a button she pushed up the nose, and which a
      "regular" claimed, after much violence, to have pushed down her throat, but which in
      reality remained in her nose a long time -several months- when it was ejected in a fit of
      coughing and sneezing. Two years before I carried her through a very severe attack of
      diphtheria, which was also attended by severe nosebleed, occurring at night, the blood <i><font color="#0000ff">hanging in clots</font></i> from the nose like icicles.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius sol</font></i>. 30th then stopped it very nicely. Now the blood
      clotted some, but not so markedly. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i> did no good.
      Every attack has preceded by the most <i><font color="#0000ff">intense redness and flushing</font></i>
      of the face and throbbing of the carotids I ever witnessed. The nosebleed would invariably
      follow within a few hours this apparent rush of blood to head and face. <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna did no good</font></i>. Neither did <i><font color="#0000ff">Erigeron</font></i>,
      which, in Hering, "has congestion of the head, red face, nosebleed and febrile
      action."</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Melilotus 30th relieved promptly not only these attacks of congestion to
      head and nosebleed, but the whole case afterward progressed without an untoward symptom to
      perfect recovery.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">F. A. Waddell, M. D., reports a case of pneumonic congestion, in which the
      characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">red face and epistaxis</font></i> were present, as
      cured with this remedy.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Dr. Bowen, to whom belongs the credit of first introducing this remedy to
      the profession, reports many cases of headaches, colic, cramps in the stomach and spasms
      relieved and cured by it. It seems to me that this remedy should be classed with <i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>, and
      never forgotten in comparison with remedies having strong head symptoms.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has quite a reputation for arresting paroxysms of epilepsy and
      resuscitating patients sinking under <i><font color="#0000ff">anæsthetics</font></i>. It is
      given here by olfaction. There are various speculations as to how it does this; the most
      important thing, after all, is that it does it.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">We know that it causes and cures tumultuous heart action very similar in
      appearance to that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Glonoine</font></i>. I have cured a very bad
      case of chronic blushing or flushing of blood to the face on the least excitement, either
      mental or physical. It was in a young married woman, not near the climacteric, and she had
      suffered very much for a long time. The cure is permanent and the patient is very grateful,
      for, as she said, she supposed it was natural and medicine could not help it. Those who <i><font color="#0000ff">cannot blush</font></i> don't need it. This is all the experience I have had
      with this remedy and I always used it in the 30th.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">KALI BROMATUM.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">I do not know much about this remedy from a homœopathic standpoint. It
      first gained a reputation with the old school profession for its sleep-producing qualities and
      its power over epileptic seizures. As usual, it was pushed for these things until they found
      it was a dangerous remedy in the large doses which they had to use to produce the desired
      effect.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">They discovered that it produced sleep, not by increasing the blood in the
      brain to stupefaction, like <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>, but, by decreasing the
      amount of blood, thus resembling more nearly natural sleep. Then they exclaimed, Eureka! But,
      alas! too great and long-continued <i><font color="#0000ff">anæmia</font></i> resulted in
      lack of nutriment to the brain tissue, and as a consequence there developed depression,
      melancholia, insanity and signs of brain softening until Hammond, its chief advocate, admitted
      that it put more patients into the insane asylum than any other remedy.</p>
      <p align="justify">Well, for what can we safely use the remedy? For the symptoms arising from
      cases simulating the effects of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bromatum</font></i>, just as we
      do any other homœopathic remedy. I do not understand the remedy well enough to give
      characteristic indications for its homœopathic uses. There is one symptom which I think is
      valuable as a "guiding symptom," viz.: "fidgety hands." The patient must
      be working or playing with them continually; even the sleeplessness is somewhat relieved by
      moving the fingers over the bed clothes; or he plays with his watch chain or the head of his
      cane, anything to work off this excess of nervousness. <i><font color="#0000ff">Zincum</font></i>
      has "fidgety feet," and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> a general
      fidgetiness of uneasiness; can't sit still, but changes position continually; not like <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus toxicodendron</font></i>, because he is relieved of pain by moving, but
      because he is simply <i><font color="#0000ff">nervous</font></i>. The homœopathic uses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bromatum</font></i> ought to be better understood.</p>
