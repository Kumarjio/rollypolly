      <p align="JUSTIFY">Here are five so-called hysterical remedies. They have many nervous
      symptoms that are similar, and I will only give a few characteristic symptoms of each and
      leave their study to those who love to study.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      <p align="JUSTIFY">These five remedies should be studied together.</p>
      </font></i><b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Moschus</font></b>. "Hysterical spasms of the chest, nervous
      suffocative constrictions, especially on becoming cold." Palpitation (hysteric) with
      dyspnœa, prostration, fainting, exclaiming, "I shall die! I shall die!" etc.,
      greatly excited. Laughs immoderately, or cries or scolds until her lips turn blue, eyes stare
      and she falls down fainting or unconscious.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Castoreum</font></b>. "Exhausted pains better from pressure, menstrual
      colic, with pallor and cold sweat."</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Asafœtida</font></b>. Enormous accumulation of flatulence all pressing
      upward; ball rising in throat.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Great suffering, especially hysterical, from suppression of discharges.
      Discharges fœtid.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Great sensitiveness to contact; in ulcers, especially periosteal.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">"Full of wind; flatulence with eructations all <i><font color="#0000ff">pressing upward</font></i>, but none downward. Seems as if she would burst
      with the upward pressure, reverse peristalsis." "Especially useful if its nervous
      symptoms come on after the suppression of leucorrhœal or other habitual discharges." All
      discharges offensive, even of ulcers, and great sensitiveness to contact or touch. Osteitis or
      caries with this same exceeding sensitiveness to contact (<i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar</font></i>).</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Valerian</font></b>. General nervous irritation, cannot keep still, tearing
      pains and cramps in different places. Feels as if <i><font color="#0000ff">floating in the air</font></i>
      (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sticta pulm</font></i>. as if legs were floating in the air).
      Over-sensitiveness of all the senses. Sensation as of a thread hanging down throat. With this
      remedy I once cured a severe case of sciatica in a pregnant woman on the symptom, pain worse
      when standing and letting the foot rest on the floor. She could stand with that foot resting
      on a chair, or could lie down in comfort.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Ambra grisea</font></b>. Convulsive cough, with frequent eructations of
      gas.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Discharge of blood between the periods; after a hard stool; or walk.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Very nervous women, cannot void stool or urinate when others are in the
      room.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Discharge of blood between periods</font></i>; any little exertion or
      straining at stool causes it. Nervous cough followed by eructations of wind. It is
      particularly adapted to nervous affections of old people and spare subjects nervously
      "worn out."</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">A lady with dropsy, consequent on valvular heart disease, after being
      relieved of the bloating, was suddenly unable to talk. In answer to a question she could begin
      a sentence, but could not finish it, because she could not remember what she intended to say.
      She was very impatient about it and would cry, but could not finish the sentence, but could
      signify her assent if it was finished by some one else for her. This continued for several
      days, or until she received <i><font color="#0000ff">Cannabis Indica</font></i>, when she
      rapidly recovered her power to express herself. This is all the experience I have had with
      this remedy that is worth relating.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="AGARICUS"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Ears, face, nose and skin in general, red and itch as if from <i><font color="#0000ff">chilblains</font></i>.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Twitching in eyelids (especially), face, extremities, even choreaic
      jerkings, which cease during sleep.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Spinal column painful and sensitive to touch, aching extending into the
      lower limbs.</p>
      <p align="CENTER">* * * * *</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Agaricus has some very characteristic skin symptoms. "<i><font color="#0000ff">Ears, face, nose, toes and skin in general are affected with a redness,
      itching and burning as of from being frozen</font></i>." This is a very valuable symptom
      and may lead to the choice of this drug in many very different diseases. I have used the
      remedy a good many years with very gratifying results for <i><font color="#0000ff">chilblains</font></i>.
      I always use it internally in the 200th. It is also a remedy of first importance for <i><font color="#0000ff">twitchings</font></i>, from simple twitching <i><font color="#0000ff">in face,
      eyelids</font></i> (especially) and <i><font color="#0000ff">extremities, to severe cases of
      chorea</font></i>. In the latter disease the twitchings cease during sleep. Again it has been
      found useful in spinal irritation. The symptoms indicating it here are best given in Allen's <i><font color="#0000ff">Encyclopædia</font></i>. No doubt this remedy has been over proven, and as a
      consequence many of its recorded symptoms are unreliable. The best work that can be done with
      it now is to separate them, if possible, "proving all things and holding fast that which
      is true."</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Chronic rheumatism connected with valvular heart troubles should call our
      attention to this remedy, for it has done good service in such cases. Symptoms: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Rheumatic soreness in the cardiac region." "Violent pains in the
      heart when bending over." "Pains in heart when urinating or at menstrual
      period." "Flattering of the heart with mental agitation</font></i>," are all
      valuable guides to its selection. Then if we have the rheumatic symptoms, swelling and redness
      with great tenderness of the small joints, the indications are very positive for its use.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">There are often heavy <i><font color="#0000ff">deposits in the urine of
      mucus</font></i>, uric acid or pus. I have done some excellent work with it in such cases.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="SAMBUCUS_NIGRA"></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
      <b><font size="4" color="#ff0000">
      <p align="CENTER">SAMBUCUS NIGRA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is a prime remedy for "<i><font color="#0000ff">snuffles</font></i>"
      in small children. It is of the dry variety, completely obstructing the nose, child must
      breathe through the mouth. It is also one of the best remedies for asthma millari. The attacks
      come on suddenly in the night; <i><font color="#0000ff">child turns blue, gasps for breath</font></i>
      and seems as if almost dying. Then it goes to sleep and wakens with another attack again and
      again. I once relieved a very bad case of chronic asthma in an old lady having similar attacks
      of suffocation with the 200th of this remedy. The relief was followed, or rather accompanied,
      by a profuse flow of urine which carried off a large amount of dropsical effusion in her legs
      and abdomen. She has remained much better of all her symptoms since and is now <i><font color="#0000ff">very</font></i> old. One very peculiar characteristic which should never be
      forgotten is "<i><font color="#0000ff">dry heat</font></i>" while asleep and "<i><font color="#0000ff">profuse sweet when awake</font></i>." No other remedy has it, and it has
      been confirmed many times. <i><font color="#0000ff">Conium</font></i> has "sweats as soon
      as he closes his eyes to sleep." <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> has sweats on
      uncovered parts. (<i><font color="#0000ff">Belladonna</font></i> on covered.) <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>, one sided sweats and many of our best characteristics
      are found under the so-called fever symptoms, including chill, heat and sweat, and as we are
      apt to have one or the other, or all of these three conditions in most diseases, it is well,
      to have a ready understanding of them. It will save much time sometimes in hunting after the
      simillimum.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">SQUILLA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Has been found useful in cough, with sneezing; watering of the eyes, and
      involuntary micturition. There may also be pleuritic stitches in the chest, with or without
      effusion. The cough is generally loose and rattling, with expectoration of such mucus, and the
      loose cough in the morning is more fatiguing than the dry one in the evening.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Verbascum thapsus</font></b>. Cough, deep, hollow, hoarse, with sound like
      a trumpet. I have cured many cases and always used it low. I have never used the remedy for
      anything else.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Senega</font></b>. Cough with great accumulation of mucus, which seems to
      fill the chest, with much rattling, wheezing and difficult breathing; especially valuable with
      old people, but works well with others. Have also cured many cases of this kind and always use
      it low; no success with the high.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Illustrations</font></i>. -Several years ago I was called to an old
      asthmatic, who was having a terrible paroxysm. After several days of intense suffering, which
      ordinary remedies did not relieve in the least, I gave him <i><font color="#0000ff">Senega</font></i>
      three or four drops of tincture in one-half glass cold water, dessertspoonful doses once in
      two hours until relieved, with a promise to call again in the evening. Imagine my surprise
      when I called as he ushered me in with a smile and bow, for he was perfectly free from hard
      breathing and cough, and remained so for a long time after.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">During September, 1900, I was called again to a lady 50 years of age,
      suffering the same way. She had been suffering for over a month, at times very severely, but
      this paroxysm was worst of all. The dyspnœa was very great; had to sit propped up in bed;
      chest rattling and wheezing; filled with mucus which she could not raise; face and hands
      purple from unoxygenized blood. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac., Arsenic</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tart</font></i>. were of no benefit. One evening after their
      failure I dropped seven drops of the tincture of <i><font color="#0000ff">Senega</font></i>
      into one-half glass water, with directions to give teaspoonful once an hour until relieved,
      then at longer intervals. The next A. M. as soon as she saw me exclaimed, "Oh, Doctor, I
      wish you could just realize how I slept. In one-half hour after the first dose I went right to
      sleep, and I have had a beautiful night." I give these two cases to impress the value of
      this remedy upon the reader. I have used it many years in obstinate coughs with dyspnœa and
      difficult expectoration of mucus which seemed to fill the bronchial tubes.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Myrtus communis</font></b>. Obstinate cough, mostly dry, with <i><font color="#0000ff">pain in upper portion of left chest, right through to left shoulder-blade</font></i>.
      this is a gem and has, I believe, cured more than one case of incipient consumption for me. <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur, Pix liquida, Anisum, Arum tri</font></i>., and <i><font color="#0000ff">Theridion</font></i> have a similar symptom, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Myrtus</font></i>
      leads, unless there is decided psoric taint, when <i><font color="#0000ff">Pix liquida</font></i>
      or <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> would lead.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Drosera rotundifolia</font></b> has a deep sounding, hoarse, barking or <i><font color="#0000ff">trumpet-toned cough</font></i>, something like that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Verbascum</font></i>, but there is more laryngeal trouble with <i><font color="#0000ff">Drosera</font></i>, for the voice in talking has a <i><font color="#0000ff">deep
      base sound. Drosera</font></i> is also one of our leading remedies in spasmodic coughs,
      whooping cough. With the cough there is <i><font color="#0000ff">great constriction of the
      chest and abdominal muscles</font></i>, so that the patient holds them with the hands. The
      cough is worse after midnight.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">GAMBOGIA.</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is a very valuable remedy for diarrhœa, though not so often used, I think,
      as it should be. It resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Croton tiglium</font></i> in the
      suddenness of the desire for stool, and in the all coming out at one gush. Again, it resembles
      it, in that it is sometimes watery and yellow, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Croton tig</font></i>.
      is aggravated by the least food or drink, which is not the case with <i><font color="#0000ff">Gambogia</font></i>.
      Again, <i><font color="#0000ff">Gambogia</font></i> has all the way from yellow, watery, to
      almost formed stools, and in each case, the stool comes all at once in one prolonged effort,
      and there is a feeling of great relief after stool, as if an irritating substance were
      removed. Sometimes there is burning of the anus after the stool, similar to <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum, Iris versicolor</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Capsicum</font></i>.
      It is curative in both acute and chronic forms of diarrhœa. There is often much rumbling in
      the bowels.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Gratiola officinalis</font></b> is another remedy that has the yellow,
      watery diarrhœa, gushing out with great force. It is sometimes especially useful in the
      summer complaints of children, especially where they have been drinking too much cold water,
      which frequently happens. <i><font color="#0000ff">Gratiola</font></i> resembles <i><font color="#0000ff">Aloes</font></i> in some points, but has not the hæmorrhoids.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Oleander</font></b> is one of our best remedies for diarrhœa of undigested
      food, and the best indication for it is <i><font color="#0000ff">involuntary stool when
      emitting flatus</font></i>. The least passage of flatus is always accompanied with stool, so
      that the clothes are always liable to be soiled. I cured with the 200th of this remedy a case
      of three years' duration in a child. It was my own child, and I had tried many remedies (it
      was in the beginning of my practice) and was almost despairing that she would ever be well or
      strong, but after taking the <i><font color="#0000ff">Oleander</font></i> she was cured, not
      only of the diarrhœa, but became perfectly strong and well and has always remained so, not
      having the slightest tendency to a return of the trouble.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">I believe the lily of the valley is to become one of our very valuable
      remedies. It ought to receive a Hahnemannian proving. I have used it with much satisfaction in
      women who complained of great <i><font color="#0000ff">soreness in the uterine region and
      sympathetic palpitation of the heart</font></i>. It has also served me well in dropsies of
      cardiac origin, especially in women who have at the same time the above mentioned soreness in
      uterine region. I once checked the progress of a very bad case of cardiac dropsy after the
      effusion in the chest had so increased that the patient could not breathe when lying down, and
      there was much bloody expectoration. I used the 30th potency in this case, though many times
      very fine results follow the use of the remedy in much lower preparations. The dropsy all
      disappeared and she was able to be around and enjoy life very well, though the organic heart
      trouble was not removed.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Bovista</font></b> has been of use to me in only one affection, but in that
      it is invaluable -menorrhagia. The <i><font color="#0000ff">flow is always worse</font></i>,
      or sometimes <i><font color="#0000ff">flows only in the night in bed</font></i>. I do not know
      of a more reliable symptom. It has helped and cured many cases, both acute and chronic.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">It has also sometimes a flow <i><font color="#0000ff">between</font></i>
      the periods like, <i><font color="#0000ff">Ambra grisea</font></i>, but the latter remedy has
      more nervous or hysterical symptoms.</p>
      <b><font color="#ff0000">
      </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#ff0000">Ustilago maydis</font></b> is also a remedy that is very useful in
      menorrhagia or metrorrhagia, and I think I have observed that it is best adapted to those
      cases where the flow is of a passive nature (<i><font color="#0000ff">Thlaspi bursa pastoris</font></i>.)
      There is apt to be more or less pain and irritation, at the same time, in one or both ovaries.
      It is especially useful in these cases at the climacteric. I have cured some very bad cases,
      and always use both this remedy and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bovista</font></i> in the 200th
      potency.</p>

      <p align="JUSTIFY">Is a so-called liver remedy, and I have seen good results from it in liver
      troubles, yet I do not know of any <i><font color="#0000ff">special</font></i> indications for
      its use. I have known cases of habitual colic from gall stones checked and the further
      formation of the stones prevented by this remedy. One of them was a very bad case, for which
      old Dr. Pulte, of Cincinnati, prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Carduus</font></i>. Her
      daughter inherited the trouble, and I saw her, in consultation with another physician, at one
      of these terrible attacks of gall stone colic. She could not lie down, but sat in her chair,
      bent over forward, for forty-eight hours, and during this time she passed two hundred gall
      stones, very hard and nearly the size and shape of a beech-nut, which were found by washing
      the fæces. I have a dozen or so now in a little vial in my office. <i><font color="#0000ff">Carduus</font></i>
      was also a help to her, but she takes, right along for years at a time, olive oil, thinking
      that it dissolves the stones or keeps them from forming.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">When other remedies fail for pain in the region of the liver, with
      dizziness, bad-tasting mouth, jaundiced skin and the usual symptoms called
      "bilious", if I have no special indications for other remedies, I have given <i><font color="#0000ff">Carduus</font></i> and several time with good results. But, as I said before,

      by lying on the <i><font color="#0000ff">left side</font></i>; turning to the left causes a <i><font color="#0000ff">dragging sensation</font></i>. (See <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>,
      which is also &lt; lying on left side and has the dragging sensation. Remember, <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> is generally &gt; lying on <i><font color="#0000ff">painful
      side</font></i>.) <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia mur</font></i>., you will remember, has
      all these symptoms, termed "bilious," but like <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>,

      constipation and diarrhœa alternately. I cured one bad case of liver trouble with <i><font color="#0000ff">Ptelea</font></i> after œdema of the feet and legs had set in; she had the
      symptoms, could not lie comfortably on the left side; her breathing was becoming oppressed,
      and I thought the case looked as if it would not be very likely to be much better. I used the
      30th in this case. The trouble rapidly disappeared and never returned. I considered it a
      brilliant cure.</p>
