      </font><font face="Times New Roman" color="#808080">Presented by Médi-T</font></strong></p>
      <p align="CENTER"><strong><font face="Times New Roman" size="5" color="#000080">Preface</font></strong></p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOR offering this book to the profession, I
      have no apology to make, for I claim my right to do so; and if anyone finds imperfections in
      it, remember I lay no claim to perfection. I can offer severe criticism myself.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will, however, state in brief my object in
      writing as I have:</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIRST.-</font></i>To fasten upon the mind of
      the reader the strongest points in each remedy. Good off-hand prescribing can be done in
      simple uncomplicated cases if we have fixed in our minds, for ready use, the <i><font color="#0000ff">characteristic</font> </i>symptoms.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The elder Lippe was remarkable for such
      ability.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECOND.-</font></i>To try to discourage the
      disposition to quarrel over Symptomatology and Pathology. Neither can be ruled out, and it is
      foolish for our school to divide on such a bone of contention. Every symptom has its
      pathological significance, but we cannot always give it in words; but the fact that it <i><font color="#0000ff">has</font></i> such meaning is sufficient reason for prescribing on the <i><font color="#0000ff">Symptom</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Symptoms</font></i> without
      insisting on, or trying to give, the explanation.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIRD.-</font></i>To insist on the fact that
      the question of dose is still an open one, and so I have taken pains to give the dose I have
      found best, not insisting that anyone is bound to give the same; but it is fair to say that if
      they use a different one and fail, they must blame themselves, not me.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FOURTH.-</font></i>To condemn the abuse of
      drugs, both in the old school and ours.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any one point in the Homoeopathic
      system of Therapeutics that recommends it before that of the old school, it is that we have
      discovered a law by which we are able to apply remedies for the curing of the sick without
      entailing upon them drug effects, often more serious than the original disease.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No honest man of either school ought to
      object to such an improvement in the science of therapeutics.</p>
      <i><font color="#0000ff">
      </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FIFTH.-</font></i>I have hoped to so write as
      to induce any old school physician, who could overcome prejudice so far as to read any or all
      of this book, to experiment along the lines I have indicated, believing that any such
      physician of sound head and honest heart, will be irresistibly led to give Homoeopathy a
      large, and perhaps finally, the largest place in his confidence and practice.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finally to express, after nearly forty years
      of conscientious experimentation, my firm and confirmed belief in the Simillimum, the single
      remedy and the minimum dose.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanking the profession in general for their
      help to me, I reciprocate by offering my humble contribution to an already valuable
      homoeopathic literature.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">PREFACE TO SECOND EDITION</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call for a Second Edition of this work,
      and in so short time after its first appearance, is, indeed, very gratifying to me, and I have
      endeavored to make it even more acceptable than at first by valuable additions in the way of
      new remedies, and further comparisons. I have tried to avoid increasing the size of the work
      at the expense of its reliability, which is an error into which many authors have fallen.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an age of speculation, and
      "fads" of all kinds are in order, but disappointment and failure is the sure
      outcome. I believe in the Homoeopathy taught by Hahnemann, and that is what I purpose to
      proclaim.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanking my colleagues for their appreciation
      of the first edition, as evidenced by the many letters received and the rapid sale of the
      same, I offer the second with increasing confidence and gratitude.</p>

      <p align="CENTER">PREFACE TO THIRD EDITION</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOT much by way of preface need be said for
      this third edition of "LEADERS." The demand for it is evidence that the work has,
      among other popular works, taken its place to stay. That this is very gratifying to the author
      is quite reasonable to suppose, because of the appreciation of his efforts by his professional
      brethren.</p>

      <b><font color="#000080">
      <p align="CENTER">PREFACE TO FOURTH EDITION</p>
      </font></b>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call for the Fourth Edition of this work
      is cause for increased gratification to the author.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition I have received congratulatory
      letters from many physicians in different countries and languages. To my professional
      brethren, who have so kindly received the fruit of my efforts, I return sincere thanks.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have tried in this edition to improve it by
      prefixing to each remedy a few of the leading symptoms, the text of the former editions
      following as a commentary with comparisons. It is hoped by this double arrangement to impress
      the remedies more firmly in the mind for practical off-hand prescribing.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I anticipate the charge that this is
      repetition, and answer, that it is only by repetition oft repeated, that the average mind can
      retain for ready use the salient points in our vast Materia Medica.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not believe that this arrangement will
      lessen the usefulness of "Regional Leaders," which contains over two thousand
      characteristics in self-quiz style, which is very popular with students. To my good wife, who
      has done the clerical work under my dictation, is due much praise. This on account of my
      blindness. As I draw near the end of my earthly career I hope to leave an influence for good
      that will live many years.</p>
      <p align="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May the spirit of pure Homoeopathy formulated
      in the words, "Similia Similibus Curantur," by the Master, possess all those who
      believe this to be the only law of truly scientific medical therapeutics.</p>
