        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 94</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After graduation in Philadelphia, on my return home
        (Candor, N. Y.), I was called to an adjoining town (Danby) to a patient
        who had been in bed twenty years from what was diagnosed then by several
        physicians as "nervous prostration."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I thought this was a hard case for a novice to
        undertake, but on examination was informed by the patient that her whole
        trouble was brought on at first by an exposure to <i><font color="#0000ff">dry
        cold air</font></i> on a long ride, 20 degrees below zero. She had never
        been well since. Now she was troubled with insomnia of long duration.
        She was <i><font color="#0000ff">afraid</font></i> to go to sleep for
        fear she might die. On these indications I prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        6x notwithstanding the chronic character of the case. A month after she
        came walking into my office. She said, I did not report as I promised,
        because I slept good the first night, and have done so ever since, I
        feel well. This was my first case after graduation, many years ago. It
        was a remarkable cure, for it helped both the patient and me&nbsp;; me
        in the establishment of my faith in homœopathy, and the patient so long
        sick to perfect health. (E. E. Snyder.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">RELIGIOUS MANIA</p>
        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#000080">Case 95</font></b><br>
        Religious mania. The patient, a hypersensitive young woman of
        twenty-two. Here, again, is a long history, a case which even with much
        study eluded me for a time. At length I learned that what troubled her
        most was largely a fear of some one discussing religious topics. <i><font color="#0000ff">Then</font></i>
        I found that she feared loss of reason and memory (<i><font color="#0000ff">Calc.
        c</font></i>.) fearful hallucinations at night&nbsp;; fearful dreams (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bell</font></i>.)&nbsp;;
        cannot bear music (<i><font color="#0000ff">Ign</font></i>.)&nbsp;; fear
        of crossing the street lest she be run over&nbsp;; fear that buildings
        would topple over on her or sharp objects come hurling through the air
        and strike her (<i><font color="#0000ff">Arg. nit</font></i>.). Here
        there was no fever, congestion, sensitiveness to cold, dry winds, no
        flushed face (it was very pale), no dry mucous membranes, no thirst. On
        the contrary, there was a mass of evidence against what we so commonly
        hear as the characteristics of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But for this ungovernable fear of almost everything, <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
        is about the only rival to <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>.
        The case examined critically was <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>,
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> one dose, thousandth,
        ended the whole matter. That was five years ago, and now she laughs over
        her former perplexities. I omitted to mention that the alternation of
        moods from extreme gaiety to sadness was of the degree of <i><font color="#0000ff">Crocus</font></i>
        or <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>. (Spencer Carleton).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I have purposely selected these two cases to show how
        wide is the range of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> as
        covering those acute conditions so well known to all true homœopaths,
        and the alternate or chronic conditions which come just as prominently
        under its scope.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The remote effect of <i><font color="#0000ff">exposure
        to dry, cold air</font></i> does not exclude the consideration of the
        remedy even though a severe croup, pneumonia, pleurisy or rheumatism did
        not follow at the time. If they had, the acute well known <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        symptoms would have been present, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        administered then and there would have done the work. The case of Dr.
        Carleton's shows how right Hahnemann was when he put the mind symptoms
        foremost in the Aconite list. The reason this patient was afraid to hear
        talk on religious subjects was her "fear of death (I'll bet). <i><font color="#0000ff">Fear</font></i>
        of death&nbsp;; predicts the day of her death," etc. With such a
        condition, I think, although the doctor did not mention it, that there
        would be at times, if not all the time, great restlessness on account of
        such fear. I will now record a case which will illustrate the action
        (curative) of our remedy in acute conditions. (N.)</p>

        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#000080">Case 96</font></b><br>
        G. S. Can Huesen, ex-sheriff of Cortland county, aged about 60, spare,
        nervous, active, temperament, after exposure to <i><font color="#0000ff">dry,
        cold air</font></i>, came down with rheumatism. It began in the foot and
        ankle. It was <i><font color="#0000ff">swollen, red</font></i>, very
        painful, extorting loud cries from the patient, who had quick pulse and
        high temperature&nbsp;; there was great anxiety, restlessness and
        changing position, although it hurt him. He was in great <i><font color="#0000ff">fear</font></i>
        that it was going to spread all over him and kill him. Wanted something
        to quiet that pain. (Morphine he wanted). So I could give him a powder
        on his tongue (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>.) and
        dissolve <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> 30th in water,
        directing his daughter to give him a teaspoonful once in one-half hour
        until he was easier. He was asleep in two hours, had a good night, and
        next morning the swelling was half gone, and all the other symptoms were
        correspondingly ameliorated. Recovery was rapid and complete. (Nash).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Any acute inflammatory disease with <i><font color="#0000ff">these
        symptoms</font></i> cannot fail to be favourably influenced or cured by
        this remedy, especially in the first stage, or before the stage of
        effusion has set in.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mark now that what I say, when <i><font color="#0000ff">these
        symptoms</font></i> are present. I wish to guard against the too common
        error of prescribing <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> in the
        beginning of inflammatory diseases indiscriminately. The slovenly
        routinism too common in our ranks cannot be too severely condemned. The
        practitioner who cannot differentiate between <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite,
        Belladonna, Ferrum phos., Gelsem., Chamomilla</font></i>, etc., in the
        first of such diseases deserves the severest condemnation.</p>
