        <p align="JUSTIFY">I wish here to call attention to the very great value
        of this remedy in cholera morbus. Raue says, <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i>
        is the most important and most frequently indicated remedy, and does not
        even mention <i><font color="#0000ff">Antimonium tart</font></i>. Bell.
        does not give it a prominent place. Jahr does not mention it in his
        "Forty Years." I first cured myself of a most severe attack of
        cholera morbus after the failure of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac</font></i>.
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Veratrum</font></i>. The relief was so <i><font color="#0000ff">positive</font></i>
        and the action of the medicine so sensibly felt, and felt again after a
        return of the symptoms, which were relieved within two minutes after a
        dose of a few pellets of the third centesimal upon the tongue, that I
        shall never forget it. The symptoms which were present, and which I have
        often found present in many cases, and which are invariably relieved by
        this remedy (see symptoms 19, 20 and 21 Lippe's Tex Book) are&nbsp;:<br>
        "Violent straining to vomit with perspiration on the forehead.<br>
        "Continuous nausea, vomiting and diarrhœa.<br>
        "Vomiting of food with great effort, <i><font color="#0000ff">followed
        by debility, chilliness and sleepiness</font></i>. For the last forty
        years I have found this remedy oftener indicated in cholera morbus than
        any other. I use it from the 6th upward." (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">CROUP</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 62</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">January 23, 1879. A little girl, scarcely more than
        two years old, was taken with a violent attack of croup. At 6 P. M. her
        respiration was stertorous, the walls of the chest rising and falling
        like a pair of bellows. Her head was thrown back, and the eyes were
        starting from their sockets in the struggle for breath. Her voice was
        entirely gone&nbsp;; she could speak only in a hoarse whisper. The skin
        was hot and dry. Tongue whitish with red points. Not knowing the true <i><font color="#0000ff">similimum</font></i>,
        I ordered cloths wrung out of hot water to be applied to the chest and
        throat, and, after some hesitation I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellad</font></i>.
        200th.<br>
        At 8 P. M. I saw her again. She was no better, still I did not change
        the remedy. Being called elsewhere I did not see her again until 11 P.
        M., when I found her much worse.<br>
        She was throwing herself wildly about. There was cold perspiration upon
        the forehead&nbsp;; the skin of the face, especially around the mouth
        and on the cheeks, was of a dusky hue from non-oxygenization of the
        blood, and there was a <i><font color="#0000ff">sound in the larynx as
        of an accumulation of mucus, which would be expectorated if it came up</font></i>.<br>
        In the provings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i>
        made by Hahnemann and published in the Archives in 1824 there are two or
        three principal symptoms, as follows&nbsp;:<br>
        Mucus rattling in the chest.<br>
        Oppression of the breathing.<br>
        In the morning, at 3 o'clock, he became oppressed so that he cannot
        breathe.<br>
        He must sit up to get air.<br>
        When beginning to cough he gasps for air as if he could not breathe.<br>
        The first of these symptoms have been brilliantly confirmed by Doctor H.
        N. Guernsey, and expressed in the style of the above italicized
        symptoms, now forms one of his series of "lay notes." On
        referring to the Materia Medica I found the one symptom upon which I was
        doubtful, namely, cold sweat on the forehead, in Lippe's Text Book,
        symptom<br>
        69. I, therefore, gave the <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i>
        54m. in water.<br>
        In half an hour the breathing became easier, the voice was regained, and
        shortly after midnight the cough became loose and of natural tone&nbsp;;
        large quantities of thick yellow mucus being raised. At 1 o'clock A. M.
        she could drink water without struggling for breath, and as she had not
        been weaned, notwithstanding her age, her mother gave her the breast.
        She continued to nurse for sometime without once stopping to gasp. At 2
        o'clock A. M. she was sleeping peacefully.<br>
        The next day, in disobedience to my injunction, the child was allowed to
        stand in a draught from an open door while covered with a warm
        perspiration. That same evening, about 8 o'clock, she was attacked again
        with the same symptoms in a milder form.<br>
        The before-mentioned keynote "cropped out", and I gave her one
        dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar emetic</font></i> 45m. on the
        tongue. In an hour or two she was relieved. (W. M. James.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">PARALYSIS</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 63</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Watrous, aged 85, suddenly became paralyzed, one
        whole side. After a short time he went into an unconscious condition,
        and his breathing became very difficult, with coarse rattling of mucus
        and cyanosed look of the face. This looked like paralysis of the lungs,
        in keeping with the rest of his paralytic state. But he would swallow
        yet if fluid was put into his mouth. So I mixed a few pellets of <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar
        emetic</font></i> c. m. in water, and told them they might give him a
        teaspoonful once an hour as long as he could swallow. The effect was
        splendid. He came promptly out of his comatose condition, and lived two
        years, but, of course, he did not at that age regain the use of the
        paralyzed side. (Nash).<br>
        Again, I had a very obstinate case of intermittent fever in my early
        practice. I had floundered around among the routine remedies (<i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>
        among the rest) for weeks, and felt disgusted with <i><font color="#0000ff">myself</font></i>,
        for I knew homœopathy was all right if I could only apply&nbsp;;
        finally on these symptoms-<br>
        1. Short chill followed by<br>
        2. Long lasting heat, with<br>
        3. Somnolency, with pale face and sweat on forehead - I prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Tartar
        emetic</font></i> 200th. The next paroxysm was much lighter, the next
        has never come since thirty years ago. It never will. (Nash.)</p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#000080">RÉSUMÉ</font></b><br>
        1. Great accumulation of mucus in the air passages with coarse rattling
        and inability to expectorate.<br>
        2. Face very pale or cyanotic from unoxidized blood.<br>
        3. Great coma or sleepiness in many complaints.<br>
        4. Vomiting, intense nausea with prostration, coldness and cold sweat
        and sleepiness.<br>
        5. Trembling internal and head and hands.<br>
        6. Thick eruptions like pocks often pustular&nbsp;; as large as a pea.<br>
        7. <i><font color="#0000ff">Modalities</font></i> &gt; from
        expectoration.</p>
