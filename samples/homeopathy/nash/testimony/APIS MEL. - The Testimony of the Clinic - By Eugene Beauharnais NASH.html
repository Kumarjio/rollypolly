        <p align="CENTER">DIPHTHERIA</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 1</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">October 27, 1877, was called in consultation with Dr.
        Gulick, at Watkins, N. Y. Found the place passing through a very severe
        epidemic of diphtheria. Every person that had been attacked, forty in
        number, had died, and four were lying dead that day. Every physician of
        all schools had lost one or more. The homœopathic physician to whom I
        was called in consultation, a man of age, ability and large experience,
        expressed himself thus&nbsp;: "Doctor, I am on my knees to anybody
        who can help me." One child had already died in the family to which
        I was called, and this second one was apparently well on the way to the
        same end.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Girl, age 14 years, light hair, blue eyes, nervous
        temperament. Had been sick several days. Looking into the throat I found
        the tonsils and uvula greatly swollen&nbsp;; the tonsils so much so that
        the throat was almost completely closed and the uvula hanging (<i><font color="#0000ff">very
        much elongated and looking like a bag of water</font></i>) down in front
        of and against them. The whole throat presented a decidedly <i><font color="#0000ff">œdematous
        appearance</font></i>. Both tonsils were patched with yellowish
        membrane, with a ring of the same around the <i><font color="#0000ff">uvula</font></i>.
        Breath exceedingly offensive. There was stopping of the nose (the
        breathing could be heard across two large rooms), swallowing was almost
        impossible on account of the great pain, which streaked up into both
        ears&nbsp;; there was prostration, restlessness with <i><font color="#0000ff">tossing</font></i>
        about, sleeplessness, pulse 130, skin <i><font color="#0000ff">alternately
        hot and dry, and then perspiring profusely</font></i> (very
        characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>). Here was a
        case in which one remedy was clearly and perfectly <i><font color="#0000ff">indicated</font></i>.
        The doctor had used <i><font color="#0000ff">Bell., Merc. prot</font></i>.
        and other remedies which had served him well in previous epidemics. But
        they were of no use here for the simple reason that the two epidemics
        were no alike, and different remedies indicated. <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
        6th was given once in two hours, with the effect of reducing the pulse
        to 100 in six hours, and checking the progress of the whole disease at
        once, which improvement continued until complete recovery without
        sequelæ.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This was the remedy for the <i><font color="#0000ff">genus
        epidemicus</font></i> and cured all cases in which it was used but one,
        which received it too late.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A case just across the road (in which home one had
        also died) received the same remedy in the 200th dilution, and made a
        rapid recovery. Another case was attacked, and the good doctor, who I
        imagine felt a little chagrined because he had not found the then
        comparatively new remedy (<i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>),
        came across the account of Dr. Von Villiers' success with <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius
        cyanuret</font></i>, and showed it to the family, proposing to try that.
        They objected, saying that the other remedy had cured, why try a new
        one. But the doctor persisted, saying the would be responsible. Gave it
        and lost his case. He could never forgive himself, nor could the family.
        I relate this to impress upon all that no matter what success a remedy
        may have had in the past, the <i><font color="#0000ff">indications</font></i>
        must be there or it cannot succeed. <i><font color="#0000ff">Jahr</font></i>
        praised <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i> in his "<i><font color="#0000ff">Forty
        Years Practice</font></i>." Fetterhoff, of Pennsylvania, confirmed
        it in an epidemic there. During this epidemic in Watkins the 6th, 30th
        and 200th dilutions were equally successful. No remedy has such rapid
        and intense œdema of the throat as <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis. Kali
        bichromicum</font></i> has œdema of uvula, but the two remedies have
        not much in common. (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">TONSILLITIS</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 2</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Thursday, January 6, 1881, late in the evening I was
        called to see Mr. P-----, aged 30, I found him suffering from
        tonsillitis, the right tonsil being so swollen and sore as to make
        deglutition of solids impossible, and fluids almost so. The whole fauces
        looked red, and uvula was much swollen. He described the pains as
        stitching, especially in swallowing. I gave him <i><font color="#0000ff">Hepar
        sulph</font></i>., 30th one in two hours. Calling the next morning I
        found he had had a restless night, and was feeling no better.
        Examination of the throat by daylight showed uvula looking like a sack
        of water, and he described the pain as "<i><font color="#0000ff">burning,
        stinging</font></i>." I gave him <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis mel</font></i>.
        70m. (Fincke), a few pellets dissolved in half a tumbler of water, two
        teaspoonfuls once in four hours. The next morning, January 7th, I found
        he had rested well all night, and had eaten breakfast without
        difficulty. He got <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>. and
        resumed his business on Monday.</p>

        <p align="CENTER">INFLAMMATION LABIA MAJORA</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 3</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A gentleman called on me to prescribe for his wife,
        who is very fleshy, and three or four years past the climacteric. She
        had a swelling of the left labium vaginæ, which he described as hard,
        hot and of a bluish red color. The side and the color determined the
        prescription, and she got <i><font color="#0000ff">Lach</font></i>. 30th
        in water once in two hours. This was January 13th, 1881. On the 15th he
        reported not much change except that it did not seem quite so hard, and
        she got <i><font color="#0000ff">Lach</font></i>. c. c. in water once in
        two hours. The 17th he reported that there was less soreness but more
        swelling, and the heat and color about the same. Gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Lach</font></i>.
        c. m. once in four hours. Next day I saw the patient for the first time,
        and on examination found that the swelling was not, as I had supposed,
        phlegmonous&nbsp;; but, while it was enormous, it was puffy (œdematous)
        and very sore when sitting, with a <i><font color="#0000ff">burning
        stinging</font></i> pain. This decided a change to <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis
        mel</font></i>. 70 m. in water, a dose once in four hours, which in two
        days ended the case. (Dr. Hawley.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS&nbsp;:- These two cases show that it is often
        possible, even with so good a prescriber as Dr. Hawley, to make a wrong
        prescription at first. The first case was not "sticking" pains
        as the patient described them, but stinging pains, and the œdematous
        appearance settled it. The second case was first prescribed for on
        "hearsay." Personal examination by the doctor showed the
        "naked truth" and the proper remedy cured. All busy physicians
        make just such mistakes and consequent failures, but when the right
        remedy gets in its work it never fails where a cure is possible. (N.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">TYPHOID FEVER</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 4</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I was called to see Master Curtis, aged 12 years. His
        brother, 14 years old, was also sick in the same room. Both had typhoid
        fever. One brother, older still, had just died of typhoid hæmorrhage
        under electric treatment. The case, 14 years of age, took on the
        abdominal form of typhoid, and ran a comparatively mild course for two
        weeks. The abdomen was greatly distended, with much rumbling of
        flatulence, but no movement or diarrhœa. He was soporific, but when he
        did awaken, would <i><font color="#0000ff">kick and scream and was
        violent and cross</font></i>, though not much delirium. For this
        condition he received <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i> 2
        c. with prompt improvement, which continued until he was well.<br>
        The 12 year old boy, after the first week under various remedies, such
        as <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia, Baptisia</font></i> c. c., grew
        rapidly worse until the following symptoms appeared and persisted&nbsp;:<br>
        For hours at a time in complete unconsciousness his <i><font color="#0000ff">head
        would spasmodically</font></i> jerk up from the pillow with a scream,
        and twisted or carried around a semi-circle and drop down again. This
        would be followed by a profound <i><font color="#0000ff">sopor,
        interrupted with piercing screams</font></i>. There was no movement of
        the bowels for three weeks, and the urine was scanty, at one time for
        forty-eight hours none at all.<br>
        The abdomen was sunken in, hollowed out like a boat. The pupils were
        widely dilated, with not the least reaction to strong light. The tongue
        was shrivelled, and so paralyzed that for ten days after consciousness
        returned not a word could be spoken. The first word he did speak was <i><font color="#0000ff">Maw</font></i>
        (Ma), the next <i><font color="#0000ff">pawidge</font></i> (<i><font color="#0000ff">porridge</font></i>).
        The face during the intensely wild delirium and spasms was very red and
        during the sopor pale. Here was a case in which two remedies seemed
        about equally indicated at <i><font color="#0000ff">different times</font></i>,
        and they were used as Hahnemann used <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> in his typhoid fever
        epidemic. <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i> was used in the
        first described conditions, and when it changed <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis
        mel</font></i>. was used. The patient made a perfect recovery under
        these two remedies so used. (Nash.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- This is the only kind of alternation of
        remedies that can be defended from the standpoint of <i><font color="#0000ff">Similia
        Similibus</font></i>.<br>
        I have had two other similar cases cured with the same remedies. In
        these cases the disease takes the cerebral form, and there is probably
        effusion into the meninges which is removed by <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>.

        <p align="CENTER">HYDROCEPHALUS</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 5</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A four-year-old son of German parents was given up by
        the attending physician as a case of hopeless <i><font color="#0000ff">hydrocephalus</font></i>.
        When first seen the child was lying on its back, with eyes wide open,
        extreme squinting, dilated pupils, rolling of eyeballs without winking.
        He gave no evidence of seeing when the fingers were thrust toward the
        eye&nbsp;; when pricked with a pin no sign of feeling&nbsp;; when water
        was put into his mouth no effort at swallowing was made. The left side
        had been entirely motionless for two days, but he moved the right arm
        and leg occasionally. He had passed no water for forty-eight hours, but
        the region of the bladder showed very slight distension. Drugs had
        produced no stool for several days. At the commencement of his illness
        he complained of pain in the occiput with <i><font color="#0000ff">occasional
        sharp shrieks</font></i>. He had been blistered with <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharides</font></i>
        from the nape of the neck to the lumbar region two days previously,
        since which time he had passed no water, and given no evidence of
        seeing, hearing or feeling. <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
        30th. After five days he had so far recovered that he sat bolstered up
        in bed&nbsp;; he moved both sides of the body equally well, and his
        senses were restored. (W. P. Wesselhoeft.)<br>
        These few cases show the undoubted action of <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis
        mellifica</font></i>. It will act in high or low potencies according to
        susceptibility of the patient, its grand keynote indications
        being&nbsp;:<br>
        SUBJECTIVE. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Burning, stinging pains</font></i>,
        especially in skin, mucous and serous membranes.<br>
        OBJECTIVE. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Œdema</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">dropsies</font></i>,
        local or general.<br>
        MODALITIES. - <i><font color="#0000ff">Great tenderness to touch or
