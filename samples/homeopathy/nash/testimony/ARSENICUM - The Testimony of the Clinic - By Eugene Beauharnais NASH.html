        <p align="CENTER">CANCER OF STOMACH</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 72</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">July 31, 1887, I was called to J. P. G., aged 66,
        tall, spare man, stoop-shouldered, emaciated, of a yellow, waxy
        complexion&nbsp;; his lips and tongue of the same color. A more complete
        pallor could not be. For more than twenty years he had been a constant
        sufferer from a disordered stomach, which physicians had characterized a
        dyspepsia and gastralgia. For the last year or more it had been attended
        with frequent vomiting of his food, especially if he took any solid
        food, for which reason his physician had put him on exclusive diet of
        peptonized milk, to which he had been confined for something over six
        months. He was expected to take three quarts daily, taking a given
        quantity once in three hours. Sometimes the stomach rejected it very
        soon, and at others he would go two or three days without vomiting.<br>
        Hunger was a constant symptom. The emesis usually occurred without
        nausea, but was always preceded by intense pains in the hypogastrium and
        violent eructations of tasteless gas from the stomach, affording
        momentary relief. Escape of flatus from the bowels also afforded relief.
        He has a double hernia of some six years continuance, and a chronic
        prostatitis, which for some ten or twelve years has compelled him always
        to use a catheter to void urine. During these attacks of violent pain,
        ending in vomiting, and at some times it was impossible to pass the
        catheter until he could get an escape of flatus from the bowels, when it
        would pass without difficulty.<br>
        His sleep was much disturbed, and when he slept he was sure to wake
        about three in the morning, and lie awake till after daylight. There was
        much burning and soreness of the stomach, for relief from which he took
        domestic soda as he judged best.<br>
        At the time of my visit he had just reached home from a summer resort,
        whither he went by the advice of a physician in hope of improvement, and
        was in the midst of one of his attacks of severe suffering, which had
        attended him all the way on his journey home, and was so severe that he
        and his friends thought he would die before he got home. I found him in
        bed, but in such agony that he was all over it in his efforts to get
        relief from change of position&nbsp;; at one moment sitting up and
        belching off quantities of tasteless flatus, the next lying on his face
        or bending over to press the legs against the abdomen. He was thirsty,
        but dared not drink because water distressed his stomach. The pains he
        described as burning, grinding, pressing and sometimes cutting and
        tearing. His bowels were constipated, seldom moved without enemata.<br>
        I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> 30 in frequent
        repetition, but without any apparent relief till he vomited about an
        hour after my coming. He ejected fully three pints of a milky fluid,
        like milk mixed with water slightly muddy, having a slightly sour taste
        and odor, but without coagula. The vomiting gave instant relief, and I
        left him on the <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux</font></i>, a dose once in
        three hours.<br>
        July 31. Found him cheery and comfortable. The milk was discontinued and
        gruels substituted. The remedy continued.<br>
        August 1. Found him comfortable after a fair amount of sleep during the
        night. Continued the remedy. About 9 o'clock in the evening of that day
        was called again to see him, and found him again in great distress,
        which continued till after midnight. At times he would belch volumes of
        flatus with relief for a moment. He was much inclined to bend over,
        pressing his abdomen or arms folded across his legs, sometimes with a
        pillow and sometimes without. I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth</font></i>.
        30 every few minutes. After an hour or more I made a thorough
        exploration of the abdomen, and found what seemed to me an evident
        thickening of the wall of the stomach near the pyloric orifice, so
        marked as to suggest cancer, which had not before occurred to me. At
        last, after nearly four hours of dreadful suffering, he vomited again
        about three pints, and was relieved.<br>
        The matter ejected had the color and appearance of unsettled coffee. He
        was left on <i><font color="#0000ff">Coloc</font></i>. 30, once in three
        hours, if awake.<br>
        August 2. Found him free from pain after a good sleep. The ejecta of the
        night before, as much as a quart bottle would hold, looked like coffee,
        and the apparent grounds occupied about one-third of the space.<br>
        The gravity of the case was such that I suggested that they might like
        further council. The suggestion was gladly accepted, and the patient and
        his wife made choice of Dr. Smith, a homœopath of large experience,
        residing in Geneva, N. Y., and of their friend, and for six years
        attending physician, Dr. Coe, who is a so-called "regular".
        Some three days later they met me at his bedside. Meantime the patient
        had been on <i><font color="#0000ff">Ars</font></i>. 40m., Fincke, in
        solution, a teaspoonful once in three hours, with no vomiting till the
        morning of our meeting, when vomited about a half pint of coffee grounds
        after a short period of suffering similar to that described above but
        much less intense. After giving the council a statement of the case, I
        asked them to make an examination and diagnosis. Dr. Smith very soon
        satisfied himself that there was thickening of the stomach in the region
        of the pylorus. Dr. Coe made search for it, and though he could feel it,
        but was not quite clear that he did so.<br>
        I then exhibited the ejecta of that morning and of three days before,
        when both were of the opinion that the case was one of cancer of the
        stomach. Prognosis very unfavourable.<br>
        No change was made in the remedy, and the Ars. was continued once in
        four hours till the 8th of August, when it was so evident the patient
        was improving that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>. was
        substituted.<br>
        I saw him every day, but while his ability to take nourishment improved
        daily so that he could chew a little beef once or twice a day with
        relish and comfort, the constipation did not yield, and he got on the
        25th of August <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> 50m., one
        dose, followed by <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>. A second
        dose was given September 5th, and then Sac. lac. continued. The
        constipation was relieved, and the case was dismissed September 22nd.
        without further medication.<br>
        Improvement began with the administration of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>,
        and there was no vomiting after the morning of the council, but he was
        so feeble as to require daily visits till the 31st of August, though
        before this he had taken several short drives in an easy carriage. For
        ten or twelve days before he was discharged from my care he was in his
        office and at work several hours each day.<br>
        On the 26th of April last he called to tell me he was to leave with his
        wife the next day for Colorado. He added that he weighed 185 pounds,
        more than ever before in his life, and said he had the appetite and
        relish of a boy. His pallor was entirely gone, and his cheeks were
        fairly ruddy. (Hawley.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">I had a similar case. It was of long standing. The
        tumor of the stomach or rather just below the pit of the stomach was the
        size of my two fits&nbsp;; it was very large. After the coffee grounds
        vomit appeared twice then came a large wash bowl full of vomitus looking
        like molasses&nbsp;; these were signs of dissolution. That case received
        a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> at that time,
        and has never received a dose since, and she has been well for two
        years. No repetition of the remedy. (Biegler.)</p>

        Florence Johnson, a young woman, had been afflicted a long time with
        chronic gastritis. She was unable to take ordinary food without great <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>
        and distress in her stomach. This condition of stomach was relieved when
        she had eczema of both ears, which was intensely painful and <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>.
        She would sometimes succeed in healing the ears, but in proportion as
        she succeeded in that the stomach symptoms returned. Then she would get
        very poor in flesh. I had given her <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> without perceptible
        benefit and also <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> 30 and
        200. Finally I concluded to try the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
        higher. Gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> 37m.,
        made on my own potentizer, and the effect was wonderful. The whole
        trouble promptly yielded, and she had no trouble since now several
        years. I forgot to say that she also had scalp trouble of a similar
        nature with that of the ears, which also subsided. (Nash.)</p>

        dyspnœa with great <i><font color="#0000ff">restlessness and tossing
        about in agony and extreme prostration</font></i> set in. These were all
        Arsenicum symptoms, and this remedy in frequently repeated doses
        relieved all those distressing and dangerous symptoms in a very short

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Hayford, age 35, had severe attacks of
        gastralgia. They came on a little <i><font color="#0000ff">after
        midnight and lasted until</font></i> 3 A. M. I asked her what was the
        character of the pains. She answered, <i><font color="#0000ff">burning</font></i>
        as if my stomach was full of live coals. What have you done four
        yourself&nbsp;? Everything I can think of, but the only relief I can get
        is to walk the floor with a <i><font color="#0000ff">hot water bag</font></i>
        held across my stomach. I am blistered now with it, and I am growing
        weak from pains and loss of rest, fairly <i><font color="#0000ff">prostrated</font></i>.
        The veriest tyro would not hesitate to prescribe <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
        for such a case, which I did, with a promise to call next day. I was
        very busy at the time, and forgot all about the case for a week, when,
        passing the house one day, it came to mind. Then I went in and found the
        patient at her house work looking bright and happy. Well, said I, how
        are you&nbsp;? Are you dead, well or got another doctor&nbsp;? I forgot
        you. She answered, I am not dead or sent for another doctor, and I
        haven't had any more of those attacks of pain&nbsp;; but, doctor, would
        that medicine send out salt rheum&nbsp;? Ah, you had salt rheum before
        you had the gastralgia. Yes. You cured or rather suppressed it with an
        ointment. Yes. That was the cause of your trouble in the stomach. But,
        doctor, I don't want either. We'll try to make you better of both. Which
        we did by letting the <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> act.<br>
        She moved away from Cortland about a year after, and, while not entirely
        cured of the eczema, was very much better. (Nash.)<br>
        I have given these cases of my own here not only to illustrate the homœopathicity
        of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i> from the symptomatic
        standpoint, but to also show the intimate relationship of skin to
        internal affections, which some deny. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum</font></i>
        is certainly one of our greatest antipsorics.<br>
        It would take a book larger than I propose to make this one to sound the
        praises of this remedy of wide range and deep action. (N.)</p>

        B., aged 45, had for many years suffered from a very delicate and
        irritable stomach, from cankerous sore mouth (cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Phytolacca</font></i>),
        all in consequence of what is mistermed scientific treatment. She also
        had suffered from hay fever, regularly returning every year on the 16th
        of September.<br>
        Mrs. B. returned from Europe, after an absence of several years, on the
        26th of July last&nbsp;; the voyage had been a very unpleasant
        one&nbsp;; she had been very seasick all the time. From the time she
        left Liverpool till she was visited by me, on the 27th of July, she had
        taken literally no nourishment&nbsp;; broken ice was the only thing that
        had passed her lips. I found her sitting up, occasionally straining to
        vomit, very weak, pulse 116 per minute&nbsp;; she complained of a
        violent pain in the occiput, with great heat, which she had tried to
        relieve by applications of broken ice&nbsp;; urinary secretions
        suppressed&nbsp;; mouth dry and hot&nbsp;; she had not slept for
        fortnight, and could not lie down on account of great nervousness, as
        she expressed it, which compelled her to change her position and her
        chair so very often&nbsp;; she wandered about all night from chair to
        chair&nbsp;; was very disagreeable&nbsp;; perfect loathing of food, and
        for a few days had a watery, very offensive and black looking diarrhœa.
        The choice of the remedy was easy enough. I gave her one dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum
        alb</font></i>. 50m. (Fincke), on her tongue, July 27th (10 A. M.). July
        28th had slept in her bed from 10 P. M. till 1 A. M., then became
        nervous and restless, but says that she feels better. No medicine.<br>
        July 29. She has been in bed all night&nbsp;; slept&nbsp;; and no return
        of the diarrhœa&nbsp;; urinary secretions re-established&nbsp;; the hot
        water applications to her head have very much relieved the pain, had
        later some milk toast, and relished it&nbsp;; pulse below 90&nbsp;; is
        cheerful and hopeful.<br>
        July 31. Had a still better night&nbsp;; is better in every respect, but
        complains of severe pains in a bunion on the left foot&nbsp;; it is much
        inflamed and stings. I gave her now one dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric
        acid</font></i>. c. m. (Fincke).<br>
        August 1. The bunion is less painful, otherwise there is not much change
        perceptible.<br>
        August 2. Bunion still improving, and on August 3rd no more pain or
        inflammation in it. In the evening, same day, I was again summoned to
        see her&nbsp;; found her quite ill&nbsp;; the diarrhœa and vomiting had
        returned with great violence&nbsp;; pulse over 110&nbsp;; the same
        headache as on the 27th had also returned, also the great restlessness.
        Gave her one dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum album</font></i>
        (Fincke) dry on her tongue. Found her better the next day, and the
        improvement continued&nbsp;; on the 6th of August her bunion began to
        pain her again as on the 21st. Gave no medicine. Improvement continued
        satisfactorily&nbsp;; when the 16th of September came she had that
        night, about 1 A. M., some oppression of breathing, which reminded her
        of the terrible asthmatic attacks she had had years ago&nbsp;; she had
        to sit up for half an hour. <i><font color="#0000ff">No medicine</font></i>.
        She fully recovered and traveled for some weeks&nbsp;; had no hay
        fever&nbsp;; really has had nothing to complain of since&nbsp;; enjoys
        better health than she has had for years (Ad. Lippe.)<br>
        This is a very instructive case, and illustrates several well known
        principles. First, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Nitric acid</font></i>.
        should not have been given because the bunion was only a part of the
        disease condition for which the right remedy was already prescribed.
        This was proved in the fact that when the bunion disappeared the
        original symptoms returned. Hering used to say that when a disease
        travelled from within outward it was all right, but from without inward
        was wrong. We all know that this is eminently true in regard to
        eruptions on the skin. In other words, if a disease moves from vital
        organs or centres outward or downward to the extremities it is
        favourable. Let the remedy that has caused this act. Again, we are
        taught here that although a mistake was made here (and the best
        prescribers sometimes make them) it was not irreparable, and the
        original remedy repeated cured the case. Mistakes, however, are not
        always so easily repaired, so it stands us in hand to observe closely
        what an apparently new symptom or condition means before we meddle.<br>
        This case of Dr. Lippe's (who was one of the best prescribers that ever
        lived) is taken from the "Organon" (Journal), Vol. 1, page 39.
        He has there given a more exhaustive commentary on the case, which is
        too lengthy to transcribe here. It is well worth hunting up and reading.

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 78</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Jehial Clark, aged about 60, was afflicted with
        one of the worst forms of sciatica. Her brother, Charles Sanders, of New
        York, of "School Reader" fame, was already a cripple from the
        same disease, allopathically treated. In this patient's case the pains
        were intense, with decided burning sensation. They were greatly
        aggravated from 1 to 3 in the morning. She was greatly prostrated from
        her suffering. The only way she could get any rest (for she was
        exceedingly restless, continually wanting to be changed from place to
        place) was from bags of dry hot salt continually applied along the
        nerve. There were other symptoms, but these are enough to show the
        remedy that a homœopath would naturally prescribe. <i><font color="#0000ff">Arsenicum
        alb</font></i>. was given in the 30 and 200. To my surprise no good came
        of it. Then <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> was given in the
        possibility that psora was complicating matters, but with no good result
        given. Now other remedies were tried, but, of course, ineffectually.<br>
        I had one thing in my favor, the history of her brother's case, which
        had run much longer than hers. So there was no object in her changing to
        the old school, especially as he had been left an incurable cripple. It
        was in the earlier part of my practice, so I had not gotten much above
        the 200th potency then. But I had a graft of Jenichen's 8,000th in the
        office, so as nothing else did any good I concluded to try it. It was
