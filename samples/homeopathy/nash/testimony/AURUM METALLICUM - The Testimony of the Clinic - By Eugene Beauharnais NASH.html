        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 6</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the month of February, 1906, I was requested by a
        noted specialist to see a case in consultation of frontal sinus abscess.
        He said that he had operated on it, but the sore would not heal, and
        hoped that something might be done to promote the healing process.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. A. J. L., age 61 years, spare, dark olive-brown
        complexion, sallow. Abscess of frontal sinus&nbsp;; has been operated.
        Nodes or swellings in periosteum (knees, shin and clavicle), small
        joints enlarged. These swellings are painful, sensitive and very hot to
        touch. Has taken <i><font color="#0000ff">much Mercury</font></i>.
        Bowels very constipated&nbsp;; little black balls like sheep dung.
        Oppressive choking sensation, wants to take a <i><font color="#0000ff">long
        breath frequently</font></i>. Weeps much&nbsp;; is very
        melancholy&nbsp;; thinks she ought to die and get out of the way, is no
        good and never will be.<br>
        Taking into acount these things, first, chronic poisoning with
        mercury&nbsp;; second, the location of the caries (nasofrontal)&nbsp;;
        third, the depression of mind, we advised <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum
        met</font></i>., six powders of the 200th (B. &amp; T.) to be taken dry
        on the tongue one week apart. The following letter will show the
        results&nbsp;:</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">E. B. NASH, M. D.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">My dear Doctor&nbsp;:</font></i> I am Dr.
        P-----'s frontal sinus patient that you visited at the Ophthalmic
        Hospital in New York in February. For eighteen months the left frontal
        sinus had been open, and every other day was treated. What I suffered
        words cannot tell. That tube had to be taken out and replaced, and I
        could not take cocaine or anæsthetics, so I had to just grin and bear
        it&nbsp;; but the tissue would not form&nbsp;; the wound would not heal.
        In January I again went to both Dr. P----- and Dr. M-----&nbsp;; told me
        there was no hope for me unless I submitted to a dreadful operation that
        would disfigure me for life. This I refused, and when you came to see me
        I was <i><font color="#0000ff">in</font></i> the depths of despair. You
        prescribed, and now, in six weeks, the sinus is filled up, the wound is
        healed, and to-day I am without a patch. I have only taken six powders.
        It seems a miracle to me. I had given up hope. I am not nearly so
        nervous&nbsp;; have only had two nightmares since taking the medicine
        (and I used to waken the house-hold every few nights.). My constipation
        is better, but not what it should be. The little black sheep marbles
        have disappeared&nbsp;; the discharge is now light colored, slender,
        choppy or broken off looking&nbsp;; not every day. Every little exertion
        makes me break out in profuse perspiration, but I am stronger than I was
        when you saw me, and I believe if you could take me in hand I might be a
        good deal better.</p>
        <p align="RIGHT">Sincerely Yours,<br>
        Mrs. F. H. L.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This case is interesting in all ways, but I wish to
        call attention particularly to the potency used. So many think that gold
        and the other metals cannot be potentized above demonstrable
        divisibility of matter. I shall have occasion to show differently in my
        report of cases further on (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">RHEUMATISM</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 7</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A boy of thirteen, becoming overheated while roller
        skating, sat down on a curb stone to cool off. A severe cold resulted
        with general aching&nbsp;; next rheumatism of knees and ankles
        developed&nbsp;; worse on motion. Next day it had left the legs and
        attacked the shoulders and arms. From that point it flew back to the
        feet, which began to swell. He had received <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia,
        Lachnanthes, Ledum</font></i>, etc., according to the symptoms&nbsp;;
        but at this point I was confined myself to my home for some days, and
        had to rely upon the reports of his parents, which were vague and
        indefinite. They now reported that while the feet continued to swell,
        the rheumatism was gone, but that now he had pain in his chest&nbsp;; it
        hurt him to breathe, was impossible for him to take a long breath. I
        gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>, then <i><font color="#0000ff">Cimicifuga</font></i>
        upon their representation, without good result&nbsp;; the boy grew
        worse. On the sixth day the mother reported that the boy was so weak
        that he could scarcely speak. I cross-questioned her very closely. Among
        other things asked, lying upon which side was the pain worse&nbsp;?
        "O," exclaimed the poor, stupid woman, "I forgot to tell
        you, he can't lie down at all. He hasn't lain down for five nights. We
        have him in a Morris chair. He sits bent forward all night with his head
        resting in chin strap made of towels." A light broke upon me. Then
        I knew it was no pleurisy I had to deal with, but rheumatism of the
        heart. I hastened to his home. As I entered the room I was shocked at
        the pitiful change in the child since I had seen him six days before.
        The labored gasps for breath could be heard outside the door, the little
        figure sat bent forward in the Morris chair, face blue, cyanotic,
        swollen, feet and ankles swollen as big as watermelons&nbsp;; but the
        thing that struck me most as I entered was the terrific visible
        throbbing of the carotids, which could be seen across the room. It was
        with great difficulty that I could examine his heart&nbsp;; he could not
        endure the least touch, and at each attempt gasped, "O, doctor,
        give me a little more time." I finally made out a muffled,
        tumultuous heart sound, as if beating under water. The temperature was
        103°, yet there was a great deal of perspiration, urine very scant, no
        thirst, no appetite. He had only slept short naps for many nights. I
        feared the boy was dying. There was a time when I would have treated the
        heart symptoms with <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> or <i><font color="#0000ff">Kalmia</font></i>,
        and the dropsy with <i><font color="#0000ff">Apocynum</font></i>, and
        what not, and so zig-zagged a slow cure or a speedy death. But
        fortunately I knew better now. I knew that every one of these symptoms
        are summed up under one remedy, and covers every point exactly. I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i>
        10x, dose to be given every three hours. I never saw a more brilliant
        cure. The first dose was 7 P. M. I requested that they phone me at 11 P.
        M. that night. At 11 the message came, "Louis is in a drenching
        perspiration, he has urinated quantities, and his breathing is less
        labored." At 8 o'clock the next morning they phoned that he had
        slept peacefully most of the night though still in his upright position
        with chin-strap. That night he could recline in the chair, and the next
        he could lie down in bed. The urine continued in unbelievable
        quantities, the perspiration rained from him, and the swelling promptly
        disappeared. You see what a profound element gold is when homœopathically
        indicated. The lad made a rapid and complete recovery with no other
        medication. He received it first in the 10x, then I rose to the 30th,
        then to 200th, on which I kept him until the poor damaged little heart
        was quite normal again. You will recall that every one of the above
        symptoms are recorded by Hering and Hahnemann in these words&nbsp;:<br>
        "Rheumatism which jumps from joint to joint and finally fastens
        upon the heart. Impossible to lie down. Must sit up bent forward."<br>
        "Visible throbbing of carotids."<br>
        "Face cyanotic, gasps for breath, can hardly speak above a
        whisper."<br>
        "Much perspiration, as in auric fever."<br>
        "Swelling of feet and limbs."<br>
        Does that not picture the little boy just described&nbsp;?<br>
        (Rauterberg.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- I should say it does, and free to add that
        it is one of the best cures in homœopathic literature. No routinist or
        pathological hobby rider would have ever thought of the remedy. Any man
        who could be convinced of the truth of Homœopathy by a few such cures
        is, as Artemus Ward used to say, "<i><font color="#0000ff">A
        obtoose</font></i>." (N.)</p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. E. D., age 81, came to me March 20, 1906, with
        the following history&nbsp;: Her husband had dies suddenly January,
        1906, and she had been brooding over it ever since. Sad, tearful,
        restless, sleepless, moaning, sighing, great sorrow and grief,
        oppression of the chest in cardiac region aggravated by grief and
        motion. The stethoscope reveals aortic regurgitation. Lower legs
        slightly œdematous, sanguine temperament, very lively before, now
        despondent and indifferent to surroundings. <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i>
        1 m. March 24th. oppression of the chest the same as before&nbsp;;
        speaks of death&nbsp;; would like to be with her husband&nbsp;;
        gloominess of mind. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> 50 m.
        Within a week after taking <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i> the
        patient became more "sensible and reasonable." The oppression
        of the chest and œdema vanished. Patient is now well and can walk as
        well as any woman forty years old.<br>
        Here we see the similarity between <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia and
        Aurum</font></i>&nbsp;; the latter is complementary to the former. Still
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> was not the case remedy. The
        unphilosophical mind of <i><font color="#0000ff">Ignatia</font></i> is
        not like that of <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i>. Will the
        "pathological homœopath" tell us if the remedy and the dose
        were in conformity with the cellular derangement in the case&nbsp;? And
        what changes were there present in her brain cells to cause her to be
        temporarily insane&nbsp;? And how much gold is to be found in <i><font color="#0000ff">Aurum</font></i>
        50 m. (R. Del Mas, M. D.)</p>
