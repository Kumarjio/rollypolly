        <p align="CENTER">BAPTISIA TINCTORIA</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Reading in Kent's Materia Medica his very good
        description of the sore and ulcerated condition of the mucous membranes
        generally of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>, my mind
        reverted to a case which came under my care while in New York giving my
        annual course of lectures. A physician was taken ill and sent for me.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY"><a name="21"></a>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="CENTER">THREATENED TYPHOID FEVER</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 21</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I found that for weeks he had been under the pressure
        of more than usual amount of business, been complaining of general
        lassitude&nbsp;: a tired feeling from which he could not get rested.
        When I called he had taken to his bed, and now there was superadded a
        headache, general aching and restless, temperature of 103° and pulse
        quickened correspondingly. Thinking I had a case of La Grippe on hand,
        and that these symptoms pointed so far as clearly to <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>
        as I could judge, it was given. But the next day there was no
        improvement apparent and he complained of his mouth feeling sore. There
        was some dryness of the tongue, but not much&nbsp;; while the buccal
        cavity seemed sore and inclined to be slimy. There was not much thirst.
        Another symptom now came out in great prominence, viz., great desire for
        cold air, especially when lying down&nbsp;; must be propped up in bed,
        and, although it was cold winter weather, they had to leave the windows
        wide open. He wanted the wind right in his face. The nurse had to wear
        her wraps, as though out of doors.<br>
        Now <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> was given with
        confidence, but brought no relief, and the mouth and breath had become
        horribly offensive from the ulcerated condition that had developed.
        There was no cough and the respiratory murmur was distinct in the lungs.
        The urine was dark and offensive, but there was no trouble with the
        abdomen or bowels as yet. Still thinking the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        ought to be good I interpolated a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        and continued it (the <i><font color="#0000ff">Puls</font></i>.) a day
        longer. The mouth made me think of <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>
        and then I called to mind that in the old provings of Burt that
        opposition of breathing was <i><font color="#0000ff">markedly present</font></i>
        in the case of Dr. J. S. Douglas (the prover).<br>
        I went down into the office and read it in "Allen's Encyclopædia
        of Pure Materia Medica" as follows&nbsp;: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Awoke
        with great difficulty of breathing, the lungs felt tight and compressed</font></i>.
        Could not get a full breath&nbsp;; felt obliged to open the window to
        get his face to fresh air ... (Symptom 232. Again, Symp. 234). On lying
        down difficulty of breathing, in half an hour becoming so great that he
        was obliged to rise, etc."<br>
        That looked so like my patient&nbsp;; and the condition of the mouth,
        prostration, etc., corresponding, I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>
        200th in water (Alpha Sigma preparation).<br>
        The effect was magical. The breathing became easy and all the other
        symptoms promptly subsided without any other medicine. Of course, it
        took some days to recover from the weakness.<br>
        The above symptoms quoted from Allen are starred. So it seems that some
        one else had already verified them, though this was the first time I had
        done so. What is the lesson&nbsp;?<br>
        1st. That this symptom is again verified.<br>
        2nd. That although only one out of twelve provers had recorded it, it
        was <i><font color="#0000ff">genuine</font></i> and the clinical test
        proved it.<br>
        Our Materia Medica has often been called a mass of rubbish by those who
        have no patience nor skill in using it. While it is undoubtedly true
        that there are many symptoms there that are not reliable, we shall never
        know which they are until clinical experimentation settles it.<br>
        Hering called <i><font color="#0000ff">Agaricus, Lycopodium</font></i>
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Thuja</font></i> "over proved
        drugs." I am not so sure of it&nbsp;; and many years with <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
        has gone far to convince me to the contrary.<br>
        Now proving and re-proving is the cry of many in our school, and while I
        would not offer one objection to this, I would suggest that the work of <i><font color="#0000ff">verification</font></i>
        of provings already made, or partly made, go on with redoubled
        diligence, for I have in difficult cases repeatedly found among the
        symptoms not as yet verified in our <i><font color="#0000ff">Materia
        Medica</font></i> the key to the remedy for the whole case. (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 22</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Nov. 8, was called to see a child 5 years old,
        suffering from sore mouth. The roof of the mouth and the tongue were
        covered with small ulcers. An abundance of saliva flowed from the mouth,
        the tongue was covered over with a thick white exceedingly moist coat,
        the edges being red. Breath fetid. I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>
        and waited five days. At the end of this time I could see no perceptible
        improvement. I therefore studied the case anew. In <i><font color="#0000ff">Hering's
        condensed Materia Medica</font></i>, under <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>,
        I found the following symptoms, all of which agreed with the patient's
        condition&nbsp;:<br>
        Putrid ulceration of buccal cavity with salivation, well developed
        ulcers.<br>
        Gums loose, flabby, dark red and fetid.<br>
        Fauces dark red&nbsp;; putrid ulcers, can swallow liquids only. Tongue
        white, with red papillæ, the edges red and shining.<br>
        I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i> 1 m, and in three
        days the whole trouble had disappeared. (W. M. James.)</p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. B. has been feeling poorly for two or three days.
        This morning he had a severe chill. I was called at 5 P. M. I find the
        following symptoms&nbsp;:<br>
        Aching in the muscles and bones&nbsp;; aching from head to foot&nbsp;;
        bed as hard as a board&nbsp;; "<i><font color="#0000ff">pillow hard
        as a rock."</font></i><br>
        Coughing large quantities or rusty sputa&nbsp;; stitching pain in left
        chest, has to hold his chest with his hands (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bry.,
        Mer</font></i>.), <i><font color="#0000ff">fan-like motion of alæ nasi</font></i>
        (<i><font color="#0000ff">Phos., Lyc</font></i>.).<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Stupid and sleepy</font></i>, could hardly keep
        awake&nbsp;; total loss of appetite&nbsp;; very thirsty for large drinks
        of water&nbsp;; cough worse at night&nbsp;; several stools per day -
        very offensive&nbsp;; wanted to keep very still, as the least movement
        aggravated his cough and pain in the chest (<i><font color="#0000ff">Bry</font></i>.).<br>
        Temp. first evening, 101°&nbsp;; pulse, 110&nbsp;; respiration, 32. The
        second evening, temp., 103°&nbsp;; pulse, 120&nbsp;; resp., 40. Third
        day, eight A. M., temp., 99°&nbsp;; pulse, 88&nbsp;; resp., 28. <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>
        8 m. m. (Swan)&nbsp;; needed no other medicine. (Sherbin.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- I wish we had time and space to report more
        cures of my own and others with this most wonderful remedy. I do not
        know of many remedies with such a short proving that are more reliable.
        Surely this is not an over-proved remedy. I believe we do not yet know
        half its virtues. (N.)</p>
