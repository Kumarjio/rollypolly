        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. E. G., æt. 36, had been given up to die by her
        family physician.<br>
        She came of a consumptive family, her mother and her mother's parents
        having died with the disease. She had always menstruated VERY PROFUSELY,
        and after having practiced upon herself, within the course of eight or
        nine years, no less than seven abortions, her menses assumed the type of
        recurrent hæmorrhages. Her lungs had always been very sensitive&nbsp;;
        has had more or less cough&nbsp;; at first DRY and HACKING, later loose
        and hollow. Has had pneumonia twice, making a tardy recovery each time.
        At present was convalescing from a third and severe attack of pneumonia,
        when some imprudence on her part brought about an unfavourable change,
        and she failed so rapidly that her case seemed hopeless.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">SYMPTOMS. Constant hollow, loose cough, extreme <i><font color="#0000ff">sensitiveness
        of the lungs to cold air and to far&nbsp;; profuse</font></i> and
        general <i><font color="#0000ff">perspiration at night</font></i>, of a
        sour smell. <i><font color="#0000ff">Extreme</font></i> emaciation,
        constipation alternating with <i><font color="#0000ff">watery diarrhœa&nbsp;;
        great despondency</font></i>&nbsp;; constant <i><font color="#0000ff">passive
        hæmorrhage from the uterus</font></i> of dark foul blood. <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea
        carb</font></i>. 30 was the first and only remedy prescribed. Under its
        use she not only made a good recovery from this attack, but regained by
        its long continued use a surprising degree of general health. (Arndt.)</p>

        few weeks past had what her doctor called cholera infantum. All sorts of
        foods had been tried until now, when they called me in, the diarrhœa,
        of a <i><font color="#0000ff">sour smell</font></i> and light colored,
        was almost incessant&nbsp;; every diaper. There was also frequent
        vomiting of <i><font color="#0000ff">sour</font></i> substance and the
        milk came up in very large curds. There was great emaciation and child
        when it slept did so with half open eyes, and the sweat on the head wet
        the pillow far around. I put <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea carb</font></i>.
        6m. (Jenichen) in the child's food, as suggested by Dr. Hering, and in a
        few days marked improvement set in and continued until the patient was

        W., a lad aged 10, blue eyes, light thin hair, pale, thin face and of a
        scrofulous disposition. One year previous to my call a periostitis set
        up in the shaft of the left tibia upon the inner side. Case as presented
        to me the first time&nbsp;; bone has exfoliated along the whole length
        of the shaft&nbsp;; ulcer is so deep that not more than one-half of the
        supporting structure remains and leg is much bent&nbsp;; ulcer keeps up
        a continuous discharge which has left little vital resource behind.
        Patient is not only badly <i><font color="#0000ff">emaciated</font></i>,
        but has a hectic fever and a bad cough, with <i><font color="#0000ff">dullness
        in the right apex</font></i>. Cough is <i><font color="#0000ff">dry</font></i>
        and harasses him in <i><font color="#0000ff">the evening&nbsp;; has
        night sweats</font></i>. Was given <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea
        carbonica</font></i> 6, and urged to use milk freely as a diet, to which
        added the amount of three tablespoonfuls of brandy every twenty-four
        hours. Ulcers were fully healed and bone reparation complete within the
        next twelve months. All traces of lung trouble also passed away and I
        have never known of subsequent trouble, though case passed from my
        observation in the course of half a dozen years. We will here add that
        we have many times succeeded in curing these bone ulcers, commonly
        called "fever sores," with the use of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea
        carb</font></i>., milk and brandy, and they all remain cured so far as
        we know. (G. N. Brigham.)<br>
        I do not think that so much stress need be placed upon the milk and
        brandy. With other nourishing diet the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>
        would have cured just the same. I made just as remarkable a cure of
        caries with <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea hypophos</font></i>.
        without the use of the stimulant. (N.) (See Leaders in Hom.
        Therapeutics, 3rd. E., page 241.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Eddie D., 18 months old. Oct. 30, 1881, the mother
        brought him to me, saying she had done all she could, and now desired me
        to treat him, if I thought I could do him any good.<br>
        The child was pale, flabby and very weak&nbsp;; has pale blue eyes and
        golden hair&nbsp;; had diarrhœa three months, which nothing could stop.
        According to the mother's ingenuity, "He's a <i><font color="#0000ff">good</font></i>
        child and never cries much." Was eating a biscuit when his mother
        entered the office with him. I told her the child was forming a bad
        habit. She immediately answered, "I must always carry something for
        him to eat wherever I go, because he wants to eat <i><font color="#0000ff">all
        the time</font></i>, and <i><font color="#0000ff">he just loves eggs,
        but</font></i> I don't know whether he ought to have them or not&nbsp;;
        they make his bowels run off, and he takes a very bad spell once a
        month. I have noticed it now three times."<br>
        Question&nbsp;: What time of the month&nbsp;?<br>
        Answer&nbsp;: When the moon fulls.<br>
        I noticed a watery coryza and rattling in the chest. Every time the
        mother opened her mouth I thought more of <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>,
        which I gave in the 85m potency, one dose, dry on the tongue, in the
        office, and thirteen powders of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>.,
        a powder to be dissolved in a half glass of water, and a teaspoonful to
        be given every two hours. The mother desired to know about letting him
        have the eggs. I told her that his craving for them would gradually
        decrease, and that I could not withhold them from him.<br>
        November 14. Much better in every respect. "He does not crave eggs
        quite so much and his bowels are better, but he cannot <i><font color="#0000ff">walk
        yet</font></i>." I told her she should not expect the child to be
        entirely well in two weeks, when it had been sick three months.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>., 13 powders to be taken in
        the same manner.<br>
        Dec. 9. Still improving. Is beginning to walk again and does not crave
        eggs any more, though he likes to eat them. Mother thinks his bowels are
        natural now. I could detect no rattling in the chest, and nose had
        stopped running.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac. lac</font></i>., nine powders. Told the
        mother she need not come back unless the child got worse, and then to
        let me know immediately. I have heard from the child repeatedly and he
        is still "hearty." (Tom Hagen.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">1. Deficient or irregular bone development (wide open
        or partly closing fontanelles), crooked spine, deformed extremities.<br>
        2. Leucophlegmatic constitution or temperament. (Fair, fat, flabby).<br>
        3. Coldness, general and local&nbsp;; objective and subjective,
        especially as if had on cold, damp stockings&nbsp;; affections from
        working in cold water.<br>
        4. Sweats general (night sweats and on exertion). Local&nbsp;: Head
        (children) axillæ, hands, feet, etc.<br>
        5. Digestive tract sour (sour taste, eructations, vomiting sour curds,
        diarrhœa).<br>
        6. Great debility&nbsp;; cannot walk far or ascend stairs or hill for
        shortness of breath&nbsp;; easily strained by lifting.<br>
        7. <i><font color="#0000ff">Modalities</font></i>&nbsp;: &lt; In cold
        air, ascending or exertion, straining&nbsp;; from profuse menses to
        which she is subject.<br>
        This is another one of the medicinal agents which but for the provings
        and potentizing process of Hahnemann's would have remained comparatively
        unknown.<br>
        If we were to judge by the number of disease affections named in
        "Clarke's Dictionary" and "Hering's Guiding
        Symptoms", it would seem as if it must be a veritable
        panacea&nbsp;; and if homœopathic therapeutists were guided by
        pathological names it would be true.<br>
        But when we recognize that the characteristic symptoms, both subjective
        and objective, must lead to its selection, it becomes apparent at once
        that while the remedy may be applicable to each or all of these
        affections, it may, on the other hand, not fit one of them. This is the
        true spirit of homœopathy, and anyone who ignores or don't understand
        it must of necessity become a routinist or a bungler in prescribing. It
        seems appropriate here to call attention to the fact that while the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea</font></i>
        combinations have their family resemblances, they also have their
        peculiarities. For instance, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea carb</font></i>.
        subject has an abnormal desire for eggs, while the <i><font color="#0000ff">Calcarea
        phos</font></i>. one desires bacon or <i><font color="#0000ff">ham rind</font></i>.
        Of course, it is not the domain of this work to make exhaustive
        differentiations, but they <i><font color="#0000ff">must</font></i> be
        made or indifferent success is the result.</p>
