        <p align="JUSTIFY">Wm. T., aged 23 occupation clerk, consulted me,
        complaining of an impairment of speech, which had lasted seventeen
        years. No cause could be learned, although his mother and others had
        been interviewed. The case as taken presented the following&nbsp;:<br>
        February 16. Mentally he is weak indifferent for the most part, with
        times of irritation and petulance. Aphonia &lt; between 4 and 5 P. M.,
        at which time the voice is the merest whisper&nbsp;; &lt; in hot
        weather&nbsp;; &lt; in winter, &gt; by expectoration of a lump of black
        mucus. Three and a half years ago he had typhoid fever under allopathic
        treatment, since which time he is "nervous" with trembling of
        both arms. This is quite independent of whether or not he works.<br>
        Voice lost in the evening, <i><font color="#0000ff">Brom., Carb. v.,
        Phos</font></i>.<br>
        &lt; in winter, <i><font color="#0000ff">Carb. veg., phos</font></i>.<br>
        &lt; in wet weather, <i><font color="#0000ff">carb. v., Phos.</font></i><br>
        &lt; 4 and 5 P. M., <i><font color="#0000ff">Carb. v</font></i>.<br>
        Indifferent, apathetic mentally, <i><font color="#0000ff">Carb. v., Phos</font></i>.<br>
        &gt; by expectoration of black mucus disregarded, as this is Pittsburgh.<br>
        February 18. Gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo veg</font></i>. 1 m.
        single dose.<br>
        February 25. Improving, has some voice P. M., S. L.<br>
        March 27. Improvement continued until a week ago. Repeated <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo
        veg</font></i>., this time 40m.<br>
        April 25. Practically well. Thinks it is wonderful since time and money
        had been spent. (Richard Blackmore.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">TYPHOID FEVER</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 65</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">During the terrible epidemic of typhoid fever in
        Ithaca a few years ago I was called in consultation in fours cases. One
        of the worst was as follows&nbsp;: After I had seen three light cases
        with the physician who called me, we were walking on the street and met
        a man who shook hands with the doctor&nbsp;; introduced me to him, and
        the inquired of him about another case (his niece). He answered, there
        is no hope. Two physicians have just left her to die. Dr. E. then told
        him that I was there to counsel him. Well, said the man, my brother is
        poor, but if your doctor will see her I will pay the bill. She was
        certainly in an apparently hopeless condition. She had had no movement
        of the bowels for fourteen days, notwithstanding old school cathartics
        in abundance, and they had informed the family that the bowels were
        paralyzed and would never move again. The abdomen was enormously
        distended. She laid upon her back with her knees propped up. She was
        cold, and pulse flickering and weak&nbsp;; hippocratic face, and they
        were fanning her to try to give her breath. There was no restlessness
        like Arsenicum. She was past that. In answer to the doctor's look, I
        said there was but one small chance left, and I felt it. We dissolved
        some pellets of <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo. veg</font></i>. 200 in
        water, with directions to give a teaspoonful once in two hours, and let
        us know if she was alive in the morning. She was alive in the morning
        and better, and under the remedy the bowels moved naturally in a couple
        of days, the tympany rapidly gave way. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Carbo.
        veg</font></i>. was followed by <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
        200, and the girl recovered.<br>
        Another case with profuse hæmorrhages and the characteristic <i><font color="#0000ff">paleness</font></i>
        of the whole body also recovered. (Nash).<br>
        No stimulants were used. The best stimulant is the homœopathic remedy.<br>
        The symptoms and conditions calling for that remedy are, no matter what
        the name of the disease, well represented in the following&nbsp;:</p>
        <b><font color="#000080">
        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#000080">RÉSUMÉ</font></b><br>
        1. Vital force nearly exhausted, complete collapse.<br>
        2. Blood stagnates in the capillaries&nbsp;; venous turgescence&nbsp;;
        surface cold and blue.<br>
        3. Hæmorrhages (nose, stomach, gums, bowels, bladder or any mucous
        surface) with great PALENESS of the whole surface of the body.<br>
        4. Mucous membranes break down, become spongy, bleed, ulcerate and
        become putrid.<br>
        5. Excessive flatulence, stomach and abdomen, pressing upward (<i><font color="#0000ff">Asaf</font></i>.).<br>
        6. Hunger for oxygen&nbsp;; decarbonized blood&nbsp;; cries fan
        me&nbsp;; fan me <i><font color="#0000ff">hard</font></i>.<br>
        7. Anæmia, especially after acute diseases, which have greatly
        debilitated the patient.</p>
