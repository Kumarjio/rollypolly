        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Dr. Keese was attacked with a severe
        inflammatory rheumatism of the knee. The swelling was very red and
        painful. There was high temperature, quick pulse, great restlessness and
        exceeding sensitiveness to the pain.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i> brought very little if any
        relief, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i> next on account
        of the &lt; on movement and great thirst suffered like defeat. Now (said
        the patient) why don't you help me&nbsp;? I know you can if you have a
        mind to. That was flattering, and I naturally wanted to "make
        good." I turned down the bed clothes to view the situation. As I
        put out my hand to feel of the knee, she exclaimed in terror, Oh&nbsp;!
        don't touch it. The least <i><font color="#0000ff">touch is unbearable
        and brings on the pain for hours</font></i>.<br>
        I said you hold still, and put my hand carefully on the inflamed knee
        and gradually increased the pressure until I pressed it hard and firm.
        The patient looked astonished and ashamed as she said why, doctor, that
        don't hurt me, but I tell you that the least touch has put me in agony
        before. I took off the pressure as gradually as I had put it on, and the
        usual severe &lt; did not follow. She then got <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
        200th, and when I visited her twenty-four hours later she exclaimed,
        there, I knew you could help me if you wanted to. No other remedy was
        needed. (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img height="281" alt="Dr Frederick H. LUTZE (1838-1924)" src="./CINCHONA - The Testimony of the Clinic - By Eugene Beauharnais NASH_files/lutzef01.jpg" width="204" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">Chas.
        P., a tailor, came to see me at the dispensary, having suffered a long
        time from facial neuralgia. Had been treated by several old school
        doctors, but each one after treating for some time with remedies and
        liniments with hardly any relief told him that he would have to be
        operated on to have the diseased nerve cut out, as it was the only way
        he could ever be cured. This was to him always a signal to try another
        doctor, as he did not relish the idea of an operation. He had been so
        long unable to work and had spent all his savings for doctors and drugs
        that he was now compelled to try the free dispensary.<br>
        The pain was entirely on the left side of the face and neck. It would
        come and shoot through the face like lightning, especially in the house,
        especially if the tried to sew on the machine, or the children made any
        noise. The only relief he could get was by walking slowly about in the
        open air. He could only sleep after applying cloths, wet with cold
        water, to the left side of the face and head&nbsp;; when these got warm
        the pains would awaken him, but on re-applying them he could go to sleep
        again. The relief from cold, open air and slow motion decided me to give
        him <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> c. m., but all in
        vain.<br>
        I then assured him he must be mistaken about his symptoms, for, if
        correct, I thought he ought to have been cured, but he persisted that he
        had given his symptoms correctly, and continued&nbsp;: "If I only
        touch my nose or cheek ever so slightly, thus," suiting the action
        to the word, "I can bring on that pain," and the expression of
        his face and his groans showed that he had been more than successful. He
        was still worse from any noise indoors, heat, lying on the left side of
        the face and from eating, better from fresh open air, walking slowly and
        from cold in general. Stools daily, but almost black, urine dark yellow.
        I now gave him <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> 200, to take
        one powder mornings and evenings. After three days he returned,
        saying&nbsp;: "I have had no more neuralgia since taking the second
        powder, and have slept well every night since without the cold cloths.
        You are the thirteenth doctor who has treated me for this, but the only
        one who has cured me." (F. H. Lutze.)<br>
        These two cases illustrate the unexplainable symptoms - <i><font color="#0000ff">light
        touch &lt; while hard pressure &gt;</font></i>, and in the latter case
        notwithstanding the apparently strong indications for <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>&nbsp;;
        but notice that the black stools and yellow urine belong to <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
        and not to <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>. (N.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 40</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">J. Hall, a young man, unmarried, has had for a long
        time great bloating of the abdomen, with severe paroxysms of colic. When
        I was called to him he had been in bed some time, a number of days, as
        the colic and bloating was getting worse continually. He was a dark
        complexioned, medium height and build, dark hair and eyes. He was
        jaundiced and had a yellow, watery diarrhœa, which passed with much
        flatus, but did not relieve the pain or reduce the size of the abdomen.
        The abdomen was as full as that of a woman ready to be confined&nbsp;;
        very tympanitic, and the convolutions of the whole length of the colon
        bulged out so that they could be seen as well as felt through the thin
        abdominal wall, for he was quite emaciated generally. He laid
        straightened out on the bed on his back, except when the painful
        paroxysms came on, when he would throw himself about in agony and groan.<br>
        I tried various remedies, among which were <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynth.,
        Arsenicum, Nux vomica</font></i>, and finally <i><font color="#0000ff">Dioscorea</font></i>,
        which I thought would certainly relieve him, because he <i><font color="#0000ff">bent
        backward</font></i> instead of doubled up with the pain, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Dioscorea</font></i>
        is a great flatulent remedy, and had served me well in such cases. <i><font color="#0000ff">China,
        Carbo v.</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopod</font></i>. had
        also been tried. They were all used in the 30th and below. But no good
        from any of them. It was a poor family, and the mother being worn out
        with night watching (no nurse to help her) fell asleep, and the patient
        became delirious with the pain and escaped from the bed, and in his
        night clothes was overtaken three miles from home and taken back. Of
        course, things got serious, but they had one advantage, they were too
        poor to change doctors or to pay for an operation of any kind. Well, as
        has been my custom, I sat down and studied up the case again. Nearly all
        his symptoms called for <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>. But
        he had had <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> low. Now the only
        thing to do was to try it high. What, in such a desperate case&nbsp;?
        Yep. Only thing to do. So I gave him some <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
        5m. made on my own potentizer (so I knew what it was). The result was
        all a Lippe could desire. The terrible pain grew promptly but gradually
        less, the tympany gradually subsided, the diarrhœa stopped, and in a
        month from its first administration he was working on the road with the
        rest of his fellow laborers. There was no return. Now there was a very
        prominent subjective symptom in the case which I have not mentioned. As
        H. N. Guernsey used to give it&nbsp;: "Uncomfortable distention in
        the abdomen, with a wish to belch up, or <i><font color="#0000ff">sensation
        as though the abdomen were packed full</font></i>, not in the least
        relieved by eructations." In this case neither belching nor stool
        relieved in the least. (Nash.)</p>

        R., age 65, had been treated during five or six years at different times
        by two homœopaths for <i><font color="#0000ff">torpid liver</font></i>.
        During all this time she had not had a natural evacuation, the stool had
        to be washed out by an enema&nbsp;; there had not been the least desire
        for stool, nor any urging.<br>
        She had become very feeble and emaciated and suffered frequently and
        severely from neuralgia on the right side of the face, which the
        treatment of her physicians did not seem to relieve. An allopath being
        called in gave her a lengthy prescription, containing <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine,
        Strychnia, Aloe, Podophyllum, Euonymus</font></i>, etc., to be made into
        pills to take two mornings and evenings. The first dose aggravated her
        so much that she did not take the second dose until the following
        morning&nbsp;; this making her still worse, the pills were abandoned and
        I was called. I found her delirious, temperature 104 degrees, but could
        obtain no symptoms.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vom</font></i>. 200, given at bed-time,
        produced a favourable change by next morning, but in the evening
        neuralgia of right side of head and face appeared, with symptoms of <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellad</font></i>.,
        and this soon relieved the neuralgia, as also another attack a month
        later. During the interval and after the second attack she was treated
        according to symptoms, but after two months the neuralgia made its
        appearance again&nbsp;; this time on the left side of the head, face and
        neck, with exactly the same symptoms, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellad</font></i>.
        gave no relief whatever&nbsp;; she was rather worse in the afternoon.
        Mrs. R. then told me that the <i><font color="#0000ff">slightest touch</font></i>
        would not only aggravate the pain, but actually reproduce it in its
        worst form, if touched when she was free from it. <i><font color="#0000ff">Chin.
        sulph</font></i>. covering all the symptoms, including the reproduction
        of pain by touch, which is not found under <i><font color="#0000ff">Bellad</font></i>.,
        I gave her a dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Chin. sulph</font></i>.
        45m in water, to take two teaspoonfuls every two hours, which gradually
        improved her, so that she was free from pain in four hours and never had
        another attack of neuralgia. (F. H. Lutze, 1893.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">SYMPTOMS. Paroxysm commenced 8 A. M., hard and

        200, ten powders, one every three hours. Speedy recovery followed. (T.
        D. Stowe.)<br>
        I cannot take more time with this great remedy, although I could
        multiply many cases of intermittents cured with it in the potencies. J.
        C. Roberts gives seven cases cured with it in the 87m in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i>
        (Journal), Vol. III, page 236. Dr. Roberts comments thus&nbsp;: "I
        think that these few cases should convince those gentlemen of the errors
        of their ways who insist upon it that the giving of <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>
        is necessary in order "<i><font color="#0000ff">to break the
        chills.</font></i>"<br>
        "These cases were considered incurable, but they were cured in the
        malarial region in which they took the fever, and in which they
        continued to reside after having been cured without having a return of
        the fever."<br>
        The <i><font color="#0000ff">Cinchona</font></i>, as well as its
        alkaloid, has been well proved and can be applied in potency with great
        success in the cure of intermittents if the symptoms indicate. If it is
        not indicated it will, like other not indicated remedies, not cure and
        the <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i> in massive doses will
        only suppress temporarily and establish a <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>
        cachexia often more difficult to cure than the original disease.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac, Arsenicum, Natrum mur., Pulsatilla,
        Ignatia, Eupatorium</font></i> and many other remedies can each cure
        case that Quinine cannot touch in the way of a permanent cure. I have
        written more at length upon this drug here, in hopes that some allopath,
        or only-in-name homœopath, may profit thereby. The treatment of
        intermittents is a good field in which to demonstrate the power and
        truth of the single remedy, the similimum and the minimum dose. And
        intermittents is only a small part of the field of operation where this
        valuable drug in its two forms is wonderfully efficacious. (N.)</p>
