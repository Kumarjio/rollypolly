        <p align="JUSTIFY">A boy had scarlatina. On the twelfth and thirteenth
        day from the appearance of the rash he had swelling of the right hand
        and fingers, with scanty, high-colored urine. <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>
        c. m. (Fincke) every four hours for four doses. Next day hand nearly
        well, urine freer and paler. Recovered. Forty-one remedies are given by
        Bœnninghausen and Jahr under "Swelling of the hands." This
        list does not include <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i> or
        other recently proved remedies. Neither the swelling nor the
        highly-colored, scanty urine is diagnostic of any one remedy, being
        found under many. Shall we theorize, pathologically, and argue that as
        the kidneys were the source of the mischief we must direct our efforts
        to the establishment of their secretion&nbsp;? If so, what shall we
        give&nbsp;? Shall it be <i><font color="#0000ff">Digital</font></i>. or <i><font color="#0000ff">Apis</font></i>
        or <i><font color="#0000ff">Terebinth</font></i>.&nbsp;? All, and many
        more, act on the kidneys. No, the homœopathic physician takes note of
        apparently insignificant symptoms, which to the pathologist (only) are
        of no value, because he cannot explain them. In this case the <i><font color="#0000ff">right</font></i>
        hand and fingers were swollen.<br>
        This symptom is of no importance to the pathologist&nbsp;; what does it
        matter to him whether the right hand or the left is swollen in
        post-scarlatinal dropsy&nbsp;? The homœopathic physician, however,
        finds out that only five of the above forty-one have "Swelling of
        the <i><font color="#0000ff">right</font></i> hand", <i><font color="#0000ff">Digit.,
        Hepar. Lycop., Nat. mur</font></i>., and <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosph</font></i>.,
        and of these only <i><font color="#0000ff">Digit</font></i>. has in the
        same symptoms, "Swelling of <i><font color="#0000ff">right hand and
        fingers</font></i>." Another peculiarity unexplainable to the
        pathologist.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Phos</font></i>. has indeed swelling of right
        index finger as well as the hand, but here the swelling becomes black
        and gangrenous, which is a contra-indication.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. sol</font></i>. has swelling of <i><font color="#0000ff">left</font></i>
        hand, and <i><font color="#0000ff">Cactus</font></i> œdema of <i><font color="#0000ff">both</font></i>
        hands, <i><font color="#0000ff">worse</font></i> in the left.

        <p align="CENTER">DROPSY</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 81</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In 1865 I was called to a man, Mr. Matthewson, aged
        about 80 years, who was sitting upright in his chair because he could
        not breathe lying down. He was a man who did not like to call a doctor,
        so had come to a very bad state at this time. I found hydrothorax, of
        course, and his lower limbs were greatly swollen and very hard, but
        readily pit on pressure, and stay pitted a long time after. Dark red,
        almost purple spots had appeared on the lower legs, as if the tissues
        were about to become gangrenous. Heart action very weak, at times very
        slow, and again at times rapid, irregular and intermitting. Respiration
        very difficult&nbsp;; could not lie down&nbsp;; had sat in his chair for
        three weeks. Suffocative constriction, distressing dyspnœa, wants to
        get a long breath, and, on account of the effusion in the chest, heart
        sounds very muffled. Urine very scanty and red. The diagnosis was, of
        course, cardiac dropsy. But referring to Allen's Encyclopædia it will
        be seen that <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i> covered all
        the heart symptoms. I gave it first in the potency (30) then lower,
        finally drop doses of the fluid extract. No result. The patient then
        expressed a wish to see an eclectic physician. So I brought him in. He
        looked him over, and on the way home I said, Well, doctor, what shall we
        give that man to cure him&nbsp;? He looked at me resentfully, and
        exclaimed, Do you think I am a fool&nbsp;? No, I replied, I thought you
        knew something or I would not have brought you down here. Well, said he,
        you know this man will die within two weeks if you know anything. I
        didn't say. But I went home, went up to the drug store and procured some
        powdered digitalis leaves, made a 1st decimal trituration, and said to
        myself, we'll see what a decoction will do, and, old man, you either die
        or get well on this. I put up some one grain powders and told the nurse
        (his wife) to put one in the bottom of a teacup and pour the cup half
        full of hot water and let it stand an hour, and then let him drink it,
        and repeat once in two hours. Next day he was worse apparently&nbsp;;
        thought he <i><font color="#0000ff">felt</font></i> a little better. The
        next day the urine increased and soon became very profuse, and all his
        symptoms rapidly subsided. Then the interval between powders was
        increased to two hours, four hours, eight hours, twelve hours,
        twenty-four hours, etc., and finally left off altogether. In one month
        he came up town, nearly a mile, and carried home a bushel of cornmeal on
        his shoulder. I met him a few months after and jokingly said to him,
        Well, old man, aren't you ever going to die, can't anything kill
        you&nbsp;? Well, said he, I don't know, I guess not&nbsp;; you tried <i><font color="#0000ff">your</font></i>
        best. There was never any return of the dropsy, and he lived seven years
        after and died of old age simply, as near as I could diagnose. (Nash.)<br>
        I have in several other similar cases seen this decoction of <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i>
        do good work when the fluid extract in old school hands failed, also
        when the potencies and alcoholic preparations failed.<br>
        I prescribed upon the <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i> above
        named and cured the man, whatever the pathology of the case.<br>
        In the Hahnemann Monthly (Journal), A. D. 1871, page 171, is an article
        from the pen of our ever beloved and honored Constantine Hering, which
        is entitled "The Great Desideratum."<br>
        In my opinion it is a masterpiece which should be reproduced often and
        never lost sight of. Want of space forbids quoting it entire in these
        pages, but I will, I hope, be pardoned for making somewhat lengthy
        quotations from the same.<br>
        "In 1844 there appeared in the A. H. Z., Vol. 27, page 1, a very
        elaborate treatise on the homœopathic treatment of endocarditis, by
        Clotar Mueller. To the symptoms obtained by the provings he has added,
        not without skill and great ingenuity, the symptoms of percussion and
        auscultation, according to the cures reported. Iback and Tinks in their
        Handbook had just commenced to astonish the homœopathic word by their
        readymade <i><font color="#0000ff">'labels'</font></i> containing, in
        technical terms, the constitution, temperaments, and all the undefined
        general characteristics of many of our drugs. These labels were eagerly
        translated and copied into an 'original' big book on materia medica&nbsp;;
        and now many years after they pass for essentials in Hughes' Text Book.
        Yes, finding their way event into Burt's 'Characteristics'". Such
        "labels" we can best liken to the red and blue flowers growing
        in wheat fields. When the grain is harvested and prepared to yield such
        flour as we made bread of they are separated and thrown on the
        dung-hill. Sure observations live forever.<br>
        Cl. Mueller must have had a foreboding of this, for he says on page
        57&nbsp;: "Next to <i><font color="#0000ff">Digitalis</font></i> no
        other remedy deserves a new proving as much as <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>,
        that is, a proving having for its object the auscultatory symptoms. Such
        a proving would give with the very extraordinary specific influences <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>
        has on the heart a great many more decisive and more certain
        results."<br>
        It bothers our learned author not a little that according to the cures
        made by homœopathicians <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>
        had shown itself of great use in pericarditis, in all the stages of
        endocarditis, even the far progressed, in valvular diseases of different
        kinds in hypertrophy, and, alas, also in dilatations. He wished, like
        Watzke, in the Vienna provings of <i><font color="#0000ff">Colocynthis,
        Aconite</font></i>, etc., to have such symptoms as would, above all,
        enable him to put <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i> into one
        of the drawers of the sideboard invented by the pathologists of the late
        period.<br>
        In Edwin M. Hale's "Lectures on Diseases of the Heart", 1871,
        on page 88, we find the following remark&nbsp;: "<i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>
        is an important remedy in pericarditis, but the provings were conducted
        with such disregard for physical or objective symptoms, or even correct
        subjective symptoms, that it is difficult to define clearly its curative
        sphere." By "curative sphere" the author cannot mean
        anything else but those above mentioned drawers in the sideboard.<br>
        There was no difficulty whatever to "define clearly" the
        effect of a number of herbs proved in a hurry, by a few, who were at the
        same time in a hurry to cure sick people with indigenous plants. The
        reason why there is such a difficulty here to "define the
        sphere", and to define it "clearly", <i><font color="#0000ff">is
        only because it will not fit in the drawers</font></i>. And why does it
        not&nbsp;? There are too many symptoms, and there is a want of such as
        the author requires to "define the sphere".<br>
        But there is a school of medicine founded by a certain Hahnemann, who
        laid down as a main principle to <i><font color="#0000ff">select the
        curative drug, according to symptoms, not according to spheres</font></i>.
        Now it happened that <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i> had
        been given according to the corroborated and characteristic symptoms,
        not only in so many different diseases of the heart, but also in
        inflammatory diseases of the brain, the eyes, the lungs, in neuralgias
        of the eye, the face, the shoulders, the feet, etc., also in catarrh of
        the stomach, in affections from worms, and even for squinting. <i><font color="#0000ff">Well,
        we have to put the heart or the worms in the centre of the sphere</font></i>.<br>
        Then Hering goes on to give quite an extensive history of the provings
        of <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>. After that is done we
        quote again&nbsp;: "But what is the great <i><font color="#0000ff">desideratum</font></i>
        so ardently desired, from Cl. Mueller in 1844 down to the 'Lectures on
        Diseases of the Heart', in 1871&nbsp;? It has been repeatedly said
        during a quarter of a century that the provers ought to get
        "auscultatory symptoms." This was said first by one, then by
        two, three and so on, and now it has become what some call 'a public
        opinion', an opinion of the majority. Let anyone read the words (V. II.,
        p. 390) in Shipman's Grauvogl (and all ought to have it), "Assent
        becomes a duty."<br>
        What is commonly called <i><font color="#0000ff">public opinion</font></i>
        is, plainly speaking, the opinion of two or three persons, and we should
        convince ourselves of the truth of this, could we but see into the mode
        in which this public opinion originated. We should then find that there
        are two or three people who first assumed or decided or affirmed that
        such and such a thing was so without taking the trouble very thoroughly
        to examine it. Taking for granted that these had sufficient capacity of
        judgment, a few others also accepted their opinions&nbsp;; three again
        are believed by many others, whose indolence rather inclines them to
        believe it at once than to take the trouble to test it. Thus grows from
        day to day the number of such indolent, easily believing
        adherents&nbsp;; for if the opinion had only gained a goodly number of
        advocates, those who adopted it afterwards attributed its prosperity to
        the quasi fact that those already accepting it would have done so only
        on account of weighty reasons. Others were now constrained to accept
        what everybody else accepted, lest they might pass for restless souls
        who were setting themselves up against generally received opinions, and
        for malapert hinds, who would be wiser than the rest of the world.
        Assent now becomes a duty.<br>
        Now the few who are capable of judging must be silent&nbsp;; and those
        who are permitted to speak are those who, perfectly incapable of forming
        their own opinion or judgment, are the mere echo of the opinions of
        others&nbsp;; nevertheless, they are all the more zealous and intolerant
        advocates there of. For they hate in those thinking otherwise, not so
        much the diverse opinion they hold, as the arrogance of daring to judge
        for themselves&nbsp;; something, by the way, which they never venture
        themselves, of which they are at least conscious.<br>
        In short, very few can think, but all claim the right of having
        opinions&nbsp;; what else then remains for these latter, since they
        cannot make opinions for themselves, but to adopt the ready-made opinion
        of others&nbsp;? As this is the case of what avail now are the voices of
        a hundred million of men&nbsp;? "Dico ego, tu dicis, sed denique
        dixit et ille&nbsp;; dicta que post toties nil nisi dicta
        vides&nbsp;!" - <i><font color="#0000ff">Text-book of Homœopathy,
        by D. V. Grauvogl</font></i>, Part II., p. 390, <i><font color="#0000ff">et
        seq</font></i>.<br>
        Auscultatory symptoms of provers are, of course, welcome, like all the
        other objective symptoms&nbsp;; but it is a horrible mistake to suppose
        that there is so much depending on them. There is no necessity, no gain
        of certainty, in obtaining any auscultatory symptoms from any
        drug&nbsp;! In thousands of cases the remedy has been found, without
        having any such extreme or material symptom. We have to decide by the
        individualities of the given case, and we'll heal the sick by drugs that
        never produced such symptoms, and very likely never will. <i><font color="#0000ff">Vice
        versa</font></i>, if a drug has really produced valvular alterations,
        hypertrophy or dilatation, tubercles in the lungs, or exudations on the
        pleura, or anything else. And a drug never will cure the same unless the
        <i><font color="#0000ff">characteristics of the case correspond with it</font></i>,
        and if these correspond it will cure it, and the organic lesion will, if
        it is a possibility, be removed. No matter if the drug never <i><font color="#0000ff">has</font></i>
        nor <i><font color="#0000ff">will</font></i> produce it. Guiseppo Mauro
        cured a case of hypertrophy with the sound of the purring of a cat
        (Arch. X., 1, 150) according to the symptoms of Hahnemann's provers,
        without any auscultatory symptoms&nbsp;; and Bethman (A. H. Z., 3, 109)
        a case of dilatation, where the stethoscope manifested the undulatory
        motion of systole and diastole, without any such symptom having been
        observed by any of the provers of <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>.
        A. Haynel, P. P. Wells, and others have treated the worst cases of
        valvular diseases with the greatest success, and given <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>
        without having a single auscultatory symptom of the same.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> has been proved by nearly
        fifty provers&nbsp;; not one of them had exudation of the pleura. We
        know it has cured innumerable cases.<br>
        It is a great mistake to say that if a drug produces a disease,
        particularly an organic lesion, it will cure such disease. It may, but
        only if it corresponds with the case, and it will then, if it never
        produced any such organic symptom.<br>
        This is a long quotation from the above referred to article, but is well
        worth the space. If the writings of the masters who followed Hahnemann
        when the sure foundation of the homœopathic healing art was laid were
        referred to and studied and applied, there would be less mongrelism and
        less bungling.</p>
