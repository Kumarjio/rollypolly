        <p align="JUSTIFY">1876, May 1st. A young lady, daughter of a deceased
        homœopathic physician, discovered <i><font color="#0000ff">pediculi
        capitis</font></i> three weeks ago, with itching of the head, which
        became sore, probably from scratching. Now there are scabs on lower
        occiput, gradually extending up the head&nbsp;; they discharge a <i><font color="#0000ff">yellow
        glutinous, very offensive fluid, causing hairs to adhere</font></i>.
        Cervical glands swollen and tender to touch, on and off, for three
        weeks. Pale and weak. Has taken Sulph. 6 and Acon. 6, which only
        improved for a time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">DIAGNOSIS OF THE REMEDY. -<br>
        Scabs on head moist <i><font color="#0000ff">Anath., Graph., (Lyc.),
        (Psor.), Rhus., Ruta (Sars.), Staph. (Sul.)</font></i>.<br>
        Scabs on head fetid. <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph. (Lyc.), (Merc.),
        Nat. mur. Rhus. (Silic.), (Sulph.)</font></i>.<br>

        Glutinous fluid forming scabs, <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>.
        Thus <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>. proved to be the <i><font color="#0000ff">Similimum</font></i>,
        and a dose of 14m (Fincke) was given three times a day.<br>
        May 6th. Scabs increased, and have reached the vertex, but feels much
        stronger. Glands not now tender. Boil on nates discharges much. Continue
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>.<br>
        May 10th. Much better since 7th&nbsp;; no discharge for two days, no
        offensive smell, and hair does not adhere. Continue <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>.
        twice a day.<br>
        May 19th. Scabs dry. Hairs adhere very little. Itching in head. Pediculi
        have continued all along. Boils much better. Continue <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>.<br>
        May 23rd. Felt better generally for three days. Less itching. No
        discharge except from scratching. Only one pediculi found today. Only
        one large boil on thigh. Continue <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>.<br>
        July 8th. Continued medicine until about three weeks ago, and has been
        steadily improving. Only <i><font color="#0000ff">occasionally</font></i>
        a pediculi discovered. No scales for three weeks&nbsp;; only a <i><font color="#0000ff">little</font></i>
        scurfy. Hair does not fall off, and has not had to have it cut off. <i><font color="#0000ff">Feels
        better than she did before the eruption</font></i>. No more medicine.<br>
        Aug. 28th. Reports <i><font color="#0000ff">perfectly well</font></i>.<br>
        Nov. 18th. Remained well till about six weeks ago, when she had a slight
        return, for which she took a trituration of <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>.
        on her own account, with success.<br>
        1879, Feb. No return of symptoms. She considers that her general health
        has been better than before the eruption.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">COMMENTS. -<br>
        (1) This case bears upon the repetition of the dose. The patient was
        suffering from depressing external conditions&nbsp;; these often thwart
        the curative action of the remedy, which then requires to be continued a
        longer time.<br>
        (2) After the eruption was healed the patient felt better than before.
        The psoric miasm is often <i><font color="#0000ff">focussed</font></i>,
        as it were into an acute attack, and if this is treated by the
        appropriate antipsoric the health is <i><font color="#0000ff">permanently</font></i>
        improved.<br>
        (3) After the <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>. was commenced,
        the patient <i><font color="#0000ff">felt much stronger</font></i>,
        though the scabs were increasing. This was a sign of true improvement
        (see <i><font color="#0000ff">Organon</font></i>, section 253)&nbsp;;
        the increase of the eruption resulting from the endeavor of the <i><font color="#0000ff">vis
        medicatrix naturæ</font></i>, aided by the remedy, to drive the miasm
        to the surface.<br>
        (4) As far as I am aware, the development of pediculi capitis has not
        been recorded under <i><font color="#0000ff">Graph</font></i>. I am now
        successfully treating by correspondence, with a still higher potency of
        Graph., an <i><font color="#0000ff">awful</font></i> case of the same
        disease, the characteristic indications being, as in the above case, <i><font color="#0000ff">scabs
        moist&nbsp;; discharging offensive fluid, causing hairs to adhere, with
        pediculi</font></i>. (Berridge.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">SUPPRESSED ECZEMA</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 25</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A child three years of age had eczema capitis. Under
        allopathic local treatment the eczema disappeared&nbsp;; but soon
        enterocolitis of a very obstinate character set in. Then the regulars
        could not "do" that as they had the eczema, and after they had
        given up the case, pronouncing it consumption of the bowels, the homœopath
        (myself) was called in on the ground that he could do no harm, if he
        could do no good. Child greatly emaciated, little or no appetite, very
        restless, and "<i><font color="#0000ff">stools brown fluid mixed
        with undigested substances and of an intolerable fetid odor</font></i>."
        Taking into the account the history of the suppressed eczema, I
        prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i> 6 m (Jenichen)
        and in a short time a perfect cure was the result. (Nash.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- <i><font color="#0000ff">Psorinum</font></i>
        has a similar stool as was present in this case, but the eruptions of
        the two remedies are different, and this one corresponded to <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>.<br>
        If this case of so long standing had not had the eruption I might have
        thought of <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i> on account of the
        extreme weakness from long continued drain or loss of fluid, for <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
        is another remedy that has <i><font color="#0000ff">brown fetid loose
        stools</font></i>. So one must take in <i><font color="#0000ff">the
        whole case</font></i> psora and all. (N.)<br>
        See my "Leaders in Homœopathic Therapeutics" for another case
        of eczema of the legs cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph</font></i>.
        followed by <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>. (N.). It will
        be remembered that with <i><font color="#0000ff">sulphur</font></i> all
        the orifices are red. With <i><font color="#0000ff">Graphites</font></i>
        they are&nbsp;:<br>
        1. Eczematous, eruptive or fissured.<br>
        2. The eruptions are moist, with thick glutinous discharge.<br>
        3. Obesic persons are its true subjects. These three characteristics
        present, it will cure many different affections.</p>
