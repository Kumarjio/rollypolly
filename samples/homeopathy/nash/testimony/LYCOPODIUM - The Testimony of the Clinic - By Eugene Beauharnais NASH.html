        <p align="JUSTIFY">F. Luce, aged ten years, light complexion, hair and
        blue eyes. Taken first with a chill followed by high fever. There was
        severe headache and pains in back and limbs. Pulse 140. Throat hurts
        when he swallows. Examination of throat reveals <i><font color="#0000ff">right
        tonsil</font></i> much swollen and covered with thick yellowish
        membrane. The left tonsil just beginning to enlarge&nbsp;; very
        offensive breath. <i><font color="#0000ff">Nose so stuffed</font></i> up
        that he cannot breathe with mouth closed. Disease seemed to <i><font color="#0000ff">commence
        in the nose</font></i> and go down. Very restless, having only short
        naps at a time, when patient awakes, <i><font color="#0000ff">kicking
        and crying and very cross</font></i>. With these symptoms there could be
        only one appropriate remedy R. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
        c. c. in solution, a spoonful once in two hours until the child rested
        better, then at longer intervals.<br>
        Next day the fever was less, patient slept better and longer at a time,
        and the formation of membrane seemed checked. For two days following the
        case seemed to progress favorably, when the child was carried into an
        adjoining room (the kitchen) where the doors were often open. This was
        on the morning of the fourth day. In the afternoon a hoarse, croupy
        cough appeared, and continued to grow rapidly worse until 9 P. M., when
        I was sent for. Found the child sitting upright in the father's arms,
        bent forward, the only position in which it could breathe with any
        degree of comfort. Breathing extremely difficult and wheezing. Frequent
        croupy cough and paroxysms of suffocation. There was now, also, a
        profuse, watery or rather stringy mucous discharge from the nose with
        very watery eyes. No extension of membrane in sight, but the formation
        is evidently gone down into the larynx.<br>
        R. <i><font color="#0000ff">Kali bich</font></i>. 30 in solution, once
        an hour, until amelioration, then at lengthened intervals.<br>
        Improvement was manifest before midnight, and the case went on to
        recovery with no change of medicine except a few doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Causticum</font></i>
        200 to recover an inability to speak loud. Lycop. would have cured this
        case "but for the exposure."<br>
        My own little girl, æt. five years, was taken with about the same
        symptoms, except that the nasal symptoms in the beginning were more
        intense. A large piece of membrane forming high up in the posterior
        nares and hanging down and inch in sight. The right tonsil was greatly
        swollen and covered with membrane. She was cured by <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
        6m (Jenichen), no other remedy being needed. The large piece of membrane
        (postnasal) came off entire on the third day during her sleep, so
        choking her that her mother snatched her from the cradle to prevent her
        choking to death. She turned the child immediately upon her face, but
        the membrane was swallowed. There were no laryngeal symptoms in this
        case. (Nash.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- I have cured several similar cases besides,
        some of them even more severe than these, but will not take the space to
        report them here, but will corroborate them with cures by others. (N.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Cough from bronchial irritation. K., aged fourteen,
        remarkably feeble and lean and of weak muscular development, but of
        sensitive mind and excellent intellect, whose mother died of
        consumption, has coughed for more than a week, dry and hoarse, day and
        night, coughs also in his sleep&nbsp;; then violent dry cough in the
        mornings&nbsp;; great emaciation&nbsp;; auscultation and percussion
        elicit no signs of serious lesion of the lungs&nbsp;; respiration and
        action of heart abnormally rapid from nervous excitement. <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopod</font></i>.
        200, two doses produced immediate improvement, and subsequent rapid
        recovery. The same symptoms were corroborated soon after by another case
        (dry cough day and night in feeble, emaciated boy).<br>

        <p align="CENTER">DYSPEPSIA</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 13</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A mason, temperament nervobilious&nbsp;; for the last
        year has had <i><font color="#0000ff">dyspepsia</font></i>. For two
        hours after eating spits up his food, but it is not acid. A few
        mouthfuls of food seems to <i><font color="#0000ff">fill</font></i> him
        to the throat. Stomach bloats a great deal with flatus, which gives him
        much distress. Bowels constipated. Has much dull frontal headache. Has
        taken much cathartic medicine, which does no good. In this case every
        symptom except the last one is a most prominent characteristic of <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>
        in its whole pathogenesis. One prescription of the 30th made a perfect
        cure. (Burt.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- Many more cases might be given of this
        wonderful remedy of which the old school of medicine knows almost
        nothing, but this is not our object in this work. We only give a few
        under each remedy. In my lectures on materia medica in New York, after
        going over the remedy in detail, I give at the end a sort of resume of
        seven most prominent symptoms around which the whole drug revolved. This
        was the one for <i><font color="#0000ff">Lycopodium</font></i>&nbsp;:<br>
        1. Spare, thin faced, furrowed of wrinkled, dark, sallow persons.<br>
        2. Much flatulence, most in lower abdomen, with much rumbling of wind,
        mostly pressing downward.<br>
        3. Uric acid diathesis, red sand in clear urine.<br>
        4. Right-sided complaints, which often go over to the left.<br>
        5. Satiety or hunger, but fills up quickly and bloats after eating.<br>
        6. Worse from 4 to 8 P. M. (the grand characteristic).<br>
        7. Mind irritable, angry or depressed, weeping or stupid&nbsp;;
        impending paresis. I might add here if I had not confined myself to
        seven&nbsp;:<br>
        1. Uncovering &gt;, (<i><font color="#0000ff">Silic</font></i>.
        reverse).<br>
        2. &gt; by warm drinks.<br>
        3. Suddenness (flashes, pains, satiety).<br>
        4. Hand clutching entrails (sensation).<br>
        5. Restlessness &gt; by motion (<i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>.)<br>
        6. Right foot hot, left cold.<br>
        7. Burning pains &gt; by heat (scapular, breasts).<br>
        8. Dryness of parts (mucous membranes, vagina, skin, especially palms.)</p>
