        <p align="JUSTIFY">Miss Anna Tanner, age 20, got creeping chilliness or
        shivering in the evening, rapid swelling of tonsils with pains shooting
        up into parotid and ears&nbsp;; great redness of the parts (tonsils and
        uvula)&nbsp;; difficult swallowing&nbsp;; drinks escape by the
        nose&nbsp;; horribly offensive odor of the breath&nbsp;; flabby tongue,
        showing imprint of the teeth&nbsp;; high fever and thirst&nbsp;;
        perspiration profuse but affords no relief. Seems as though the tonsils
        must suppurate. Here is a typical case of tonsillitis. <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius
        vivus</font></i> (Fincke) c. m. in solution was followed with rapid and
        complete subsidence of all these symptoms and rapid recovery without
        suppuration. I have cured many such cases with the same potency of this
        remedy. (So have others.) (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sore throat commencing a few days after entering a
        cotton mill. Utterances very thick, speaking seemed painful&nbsp;; in
        course of ten minutes expectorated six or eight times a mouthful of
        glairy mucus&nbsp;; intense dull, heavy aching in both tonsils, and a
        similar pain in small of back&nbsp;; hawks continually&nbsp;; little
        sleep for three nights, and feels unable to work longer&nbsp;; ulcerated
        swollen tonsils, about a quarter of an inch in depth and width&nbsp;;
        tonsils purple and hard&nbsp;; whole buccal cavity purple&nbsp;; uvula
        purple and enlarged, and appears as if twisted on itself, turned much to
        the left side&nbsp;; tongue twice normal thickness, purple on sides an
        beneath, and <i><font color="#0000ff">dorsum covered with a thick yellow
        coat to within</font></i> one-half an inch of tip, which is dry and
        swollen&nbsp;; breath extremely fetid. Pseudo-homœopathy had failed.
        Ordered <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. iod. flav</font></i>. c. m. every
        hour. About fifteen minutes after first dose entire relief to back and
        throat, and went to sleep&nbsp;; was wakened by his mother to give
        second dose (never wake patient on whom the homœopathic remedy has
        induced sleep, nor repeat the dose so long as such a marked improvement
        continues). Soon after taking it pain returned with greater severity
        than ever, lasting till morning, and so bad that he walked the floor
        groaning from pain the whole night&nbsp;; the pains lessened about 9 A.
        M.&nbsp;; the hawking and spitting ceased about noon, and now
        (twenty-four hours after first dose) patient feels quite well and
        tonsils, etc., look much better&nbsp;; in forty-eight hours cured.<br>
        Dr. I. himself had angina with such intense suffering, especially
        continuous aching, dragging pain in tonsils and small of back, that
        there had been no sleep for ninety-six hours&nbsp;; eating was
        impossible, and speech was so indistinct and so painful that he used
        gestures, prostration from the pain and loss of sleep&nbsp;; <i><font color="#0000ff">tongue
        coated yellow. Merc. iod. flav.</font></i> 30 and other drugs had done
        no good. Took <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. iod. flavus</font></i> c.
        m, in twenty minutes slept, and woke free from pains, and in forty-eight
        hours was well. (M. Preston.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">A young girl aged about 14 came to me with a pustular
        eruption in the left leg extending from the ankle to the hip&nbsp;; the
        pustules were filled with yellow matter, and were in size from a millet
        seed to a pea. When the larger ones had broken and discharged they ran
        together and left a red, raw, sore surface. Various domestic lotions and
        ointments had been applied with no good effect. The leg was drawn up so
        that the girl walked on the toes on that side. The symptom that led to
        the prescription was that the pain, itching and burning were all greatly
        aggravated in the <i><font color="#0000ff">warmth of the bed and at
        night. Mercurius solubilis</font></i> 2 m, Jenichen, promptly relieved
        the suffering, and in a few days the patient was cured. (Nash.)<br>

        and limbs. Skin covered with crusts and papulæ. Eruption first appeared
        over two years ago as very small elevated spots on back of wrists,
        gradually extending to the other parts of the body. Itching so
        intolerable it almost sets him crazy if he gets a little warmer than
        usual while at work. When he first gets into bed the cool sheets feel so
        nice he goes right to sleep, but after sleeping about half an hour he is
        awakened by this awful itching and has to get out of bed and walk the
        floor until the sheets get cool again. <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc.

        X., seen June 9, 1903. Chancre on chin&nbsp;; accidental inoculation
        from husband, who had the same on his chin, but was not diagnosed, and
        was followed by the usual secondary symptoms. Chancre of Mrs. X. was of

        fifty cent piece, surrounded by a red inflammatory area. Submaxillary
        glands swollen. Throat sore. General aggravation at night. Had received <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius

        with very slight relief. Throat now aggravated&nbsp;; burns like a hot

        Pain extending to ear and down neck to clavicle. Submaxillary gland
        still swollen. Secondary roseola on skin of trunk and limbs. Pain &lt;
        right side. Chancre discharges a yellowish pus from centre&nbsp;; is a

        September 15. Two small ulcers on inside cheek. Placebo.<br>
        September 29. These ulcers refuse to heal, but are not very sore. <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc.
        iod. flav</font></i>. 45 m (Fincke), one dose.<br>
        October 15. Ulcers healed. No symptoms. Placebo.<br>
        May 14, 1907. There have been no syphilitic symptoms since, and no
        discoloration or scar visible at site of chancre. No hair was lost. Time
        of cure, four months. (R. F. Rabe.)<br>
        Dr. J. B. Garrison remarks that, "If we can learn to believe that
        homœopathy presents a better and quicker manner of curing syphilis than
        any other, we will not resort to the methods that have been tried and
        retried for centuries with disappointment. We must not think that we
        have prescribed homœopathically merely because we have given a remedy
        that is said by the text books to be valuable in such cases, but must
        work out the case carefully, using our repertories and trying to be sure
        that we have arrived at the similimum. Let me also say that if we may
        have a feeling that we are not able to select the remedy to our
        satisfaction, do not hesitate to call to our aid a specialist in
        homœopathic therapeutics, just as we expect to be called in to aid the
        general practitioner when our specialities are involved. It will redound
        to our credit and to the school we represent." These are true words
        and sound advice. The surgeon and the specialist can do better surgical
        and special work in conjunction with skillful homœopathic prescribing
        than any other way. Without such medication he can do no better work
        than his allopathic neighbor, and need not claim to. (N.)<br>
        Here are seven cases given under <i><font color="#0000ff">Mercurius</font></i>.
        They might be multiplied by seven, as might every one of our polychrest
        remedies. But we must not linger too long on one, and will subjoin our
        resume&nbsp;:<br>
        1. Swollen, flabby tongue, taking imprint of teeth&nbsp;; gums also
        swollen, spongy or bleeding&nbsp;; breath very offensive.<br>
        2. Sweats day and night without relief.<br>
        3. Creeping chilliness in the beginning of a cold or threatened
        suppuration.<br>
        4. Sliminess of mucous membranes.<br>
        5. Moist tongue with intense thirst.<br>
        6. Glandular swelling, cold, inclined to suppurate. Ulcers with
        lardaceous base.<br>
        7. <i><font color="#0000ff">Modalities</font></i>, &lt; at night&nbsp;;
        in warmth of the bed while sweating, lying on right side.<br>
        This set is common to almost all the combinations of the Mercuries, but
        the very <i><font color="#0000ff">yellow coated tongue</font></i> is
        found under the <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. iod. flavus</font></i>.
        The bladder and urinary symptoms stand out most prominently under the <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc.
        corr</font></i>. So far as the <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. viv</font></i>.
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. sol</font></i>. are concerned they
        are so nearly similar that equally good prescribers use one or the other
        indiscriminately. Dr. Adolph Lippe preferred the <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc.
        vivus</font></i>, H. C. Allen the <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc.
        solubilis</font></i>. I use the <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. vivus</font></i>
        oftenest, though for skin affections and the second stage of catarrhal
        affections I prefer the <i><font color="#0000ff">Merc. solubilis</font></i>.
        No drug has been more abused by the old school, both in the past and the
        present. It was Hahnemann's great antisyphilitic, but under the bungling
        of the allopaths is responsible for sufferings worse than the disease.
        So taking together their indiscriminate use and overuse of it in
        so-called torpid liver and syphilis, they make a great mess of it both
        for those they treat and us who have so much to do in fixing up their
        drug-diseased, dilapidated patients.</p>
