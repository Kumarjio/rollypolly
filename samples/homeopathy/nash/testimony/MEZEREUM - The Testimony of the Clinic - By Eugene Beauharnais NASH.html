        <img src="./MEZEREUM - The Testimony of the Clinic - By Eugene Beauharnais NASH_files/farringtonh01.jpg" border="0" alt="Dr Harvey FARRINGTON (1872-1957)" align="right" hspace="5" width="202" height="270">Mr.
        F. M. B., age 50, has had tic douloureux for nearly thirty years. His
        mother and a brother also suffered from the same affection. The pain
        starts near the root of the canine tooth, upper left side, extending to
        the root of the nose upwards into left eye, and at times to the vertex.
        It comes like a flash, lasts a varying period of time and goes as
        quickly as it came. It is worse from the slightest motion of the
        adjacent parts, talking, eating, light touch - even touching the
        mustache. It is worse in the wind, whether cold or warm, probably
        because it causes the mustache to vibrate. Sometimes it comes on the
        first moving in the morning. It seldom occurs at night while lying down.
        It is relieved very slightly from hard pressure, and occasionally,
        though not often, by heat. During the pain tears roll down the cheeks
        from the eye of the affected side, and after the paroxysm the eyeball
        itches. From January 24, 1906, to June of the same year he received <i><font color="#0000ff">Magnesia
        Phos., Sepia, Magnesia carb</font></i>. and <i><font color="#0000ff">Spigelia</font></i>
        with very slight, if any, benefit, and finally becoming discouraged he
        returned to his old school physician.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Indirectly I heard that he still had spells of
        excruciating pain, ant that his nervous system was gradually giving way
        under the strain.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">However, early last June I received word that Mr. B.
        wanted to see me at his residence in Evanston. On arriving there I found
        the poor man in the midst of a severe spell of his old neuralgia,
        thoroughly disheartened and almost on the verge of nervous prostration.
        Through the persuasion of some of his friends he had determined to try
        homœopathy once more, as he had obtained no relief from any other form
        of treatment.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The symptoms were practically the same as those given
        above, excepting that there was no relief from heat or pressure. The
        effect of slight motion of lip or tongue was increased so that sucking
        or even swallowing almost invariably renewed the attack.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">But two new symptoms were added, itching of the
        affected parts before the pain and tingling and itching afterwards. He
        always knew when the pain was about to start, because the side of the
        face or the upper lip began to itch. This placed the case in a new
        light. A brief review of the repertory showed <i><font color="#0000ff">Mezereum</font></i>
        to be the only remedy which covered the symptoms group&nbsp;; then he
        was given the 30th potency, to be taken every three hours until the pain
        was relieved, then at longer intervals. The effect was almost immediate,
        and he continued to improve until he was able to start for Santa
        Catalina, off the coast of California, for a month's needed rest. (H.
        Farrington).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This furnishes our one hundred cases, of which we
        will speak more in our preface.</p>
