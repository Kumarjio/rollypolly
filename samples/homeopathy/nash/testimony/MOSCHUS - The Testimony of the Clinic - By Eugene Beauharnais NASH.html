        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 79</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">An old lady, Mrs. c., aged about 72, consulted me in
        September, 1877, for a sensation of trembling around the heart, with
        constriction in the whole chest, almost suffocation. In fact, the
        symptoms much resembled angina pectoris, and to confirm that diagnosis
        an arcus senilis existed, though not marked. Her pulse was 88, and the
        respiration oppressed. <i><font color="#0000ff">She felt continually
        obliged to take a deep breath</font></i>. My partner, Dr. T. R. Jones,
        now of Birkenhead, happened to come in, and agreed with me that Moschus
        was indicated. I had by me a new case of thirties, chiefly American
        triturations. I at once gave one grain of <i><font color="#0000ff">Moschus</font></i>
        30 trit., dry, on the tongue, and dissolved three grains in eight ounces
        of water, directing a dessertspoonful to be taken every two or three
        hours. After the first (dry) dose Mrs. C. felt much relieved, and after
        three more doses was quite well.<br>
        Three months afterwards a similar attack, not so violent, was cured just
        as quickly by <i><font color="#0000ff">Moschus</font></i> 30. (J. M.
        Moore, M. D.)<br>
        "The keynote in this unique case of Dr. Moore is evidently
        'Tightness of the chest so that one is obliged to take a deeper breath
        than usual'." (Allen's Encyclopædia, Vol. VI., p. 407.)<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Moschus</font></i> is apt to make no figure in
        the minds of physicians, because it is used as a perfumery with no
        apparent harm in many cases. But this is not a goof or sufficient reason
        for underestimating it as a remedy. Kent and Cowperthwaite do not notice
        it in their Materia Medicas. Lippe (Text Book) does, and I have verified
        the symptom, "Suffocative spasmodic constrictions of the chest,
        especially as soon as he becomes cold", as recorded there.<br>
        Its beneficial action is not confined to hysterical cases, although it
        is pre-eminently useful there.</p>
