        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 44</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the year 18-- I was called on to visit a Mrs. D.,
        aged 40, who had come some forty miles to place herself under my care
        for the treatment of an obstinate and grave inflammation to both eyes,
        supposed to have arisen from cold, and which had hitherto resisted all
        attempts at cure. The inflammation was severe, and the eyes so extremely
        sensitive that any examination beyond a mere glance was out of the
        question, and I hesitated somewhat to assume the responsibility of the
        case. Without delay she was placed under the use of such remedies as
        seemed indicated by the ascertained totality of symptoms, the names of
        which, writing from memory, cannot now be recalled.<br>
        This treatment continued about three weeks, the only beneficial result
        obtained being a slight mitigation of the symptoms. Not satisfied with
        so poor a return, and diligently searching for some cause for this
        partial success, I conceived that the history of the case might not have
        fully reached me. So I sat down for a patient inquiry, from which was
        gathered that Mrs. D., with her husband, emigrated from the city of
        London some years before this and had purchased a piece of land on our
        Northern Railroad contiguous to a marsh, the proximity of which induced
        recurring attacks of intermittent fever, for which <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>
        had been freely and often taken, with the usual effect of at length
        "breaking the chills," as it is termed, and, as our patient
        supposed, of curing the disease. Unfortunately, when the ague ceased its
        chill, etc., the eyes, which had hitherto been sound, became greatly
        inflamed, and so persistent and severe that at times total loss of
        vision seemed imminent.<br>
        My inference from this statement was that the intermittent fever had not
        been cured by the <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>, but
        suppressed, and so thrown back into the system to concentrate its
        baneful effects in another form, which I conceived to be this affection
        of the eyes. Should these deductions be correct, it was further premised
        that no improvement in the eyes was possible unless the restraining and
        suppressive action of the <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i> on
        the primary disease could be antidoted&nbsp;; and if this were
        predicable, the intermittent might return. Actuated by these thoughts,
        and the presence of <i><font color="#0000ff">nausea</font></i> as a
        prominent but hitherto unrecognized symptom, I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac</font></i>
        30, four times daily, during several days, when, to my surprise and
        delight, one morning about 9 o'clock a very decided chill set in more
        severe than any which the patient had yet experienced, followed by
        intense fever and subsequent perspiration.<br>
        The next day was an intermission, succeeded on the third day by a
        renewal of all the symptoms, time etc., of the first I had then a clear
        tertian, beginning at 9 A. M., from which, and other symptoms now
        forgotten, there remained no reasonable ground for rejecting <i><font color="#0000ff">Nat.
        mur</font></i>. as <i><font color="#0000ff">the</font></i> remedy. It
        was accordingly administered in the 30th potency four times daily for a
        while, an after three paroxysms, occupying nine days, the disease ceased
        to return, being, as the sequel showed, completely cured&nbsp;; and, to
        my great delight, the <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum</font></i> had
        acted so beneficially that nothing else was required, and I shortly had
        the pleasure of sending my patient home, cured of both the malarial
        fever and the terrible effect on the eyes of its having been suppressed.
        (John Hall). This case shows, first, the danger of the favorable
        treatment of malarial fever with the inevitable <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>
        of the old school&nbsp;; second, that the history of the case is very
        important&nbsp;; third, that the indicated remedy may restore the
        disease suppressed and so pave the way for the administration of the <i><font color="#0000ff">curative</font></i>
        remedy, which, if it had been administered at the beginning, would have
        easily <i><font color="#0000ff">cured</font></i> the case at once.<br>
        Carroll Dunham once cured a very obstinate case of chronic disease by
        restoring an eczema of the scalp, which had been suppressed by an
        ointment years before with <i><font color="#0000ff">Mezereum</font></i>
        200, the history of the original disease corresponding with that remedy.<br>
        I have myself often done similar work, and we all know of the necessity
        of keeping in mind the anti-psoric, sycotic and syphilitic complications
        which call for their appropriate remedies. (N.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 45</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I was called to Mrs. Shultz, a young married woman,
        who had a short time before (three months, I think) had a miscarriage.
        She had, under the care of an old school physician, who stood high in
        the profession, not recovered her health, but had grown anæmic, weak
        and emaciated, and a bad cough, with considerable expectoration, had set
        in. Now the doctor gave it as his opinion that she had consumption and
        an unfavourable prognosis.<br>
        This of course was discouraging, and as he had treated her so long with
        this result they concluded to change doctors.<br>
        I took charge of the case with some misgivings, as the former physician
        was a man of acknowledged ability, but, as I watched the case, after a
        few days I observed that what the doctor had called hectic fever every
        afternoon was preceded by a distinct chill every day at 10 A. M. with
        clock-like regularity. I also noticed that the high fever was
        accompanied with very red face and <i><font color="#0000ff">throbbing
        headache</font></i>, and was followed by sweat, which relieved all the
        suffering, and the rapid pulse became nearly normal in the morning. I
        also observed that the patient lived right on the banks of a swampy
        marsh. So I concluded to ignore the name the doctor had given the
        disease and give the remedy covering the symptoms. I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
        mur</font></i>., although it had never cured a case of consumption, and <i><font color="#0000ff">cured
        the patient</font></i>, completely and rapidly. (Nash.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Some would say that if the sputum, of which there was
        an abundance, had been subjected to microscopic investigation and had
        shown bacilli the splendid cure would not have been accomplished.
        Perhaps so&nbsp;; but I have made a cure of a case which was discharged
        from Saranac (the great resort for consumptives) as incurable and did
        show bacilli in abundance. She was told that she would live only a few
        months at the longest. If the case is not too far along the
        "bugs" will leave under the homœopathic remedy. (N.)</p>

        aged 53. She complains of a dull heavy feeling all over her&nbsp;;
        almost continual headache, which is worse in cloudy and damp
        weather&nbsp;; extremely sensitive to cold air, especially the head and
        feet&nbsp;; sleeps well, but dreams bad dreams. There are also
        unmistakable evidences of liver trouble, which she says have existed for
        twenty-five years. The period of aggravation of all her symptoms,
        especially headache, is between<br>
        10 A. M. and 12 noon&nbsp;; the appetite is generally fair&nbsp;; has a
        craving for salt. The history of this case shows that when she was a
        girl she had frequent and protracted attacks of fever and ague, during
        which she took large quantities of <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>
        in some form or other. She says she has never been well since
        then&nbsp;; she continually experiences a dull and heavy feeling
        throughout her whole body.<br>
        Her only recollection of these attacks, of the fever and ague, is that
        she was at that time fond of salt&nbsp;; craved salt. It is very evident
        that this patient, when she had the fever and ague, was a subject for <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
        mur</font></i>., and the probability is that had she had the remedy
        administered at that time her life would not have been so miserable an
        existence during the interim. The remedy is clearly indicated at the
        present time, especially by the craving for salt, and the persistent
        headache agg. between 10 A. M. and 12 noon and the bad reams. Jan. 29th

        Feb. 12th. Same report&nbsp;; still improving.<br>
        Feb. 19th. Continual improvement.<br>
        March 4th. The patient seemed almost well and said she had improved more
        during the past week than in any previous week since taking the

        prescribed at her first visit. (C. M. Boger.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">R., boy aged four years, had for fourteen months
        continued attacks of tertian intermittent. Quinine had been given until
        the little fellow sensibly refused to take more.<br>
        In August, 1880, I learned that he had had a paroxysm every other day
        for seven months. The malarial and quinine cachexia was well marked, and
        with the chill, which began between 10 and 11 A. M., there was intense
        thirst for large draughts of water, and during the fever which followed
        he complained of his head "hurting and jumping." One dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Natrum
        mur</font></i>. (30) was given at the end of a paroxysm. He remained
        free from another attack until in the following October, when, the same
        symptoms presenting, another dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Nat. mur</font></i>.
        was given, and he has no chills since (May, 1881), and has continued to
        live in the same place, and his health is constantly improving. This
        case came under observation while I was visiting the section in which he
        resides with his parents, and on learning that many cases of a similar
        character were in the neighborhood I felt a vial of Nat. mur., with
        directions to give one dose to any case met with&nbsp;; and I learned a
        few months afterwards that several cases had been cured with that
        remedy. (Geo. H. Clarke.)</p>

        21, 1878, John H-----, æt 29, seaman, had fever and ague two or three
        times a day, with watery vomiting, in Calcutta, in September, 1877. Was
        in Calcutta Hospital three weeks for it and took emetics, quinine and
        tonics. Left at the end of the three weeks cured, but before he was out
        of port the ague returned, or he got another, and he had a five months'
        voyage home to the port of Liverpool. During the first three months of
        this homeward voyage he had 2, 3, 4, 5 attacks a week, and took a great
        deal of a powder from the captain, which, from his description, was
        probably Cinchona bark&nbsp;; then the fever left him and the following
        condition supervened, viz., "pain in right side, under the
        ribs&nbsp;; cannot lie on right side&nbsp;; both calves very painful to
        touch, they are hard and stiff&nbsp;; left leg semi-flexed, and he
        cannot stretch it." In this condition he was two months at sea, and
        two weeks ashore&nbsp;; and in this condition he comes to me, hobbling
        with the aid of a stick and in great pain from the moving.<br>
        Urine muddy and red&nbsp;; bowels regular&nbsp;; skin tawny&nbsp;;
        conjunctiva yellow. Drinks about three pints of beer daily. I recommend

        the water cleared at once&nbsp;; but the pain returned on the fourth day
        in the left calf only, which today is red, painful, swelled and pits. He
        walks without a stick. Continue medicine.<br>
        May 4th. Almost well, feels only a very little pain in left calf in

        Therapeutics," there is no remedy in the Materia Medica, I think,
        that so disgusts the advocates of the low potency, and low only, as this
        one. The unquestionable cures of the most obstinate cases of
        intermittent fever with the 200th potency demoralizes them. That people
        eating salt in appreciable quantities right along and can't live without
        it don't get well on it, and <i><font color="#0000ff">do</font></i> get
        well on the same thing potentized, does not hold to reason, the
        microscope, molecular theory, spectrum analysis or anything else
        scientific (so called), not being able to discover any material in the
        dose. But there stand the cures, like the blind man whom Jesus healed.
        It is a hard thing to be confronted by such facts against our
        prejudices."<br>
        Any school of medicine, or any physician in any school of medicine who
        refuses to accept such testimony of the power of this remedy, even in
        the potencies, to cure the sick (and there are many other remedies
        equally convincing) has no right to lay any claim to being scientific,
        or even reasonable.</p>
