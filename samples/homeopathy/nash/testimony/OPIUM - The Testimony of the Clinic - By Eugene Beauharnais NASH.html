        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Miss B., school teacher, brunette, age 26, had taught
        for several years, and was very nervous and worried much about her work.
        She asked me to give her something for insomnia. Had taken sulphonal,
        but feared she would get into the habit of it. She was sleepy more or
        less in the daytime, and in the evening before going to bed, but as soon
        as she was in bed the sleepiness vanished, and she would lie awake for
        hours. She was not restless, did not twitch or jerk&nbsp;; the only
        marked symptom that she had was that her hearing was very <i><font color="#0000ff">acute</font></i>&nbsp;;
        said she could hear every noise within a mile of her - dogs barking,
        roosters crowing, etc. I gave her three powders of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
        30, with instructions to take one when she went to bed at 10 P. M., and
        the others when she heard the clock strike. She only took me, as she was
        asleep in a short time after the first dose. She had one or two similar
        attacks of insomnia afterwards, but <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium </font></i>30th
        always relieved. (Ella M. Tuttle.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">TYPHOID</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 70</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">January, winter of 1904, I was called in consultation
        with Dr. D., of New York, to a case of typhoid fever. Found the patient
        who had been sick two or three weeks (I forget which) lying on his back
        with eyes half closed, in heavy sleep and heavy breathing, and very red
        face. It was very hard to get him to recognize any one, and then he
        relapsed immediately into the soporous state again. There had been
        intervals when he had roused into actual delirium, but the soporous
        condition had predominated. He was an operator in Wall Street, and his
        delirium was mostly along the line of his business. For this in the
        earlier stage he had received <i><font color="#0000ff">Bryonia</font></i>,
        but as the present state obtained, the doctor had given him <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>,
        which had been faithfully adhered to for several days. The doctor is a
        fine prescriber, but on looking the case over again carefully I said <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>.
        We gave it in the 30th, and the next day as we walked into the sick room
        the patient exclaimed, Hello&nbsp;! doctor, how are you&nbsp;? Every
        symptom had correspondingly improved. I saw him for six days afterward,
        and the improvement continued. The doctor said that he had to have a few
        doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. afterward, and
        made a good recovery. (Nash.)<br>
        It is sometimes difficult to choose between <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyoscyamus</font></i>, but I have found, as
        a rule, that with the former the sopor was the predominant condition,
        while with <i><font color="#0000ff">Hyos</font></i>. the high grade
        delirium was in the ascendency. But both remedies have these
        alternating. This dual action of drugs must never be lost sight of. Here
        are two cases which illustrate it, <i><font color="#0000ff">ab usu in
        morbus</font></i>&nbsp;; stertor or sleepiness, the primary of <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
        action, and the sleeplessness the secondary or reactionary effect.
        Again, I may be permitted to refer my reader to "Leaders in Homœopathic
        Therapeutics", page 298, 3d edition, for further explanations along
        this line.</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 71</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Child woke up apparently frightened crying and
        screaming to the full extent of its lungs, refusing to be consoled&nbsp;;
        finally spasms in the midst of extreme tossing and restlessness&nbsp;;
        it jerked from head to foot, and threw its head as far back as possible,
        with upturned eyes, open mouth and quivering chin&nbsp;; <i><font color="#0000ff">legs
        and arms spread</font></i>. The spasms ended in sleep, a heavy <i><font color="#0000ff">guttural
        breathing</font></i>, and an occasional deep, <i><font color="#0000ff">prolonged
        sigh</font></i>&nbsp;; tremulous limbs, hard abdomen and feeble, quick
        pulse were the most prominent features present. After half an hour of
        this tiresome sleep it roused, screaming, with tossing and trembling of
        head and limbs, and short jerks of the flexor muscles, and lapsed at
        once into a hard, irregularly developed spasm with all the
        characteristics of the first. <i><font color="#0000ff">Opium</font></i>
        30 cured. (Baer.)</p>
