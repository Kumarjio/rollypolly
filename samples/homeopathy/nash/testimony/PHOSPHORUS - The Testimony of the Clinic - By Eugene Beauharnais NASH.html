        was in 1851, on one of those unsurpassably hot mornings that prevail
        here in August, that I was summoned to see a case of cholera at a great
        distance. A Redemptorist Father had been with him during the night, and
        finding his apparently homœopathic treatment not as successful as he
        desired wished further advice. The patient was an emaciated, sharp-faced
        German, a tailor, about 50 years old. He had indulged on the previous
        day for his supper in blood pudding and cucumber salad. He was taken
        about 11 P. M. with Asiatic cholera&nbsp;; he still continued to vomit
        and to be purged, with violent cramp at short intervals. All of these
        cramps and rice-water discharges ceased during that day, the principal
        remedy had been Arsenicum&nbsp;; but from that evening till the next
        evening he continued to vomit, and apparently was sinking from
        exhaustion.<br>
        Thirst was very great&nbsp;; he had to drink large quantities of cold
        water, and felt better afterwards, <i><font color="#0000ff">till the
        water became warm in his stomach in from fifteen to twenty minutes, and
        then he had to vomit it up again, to be relieved of this exhausting
        painful vomiting and thirst by drinking another large quantity of water</font></i>.
        A number of remedies administered produced not the slightest relief.<br>
        The symptom found by the clinical experiment in this case - cold water
        drunk is vomited up as soon as it becomes warm in the stomach - was not
        to be found in our Materia Medica. But there was found, after a long
        search, under <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>, in the
        fifth volume of Hahnemann's Chronic Diseases, Symptom 745&nbsp;: "<i><font color="#0000ff">In
        the most terrible agonies he vainly tried to vomit&nbsp;; only the
        drinking of cold water relieved</font></i>." Nothing could be found
        in a search for a similar remedy but this symptom, and now we gave this
        suffering man one dose of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
        19m. about 9 P. M., with the order to repeat it every two hours until he
        was relieved. On the next morning we found that he had been given no
        more than this solitary dose, and that he was rapidly improving. He
        recovered without needing any more medicine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">COMMENTS. The case here briefly stated might be
        claimed to belong to the "<i><font color="#0000ff">Causes
        célèbres.</font></i>" Ever since this case was cured and
        published everybody has admitted into our Materia Medica this so
        frequently confirmed <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
        symptom - "vomiting of what has been drunk as soon as it becomes
        warm in the stomach." Everybody knows it, and the knowing ones have
        and will continue to cure this not infrequently recurring symptom with <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>.
        The case illustrates the manner in which our Materia Medica has been <i><font color="#0000ff">developed</font></i>&nbsp;;
        how symptoms observed by provers <i><font color="#0000ff">only similar</font></i>
        to the symptoms observed on the sick as the result of disease may be
        cured by a given drug, and that the confirmation of such cures entitle
        this symptoms - <i><font color="#0000ff">the result of the clinical
        experiment - to as much importance as if it had been observed on a dozen
        of provers</font></i>.<br>
        Upon <i><font color="#0000ff">reflection</font></i>, the men who
        persistently insist in the sifting of our Materia Medica may think the
        better of it. (Ad. Lippe.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">DYSENTERY</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 55</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Several years ago I treated a child suffering for two
        weeks from an obstinate attack of dysentery. Several remedies had failed
        utterly. Counsel was called, but our combined efforts were equally
        unsuccessful. At one of my visits the mother chanced to be changing the
        child's diaper. I noticed that the anus was wide open. I could have
        inserted my little finger to the depth of two inches without touching
        the bloody mucus-lined walls. (The tenesmus was almost continuous).
        Neither Jahr's <i><font color="#0000ff">Manual</font></i> (snelling),
        Bell on <i><font color="#0000ff">Diarrhœa</font></i>, nor Hering's <i><font color="#0000ff">Condensed</font></i>
        contain this important symptom. Finally I discovered this under <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
        in Lippe's <i><font color="#0000ff">Textbook</font></i>. Three days
        after the use of the remedy naught remained of the troublesome disease
        except the resulting weakness. (Nash.)<br>
        This case was published in the "Hahnemannian Monthly", May,
        1880. In the June number of the same journal Dr. F. B. McManus, of
        Baltimore, Md., wrote&nbsp;: "On reading Dr. Nash's cure my mind
        was vividly called to what I had learned forty years ago, in regard to
        that precise symptom and condition given in <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>,
        recorded in the <i><font color="#0000ff">first American</font></i>
        translation of the <i><font color="#0000ff">first German</font></i>
        edition of Jahr's <i><font color="#0000ff">Manual</font></i>, translated
        "by the North American Academy of the Healing Art, Allentown,
        1838." In the repertory of that volume, under the head of
        "Anus and Alvine Ejections", is found, "Openness constant
        of the anus." In the manual <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
        has, "Escape of slime and blood from the anus, which <i><font color="#0000ff">continually
        is open</font></i>." In Hempel's translation of Jahr, large
        edition, of 1848, ten years after the Allentown edition of Jahr, is
        found, as a symptom for <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>,
        "Mucous discharge from the anus, which is constantly open."<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vomica</font></i> has precisely the <i><font color="#0000ff">reversed</font></i>
        condition of <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>, the former
        having discharge of bloody mucus, with a sense of <i><font color="#0000ff">constriction,
        - Phosphorus</font></i> a similar discharge, with relaxation an
        openness. It will amply repay any physician to look into <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
        in all cases of intractable dysentery, particularly when the seat of the
        disease is <i><font color="#0000ff">confined to the rectum, and near to
        or involving the anus</font></i>.<br>
        In cases, too, of a <i><font color="#0000ff">reversed condition,
        inveterate constipation</font></i>, with disappointed calls, the trouble
        <i><font color="#0000ff">being seated in the rectum</font></i>, the
        attention of every astute physician would be called to <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>.<br>
        These two latter cases of Dr. Lippe's, and my own, are brought in here
        in order to show how valuable clinical symptoms came into our Materia
        Medica. As Dr. Hering used to say, "they are born by <i><font color="#0000ff">breach
        presentation</font></i>."<br>
        Nor does this, in my opinion, reflect in any degree upon the principe of
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Similia</font></i>, for if under the action of
        any remedy in potency a symptom or condition is removed it is fair to
        infer that the further or more exhaustive proving of the drug would
        produce the same symptom, etc.<br>
        To be sure symptoms disappear with which the remedy has nothing to do,
        but when it repeatedly or invariably does so, no other reasonable
        conclusion can be reached than that it was homœopathic to such a state.
        So such symptoms cannot be lightly rejected, but in all cases, when
        pathogenetic symptoms also correspond is the result doubly confirmed.</p>

        Note by the Editor (Dr. Geo G. Gale.)&nbsp;: "On receiving this

        <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i> will cure.<br>
        On the 17th of last September a washer-woman to the family was fairly
        "<i><font color="#0000ff">hors de combat</font></i>" with
        these symptoms and the following&nbsp;: Sinking at the
        epigastrium&nbsp;; nausea and loss of appetite&nbsp;; sleepless, and
        when she does sleep she wakes always with a congestive headache and
        giddiness. <i><font color="#0000ff">She is afraid to wash. Phosphorus</font></i>
        c. m. was given then and there, one powder dry on the tongue. We did not
        see her again till the 21st of Sept., when she informed us that
        "the last medicine had done her more good than all the rest put
        together." Thanks to Providence and his servant, Dr. Gale. We left
        her on the 21st of Oct., perfectly well and healthy, pursuing her
        vocation in comfort. (Skinner).<br>

        in "Allen's Encyclopædia", and reading from symptom 3860 to
        3880, we find plenty of reason for prescribing <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
        for the <i><font color="#0000ff">rush of blood</font></i> to the head
        and face, and symptom 3869 says&nbsp;: "Violent heat in the face

        <p align="JUSTIFY">C. H. Nearing, about 30 years of age, was attacked
        with pneumonia (double). The right side worst. There was great
        oppression of breathing, very high temperature and quick pulse,
        circumscribed redness of the cheeks, right most, not much pain, rather
        apathetic, the cough (without much expectoration at first), and
        oppression much worse when lying on the left side. What little pain was
        complained of was located in the lower right lobe, but the hepatization
        was general over that side and in evidence to quite a degree on the
        left. All this condition followed a chill at the beginning. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        did not do much good, though it had a fair chance. Then I gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Phosphorus</font></i>
        1 m in solution, to be repeated once in two hours.<br>
        In the night the wife came running to my office, saying she feared Mr.
        N. had gone into a stupor, and wished me to come immediately. I was at
        the bedside in a few moments, and instead of a stupor found my patient
        sleeping soundly enough, but quietly, and breathing quite a good deal
        more naturally, and bathed in a nice warm perspiration. I awoke him and
        he drew a long breath and said how much better I feel. Then he coughed
        and raised easily a mouthful of bloody sputum, with great relief, and
        made a rapid and complete recovery. (Nash).<br>

        of matches in 1869, and reported by "Knoevenagl, Berlin Klin.
        Woch." It has been verified so that it takes its place in
