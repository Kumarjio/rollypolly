        <p align="JUSTIFY">Intermittent fever. Miss B., when visited on the 28th
        of last June, had felt ill for several days, and complained then of
        wandering pains in the joints, worse from motion&nbsp;; the flesh sore
        to touch&nbsp;; pain in region of the spleen&nbsp;; eruption like
        nettlerash on the legs below the knees&nbsp;; she felt chilly this
        morning, and is now hot. She received <i><font color="#0000ff">China</font></i>
        900, one dose. When visited the next forenoon she said she had been
        attacked with perspiration at 1 A. M., which lasted until 7 A. M., when
        she had a decided chill followed with light heat, but with no sweat.
        This irregular and unusual order of symptoms did not suggest any remedy
        and it was concluded to give no medicine and await the progress of the
        case under the former and apparently well indicated remedy. In the
        afternoon I was called to see her again. At 11 A. M. she had a shaking
        chill with pains in the wrists, knees and ankles, followed with heat
        without pains, then sweat on the back, head, face and hollow of the
        elbows.<br>
        Here appeared to be a clear case, so far as known to the prescriber. The
        only remedy having all these concomitants of chill is <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>.
        She received at 5 P. M. one dose of the 1,000 potency. The next morning
        at 9 o'clock she had a chill, with thirst for hot drink, but without the
        pains of the previous day. She got no more medicine and had no more
        chill, except once slightly, three weeks later, just after sea bathing,
        and is in much improved health. I have several times prescribed Podoph.
        in intermittent fever, guided by these concomitants, sometimes
        strengthened by loquacity in the early stages, and sleepiness with the
        sweat, and it has not yet failed to cure. (Rushmore.)</p>

        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. Olmsted, aged 40, stout, rather bilious
        temperament, has been travelling in the west, much of the time in
        malarial districts. Came home and was attacked with intermittent fever.
        The chills occurred in the morning, were very severe, continuing until
        10 or 11 A. M., when he would go into the former stage, which was also
        very intense, and this would be followed with profuse sweat. He, after a
        few days, became loquaciously delirious during the chill and heat. He
        slept heavily during the perspiration. Added to all this was very
        pronounced <i><font color="#0000ff">jaundice</font></i>. The loquacity
        was so great that I could not help thinking of <i><font color="#0000ff">Stramonium</font></i>,
        and if it had been typhoid fever instead of intermittent fever would
        have given it. I went on the hunt for the remedy like a good little boy
        (I was a beginner then) and found in "H. C. Allen", on
        intermittent fever, that Pod. had this loquacious condition in
        black-faced type. I gave him the remedy, then, and he never had but one
        slight chill after. I gave it in the 12th potency. (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="CENTER">DIARRHŒA</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 90</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">April 23 (1884), about 9 A. M., diarrhœa set in. It
        had been threatening for an hour or two, and at last hurried me to
        stool. Stomach had been disturbed through the night from the juice of
        canned plums. Stool dark brown, mushy, copious, attended with much wind.
        One or two stools in the after part of the day. Took no medicine. In the
        following night about 3 A. M. driven out of bed suddenly. Stool watery,
        rather scanty, though gushing, as if abundant. Stools become frequent.
        Occasionally a slight pain in abdomen. Much rumbling and gurgling. No
        thirst, no nausea. As the trouble began with indigestion, and this was
        brought on by fruit, I acted on general principles, and took <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        200, one dose of a few pellets, half a dozen small, pin-head pellets.
        Waited four hours. Symptoms grew worse suddenly. Acting still upon
        general principles, took <i><font color="#0000ff">Nux vom</font></i>.
        200, one dose. Repeated in three hours. Grew steadily worse. Three to
        six stools every hour&nbsp;; dark green with yellow water&nbsp;;
        somewhat mushy, tenesmus&nbsp;; tendency to <i><font color="#0000ff">prolapsus
        ani</font></i>&nbsp;; pains more frequent, and threatening to become
        intense, and incisive and prolonged. Urine almost suppressed. Tongue
        moist, but beginning to put on a white coat and to be slimy. About noon
        of the 24th dissolved twelve small pellets of <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>
        200 in a glass of water. Of this solution took one teaspoonful. Within
        an hour symptoms became less urgent. By 6 P. M. they had nearly
        disappeared and this without repeating the dose.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> was indicated by the watery,
        mealy, dark-green stool, by the <i><font color="#0000ff">prolapsus ani</font></i>,
        by the morning aggravation, by the suppression of urine.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">April 28th, a good stool. April 29th, 5 P. M., diarrhœa
        began as before&nbsp;; renewed at 8 P. M. <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i>
        200, prepared as on the 24th. One teaspoonful sufficed. Up to this date,
        May 8th, no return of diarrhœa. (C. S. Jennings.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 91</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Master Bostwick, age 18 months, has been having
        diarrhœa for several weeks. It was attributed to the hot weather and
        some teething trouble. Notwithstanding various domestic remedies the
        child grew worse until I was called. I prescribed without avail several
        remedies, until the case became very serious. Symptoms&nbsp;: Stools
        thin, copious at first, then admixed with mucus, yellow and <i><font color="#0000ff">very
        offensive&nbsp;; worse in the morning and forenoon</font></i>. There was
        great prostration, and the surface and extremities together grew cold.
        Child <i><font color="#0000ff">perfectly unconscious, stupid, sleeping
        with half open eyes, rolling its head from side and moaning&nbsp;;
        constant gagging. Podophyllum</font></i> 1,000 (B. &amp; T.), in
        solution, a teaspoonful after every passage. Prompt improvement and
        perfect recovery followed. (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 92</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">A child, one year old but large for its age, with
        light complexion, black eyes and dark hair, had diarrhœa for two
        months. In the beginning of the sickness <i><font color="#0000ff">Cham</font></i>.
        was given on account of the great restlessness, with temporary benefit.
        A little later <i><font color="#0000ff">Calc. carb</font></i>. was given
        on account of the leucophlegmatic temperament, large head, light colored
        stools and crossness, but with no permanent relief. Then the child was
        taken to "Thousand Isles" in hopes of benefit from the
        climatic change, but the benefit was only temporary, and it was brought
        home as sick as ever and weaker. At this time the following symptoms
        were elicited&nbsp;: Light-colored, offensive diarrhœa, containing
        undigested matter&nbsp;; stools more frequent in the morning and
        forenoon. Great restlessness and prostration, has not slept more than
        half an hour at a time at night for weeks. Grinding the teeth (the few
        that are cut) and gums almost continually. Not much swelling of the
        gums, but don't want them touched. <i><font color="#0000ff">Appetite
        gone</font></i>. Gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum</font></i> c.
        m. (Fincke) in solution, a teaspoonful after each evacuations. Only two
        doses were necessary, after which the stools became natural,
        restlessness ceased, cheeks (before pale and sunken) flushed, appetite
        restored, sleeps good at night. Cured. (Nash).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">How any man laying claim to <i><font color="#0000ff">common
        honesty</font></i> can ignore or deny the evidence of the truth of homœopathy
        after the innumerable cures, both acute and chronic, of diarrhœa, by
        such remedies as <i><font color="#0000ff">Podophyllum, Aloes, Croton
        tiglium, Natrum sulphuricum</font></i>, etc., I cannot understand. It is
        pure pig-headedness, and if you ever tried to drive a hog where he did
        not want to go, you will have learned the meaning of that term.
        Reasoning is wasted on such.</p>
