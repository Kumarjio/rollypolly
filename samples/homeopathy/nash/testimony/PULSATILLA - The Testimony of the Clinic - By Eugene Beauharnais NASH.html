        <p align="JUSTIFY">I was called to see a man with rheumatism. He had
        been confined to his bed and arm chair for many months, and had suffered
        greatly from the disease and many doctors. Had not tried homœopathy,
        for there was "nothing in it." I found joints swollen (hands,
        feet, knees, body). The affection had continued all the time to move
        from joint to joint since he was attacked.<br>
        Heat did not &gt; but &lt;.<br>
        Tongue coated white, poor appetite, no thirst.<br>
        Very greatly discouraged, depressed.<br>
        Temperament, fair&nbsp;; mild disposition. There were other symptoms,
        but these were leading. He received <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        c. m. (Fincke). He improved promptly, but in a few days sent for me. He
        showed me a discharge from the urethra that looked gonorrhœal in
        character. That was in the days of long ago, when we did not know so
        much about bacteriology. He said that his wife had given it to him, for
        he had, as everybody knew, not been able to get away from home. The wife
        indignantly denied the imputation. Both looked to me for a solution of
        the mystery. I said to him - did you ever have clap before&nbsp;? He
        hesitated under the scrutiny of the flashing eyes of his wife. Then
        said&nbsp;: Yes, I did when I was a young man, before I was married. I
        said your rheumatism is improving since this discharge appeared. Yes.
        How were you cured of the clap&nbsp;? By an injection. Well, then, I
        said neither you nor your wife are guilty of inconstancy toward each
        other. This rheumatism from which you are now suffering is the result of
        that suppressed gonorrhœa of twenty years ago, and you will get well of
        both under the action of appropriate medication. But no more local
        injections, please. He recovered rapidly. I have seen other cases
        similar from such suppressions and am careful not to resort to them. I
        did not know of the history of gonorrhœa in the case, but treated it on
        the symptomatic indications. (Nash.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY"><img height="284" alt="Dr Frederick H. LUTZE (1838-1924)" src="./PULSATILLA - The Testimony of the Clinic - By Eugene Beauharnais NASH_files/lutzef01.jpg" width="211" border="0" align="right" hspace="5">Mrs.
        G., age 35, a farmer's wife, called to get some medicine for neuralgia,
        stating that the whole right side of the head was involved. The pains
        would come and go gradually at very irregular periods, shoot into the
        ear along the side of the neck and under the eye, and were always made
        worse by putting anything cold in the mouth. To the question if the pain
        was relieved by putting anything warm in the mouth, she answered&nbsp;:
        "Oh, no&nbsp;; that makes it a great deal worse." The pains,
        although mostly confined to the right side of the face, were moving
        about frequently, often after leaving the head appearing in the left leg
        or heel&nbsp;; she was always chilly, easily moved to tears, and felt
        decidedly better in the open air. I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        30, two powders, to dissolve one in four teaspoonfuls of water, and take
        one every two hours. The neuralgia was cured with the first powder and
        remained so&nbsp;; she had no need of the second. (F. H. Lutze.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mr. M., aged 35, dark skin, black hair, bilious
        temperament. Had an attack of la grippe, followed by what his physicians
        (of whom he had five, four allopaths and one eclectic) called
        cerebro-spinal meningitis, with its complications. For six weeks they
        had been bombarding the enemy without relief. He told me his drug bill
        aside from his doctors' bill was $35. By some mysterious Providence he
        was moved to call me.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">SYMPTOMS. Pain in the base of the brain continuous,
        but much worse <i><font color="#0000ff">every evening</font></i>, so
        that convulsions and insensibility were the result occasionally. The
        only relief was from <i><font color="#0000ff">tight bandaging</font></i>
        and <i><font color="#0000ff">cold applications</font></i>. He would cry
        and could not help it when the pains were greatest. Diagnosis,
        neuralgia&nbsp;; prescription, <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        200, three doses, three hours apart&nbsp;; relieved him in twenty-four
        hours, and he made a good recovery without any more medicine. (J.
        Emmons.)<br>
        This case shows that if the <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i>
        are there the temperament of the patient will not interfere with the
        action of the indicated remedy. Yet it must be remembered that such
        indications are much more apt to occur in the <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        temperament. (N.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 29</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I was called to a case at 1 o'clock in the morning.
        Had just come in from a hard day's work, and refused to go until I got
        some rest. Father, who came after me, said that his boy, about 14 years
        of age, had rheumatism terribly bad&nbsp;; had not been able to sleep
        for the great pain for many nights. I sent some <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        to take until I came in the morning. Next morning met de father on the
        way again after me. Boy had not slept at all, and was in great pain. I
        found the pain, swelling and suffering in the right hip. It had
        travelled there from the feet, where it had moved to the knees, then the
        hip. Now the parts first attacked were free from pain or swelling.
        Covering or warm applications did not relieve, and he was crying with
        the pain. A year before he had had a six weeks' run of the same disease
        under regular treatment&nbsp;; had discharged his doctor and cured (?)
        himself with "Angel's rheumatic gun," a well advertised patent
        medicine. But that gun didn't hit the mark. Now, after having tried it
        for a week, <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i> 4th was
        prescribed in solution, a teaspoonful once in 2 hours, until relieved,
        and I passed on to see other patients, promising to call on my return.
        Three hours after, as I drew up in front of the house, I found the
        grandfather walking back and forth in the front yard in a brown study.
        Did you give that boy morphine&nbsp;? said he, with blood in his eye.
        No, I answered. Why&nbsp;? He went to sleep in half an hour after the
        first dose and has not awakened yet. This was true, and in three days he
        was around and went on to a rapid and perfect cure. (Nash.)<br>
        I could fill this book with cases cured with this remedy, but
        "enough is as good as a feast."<br>
        I want here to call attention to the fact that this remedy of wide range
        is not one that is chosen from its positive power to cause pathological
        lesions, and yet if you look over either "Clark's Dictionary"
        or "Hering's Guiding Symptoms" under the head of clinics you
        would think that there was no disease to which flesh was heir where it
        might not be useful. Now when we refer to our resume of seven
        leaders&nbsp;:<br>
        1. Mild, gentle, yielding disposition, sad and despondent, weeps easily,
        sandy hair, blue eyes, pale face, muscles soft and flabby.<br>
        2. <i><font color="#0000ff">Changeable</font></i> remedy, pains and
        swelling travel from joint to joint. Hæmorrhages flow and stop, then
        flow again&nbsp;; no two stools, no two chills alike, etc.<br>
        3. Bad taste in the mouth, &lt; morning, with great dryness, but no
        thirst.<br>
        4. Stomach easily disturbed, especially by cakes, pastry or rich, fat
        food.<br>
        5. Thick bland discharges from all mucous membranes.<br>
        6. Catamenia too late, scanty or suppressed, particularly by wetting the
        feet.<br>
        7. <i><font color="#0000ff">Modalities</font></i>, &lt; in warm room,
        warm applications, abuse of iron, chilliness with the pains. &gt; by
        cool open air, walking slowly around&nbsp;; cold food or drink. Tying up
        tightly relieves the headache. I say when we refer to these it is hard
        to understand why this remedy should be so widely useful except from a
        homœopathic standpoint. And so we come again to the inevitable
        conclusion as Chas. S. Raue used to say&nbsp;: "The symptoms
        indicating the remedy may lie outside the symptoms which go to make the
        pathology of the case." It is well for us not to lose sight of this
        great cardinal truth. It must be so else routinism would be the result.
        So long as disease attacks different individuals of different
        temperaments and different degrees of susceptibility and resistance, and
        especially with different complications, such as psora, syphilis and
        sycosis, so long must individualism as to choice of remedy be necessary.
        Homœopathy is wide enough in its scope to cover all these possible
        conditions, and it cannot be squeezed into any pathological livery. This
        is the great advantage of our system over that of the old school. With
        them it is name the disease first, then prescribe, and often they cannot
        name it at all, what then&nbsp;? Of course, do something or fire in the
        dark. With us if the symptoms of the patient, pathological or
        symptomalogical, one or both, correspond in its symptoms to the remedy,
        we are ready to act and to good purpose, too. Similia similibus curantur
        can never be wiped out. (N.)</p>
