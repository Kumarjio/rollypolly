        toe nails and ulcers about the nails are often most troublesome
        affections, and the more we confine ourselves to the treatment of these
        apparently local troubles the worse off we shall be as well as the
        patient. A few months since I saw a case of this kind in company with
        another physician. The treatment had been localized, and such remedies
        as <i><font color="#0000ff">Arn., Merc., Hepar., Nit. ac</font></i>.,
        had been given. It now turned out that she was full of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus
        tox</font></i>. symptoms. Restless nights&nbsp;; was compelled to change
        her position frequently, and always with relief&nbsp;; was stiff in
        joints and muscles on first motion, better after moving for a
        while&nbsp;; loss of appetite, etc. <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>.
        in a high potency gave her good night's rest&nbsp;; stiffness of joints
        and limbs left her&nbsp;; her appetite returned&nbsp;; the ulcer and
        apparent ingrowing toe nail got perfectly well a few weeks later without
        any tropical applications. (H. N. Guernsey.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 84</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">I was called in consultation to an obstinate case of
        intermittent fever. It was a case imported from a district in the west
        where malaria abounds. It had been of years' standing, having been cured
        (?) several times by the inevitable <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>
        on account of the <i><font color="#0000ff">plasmodium malaria</font></i>.
        But of late she had been unable to take <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>.
        It made her sicker than the disease. I had suggested <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipec</font></i>.
        and again one or two other remedies on the statement of the physician in
        charge, and because she had been so abused with <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>,
        but still the case went on and grew worse until the doctor insisted on
        my coming to see her. When arrived at the house where the patient was
        she was just coming out of a very severe chill. She was <i><font color="#0000ff">tossing
        from side to side, with moaning, low delirium with muttering</font></i>.
        I managed to get a look at her tongue, it was red and dry, in a <i><font color="#0000ff">triangular
        red tip pointing backward</font></i>. Just then she gave a hard dry
        cough. What about the cough&nbsp;? said I. Well, said one of the lady
        bystanders, that cough is very peculiar. She only coughed during the
        chill. Probably she won't cough again now until the next chill. There
        were other symptoms, of course, which I will not narrate here, because
        we have enough to prescribe on without fear of failure. Every homœopath
        knows what it is. <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>. 200 was
        given. She never had another chill. The doctor was a good prescriber,
        but he had not seen the case right in the paroxysm, and he was a young
        practitioner and had never heart of Carroll Dunham's cough symptom.

        <p align="JUSTIFY">A man sprained his leg in a harvest field. When he
        presented himself to me he had exhausted the old school remedies. Found
        a swelling about the size of half an ordinary orange just below the
        knee-cap at the head of the tibia. Was very lame, worse during rest, at
        night, before a storm, etc., a complete <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>
        case.<br>
        Prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i> 30. In five days he
        reported no swelling and no pain to speak of. He got but one
        prescription. He sent another man who had been hurt in the same
        field&nbsp;; he had sprained his ankle. The symptoms in this case were
        precisely the same as in the other&nbsp;; it was, however, of more
        recent occurrence, and was located at the ankle instead of at the
        knee&nbsp;; but still a clear <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>
        case. I gave him the same as I gave the other, with the assurance to the
        patient that it would cure him in a week. He came to me again not
        better. I was so sure of the remedy that I gave him the 3d of the same.
        He reported in a week that the medicine acted like a charm. (W. J.
        Hawkes.)</p>

        exposure to cold, accompanied by paralysis of the right side from which
        he slowly recovered. No symptoms of rheumatism until twelve years
        ago&nbsp;; since then pains almost constantly in the right side&nbsp;;
        decidedly rheumatic in character with marked periodicity, coming on at
        10 P. M. and lasting till 6 A. M., worse in winter and before a

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. Duane Fuller, age about 65, was taken with
        severe chill, which was soon followed <i><font color="#0000ff">by aching
        pains all over, wrist, in back and head</font></i>. She soon lost <i><font color="#0000ff">consciousness,
        went into a stupor with low grade delirium muttering and continually
        tossing from side to side in the bed. The tongue began to grow dry and
        stiff so that her muttering grew unintelligible</font></i>. There was an
        epidemic of typhoid fever in the vicinity, some had died under old
        school treatment&nbsp;; so I first prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Baptisia</font></i>
        with confidence that it would so modify the case that its subsequent
        treatment would be easy or abort it entirely, as I had done in a number
        cases before. But it failed. The next day there was no improvement, and
        I, thinking that psora might be standing in the way, dropped in a dose
        of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> 200. Then erysipelas of
        the head and face, the most intense I ever saw, developed. Perhaps the <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        brought it out, but there was no amelioration of the other symptoms.<br>
        The head and face were so swollen that the eyes were completely closed,
        and the size of the head it seemed to me was nearly one-third increased.
        The eruption was decidedly <i><font color="#0000ff">vesicular</font></i>.
        Now the remedy was pain. <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus tox</font></i>.
        m. m. was given in solution. The restlessness immediately began to
        subside, the muttering less, and an easy sleep (though she remained
        unconscious) followed in which she remained for several days and nights.
        The swelling gradually subsided, the vesicles dried and scaled off, and
        when she awoke her mind was clear. In nine days sat up in bed and took
        nourishment, and made rapid and complete recovery. (Nash).<br>
        I have seen this remedy in the same potency (made on my own fluxion
        potentizer) do likewise since in other cases. These cases of <i><font color="#0000ff">Rhus</font></i>
        need no comment. No remedy is more clear-cut in its indications and none
        more satisfactory in application to the cure of the sick when indicated.
