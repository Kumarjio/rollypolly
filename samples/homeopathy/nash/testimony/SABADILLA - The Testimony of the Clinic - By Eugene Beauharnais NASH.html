        Miss E., aged 23, book-keeper, rather tall, thin, but counting herself
        in good health, complained of a single annoying symptom of long
        standing, as follows&nbsp;:</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Since fourteenth year of age had suffered from
        attacks of sneezing and lachrymation. The slightest change in
        temperature, the most trivial irritation, would bring on violent
        paroxysms of sneezing, lachrymation and watery coryza going from one
        room to another, a draft, the opening of a door, the chilling of the
        hands or a bright light striking the eyes were any of them sufficient to
        precipitate an attack, and when such exciting causes appeared to be
        lacking occasional attacks would come on anyhow. There was no organic
        catarrh, no discharge (except at the time of the paroxysms), no symptoms
        of any kind left afterwards. No headache, no menstrual trouble, no
        pains, no aching, no modalities except as above mentioned in regard to
        the sneezing, <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i> 200, a few
        powders, cured completely and permanently.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- This case was absolutely hopeless for a
        pathological prescriber or for an allopath. The pathology is not
        mysterious, almost anyone, if the knew enough, could talk learnedly
        about it. I would be a description of how puerperal irritation,
        inconceivably slight, affected by branches of the sympathetic nerve and
        carried by paths and routes absolutely unknown to the mucous membrane of
        the nose, produced an undue afflux of blood, tumefaction and irritation
        of the Schneiderian membrane until another reflex was thereby started,
        setting up the whole complex mechanism of stimulation, there occurred a
        powerful, sudden contraction of the diaphragm, producing a friable
        expulsion of air through the nasal passages, accompanied by such a
        stimulation of the lachrymal apparatus as to produce copious tears, and
        also by such an activity of the nasal mucous membrane as to cause a
        profuse flow of watery secretion from the nose to the great detriment of
        many fine linen handkerchiefs. What is all this but words, vain
        words&nbsp;? Miss Eberle could go through the process forty times while
        the pathologist was describing one sneeze. How could the most profound
        understanding of the pathological process show that <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>
        was the remedy&nbsp;? I leave that problem to the prayerful attention of
        the devotees of pathology, Epsom salts, castor oil and calomel. As to
        the remedy, sneezing, lachrymation and thin nasal discharge are
        characteristic. I count it a fault in our materia medica that it does
        not dwell with sufficient emphasis upon this important feature of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>.
        This drug in the days when the allopaths used Galenical medicines rather
        than coal tar products was of considerable prominence as an
        antiparasitic and vermifuge. Like nearly all the drugs of the old
        school, more than a year old, it has fallen into disuse, but was
        retained in the last pharmacopœia for the purpose of manufacturing the
        alkaloid veratrine of which it is the source. The present pharmacopœia
        drops it entirely, retaining its alkaloid only. I know by experience
        that it is impossible to powder <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>
        seeds without taking precaution against the inhaling of the dust, as it
        is provocative of most powerful stimulation&nbsp;; the alkaloid has the
        same property but in a milder degree.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">It is said that the celebrated Schneeberger
        Schnupf-Taback owes its property of causing powerful nasal titillation
        to the presence of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i> in its
        composition.</p>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">
        </font></i><p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i> is almost a polychrest, and
        indicated probably twenty times where it is once used. I have no doubt
        that <i><font color="#0000ff">Ipecac., Pulsatilla</font></i> and <i><font color="#0000ff">Lachesis</font></i>
        are frequently useful to zig zag a case to health when <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>
        would do more powerful and direct work than any of those mentioned. The
        resemblances and differences between it and Lachesis are worthy of
        careful study.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">In the Materia Medica we find the following symptoms,
        showing its power in the direction of Miss E's symptoms&nbsp;:
        "Lachrymation, worse when walking in the open air or looking at
        light&nbsp;; sneezing, coughing or yawning, lachrymation as soon as the
        least pain is felt in some other part of the body, for instance, the
        hand."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Margins of the lids red."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Spasmodic sneezing&nbsp;; fluent coryza."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Either nostril stuffed up&nbsp;; itching
        nose."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Violent sneezing from time to time, shaking the
        abdomen, followed by lachrymation."</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">"Coryza with savage frontal pains and redness of
        eyelids&nbsp;; violent spasmodic sneezing, influenza and lachrymation on
        going into the open air. Cough with lachrymation." (J. B. S. King.)</p>

        <b><font color="#000080">
        <p align="CENTER">PLASMODIUM MALARIA</p>
        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#000080">Case 98</font></b><br>
        Well nourished woman, strong of about twenty-eight years of age, of dark
        hair, eyes and skin, who was in her second labor. She is the possessor
        of a fine mind and a charming disposition, consequently had the ability
        to keep herself calm during the trying ordeal of hard labour. The
        following conditions were present&nbsp;: Cervix three-quarters dilated,
        a ruptured sack, a right brow, which, later, was reduced to a face
        presentation. The labor had been on for several hours, the pains were
        hard and tedious, keeping up uninterruptedly without apparent progress
        being made, terminating in about five hours after seeing her.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Soon after the second stage of labor had been
        completed the patient complained of coldness all over body, which
        shortly after eventuated in a terrific chill.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The air was hot and sultry that July night. The heat
        of the room, the hardness of the birth, the copious sweating, the draft
        of air passing on patient covered with a moist sheet, which was so from
        perspiration, the subsidence of mental tension, all, as I thought, had
        much to do with inducing that chill. <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        was given with apparent good results. The third stage of labor having
        been completed, no further attention being required from myself, the
        patient was assigned to the care of nurse, who called me in about one
        hour after leaving the lying-in room to inform me that patient had a
        temperature of 105°F and much mental excitement. I sought the bedside
        of the afflicted one and questioned her as to her feelings, thereby
        hoping to find an appropriate remedy covering this extraordinary
        phenomenon coming on so soon after the termination of labor. Patient
        complained of frontal and occipital headache, with vertigo like floating
        away, chilly feeling in the back moving upwards, numbness and trembling
        of body and extremities, no thirst, a moist, hot skin, a rapid, bounding
        pulse, slow action of mind, and a labored use of tongue, for which group
        of symptoms <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i> was suggested
        to mind, but not given, trusting that <i><font color="#0000ff">Aconite</font></i>
        would relieve the patient temporarily, at least. There had been no
        perverted feelings noticed just before labor began nor during the
        previous weeks leading to clue as to this manifestation of disease.
        Before leaving patient that morning she expressed herself as improving.
        The day passed with no new developments. <i><font color="#0000ff">Gelsemium</font></i>
        was left to be given later if necessary. The following morning at about
        the time the previous chill came on a slight chill occurred, a fever
        developed and continued until latter part of forenoon, when I saw her.
        The situation had changed from day before in that there were tenderness
        and pain in abdomen on pressure, some tympanites and an arrest of usual
        local discharge. I now thought it wise to make an examination of uterus,
        and after which a curettement was decided upon and made revealing no
        indications of there having been an infection induced through the birth
        track to show cause of disease.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The third morning following birth there was another
        terrific chill and fever, the latter lasting the greater part of
        forenoon, some tenderness and pain with tympanites continuing. The
        fourth morning was practically a repetition of the third. With this
        addition, the disease had now made a change in patient's appearance,
        which was noticeable in the color of skin and marked prostration. I
        realized that I had a hard problem to solve in curing the sufferer of a
        depressing illness, and that something must be done as soon as possible
        to check its progress.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The family became anxious about prognosis and sought
        speedy relief for the afflicted one. An obstetrician of experience was
        asked for by husband and relatives, to which request I yielded. Medical
        literature has on record cases of inactive pelvic abscesses resulting
        from previous infection, specific and otherwise, which remain dormant
        until aroused by the bruising incident to labor, some becoming active
        immediately and others following within three days to some weeks after
        labor. In this particular case I had no definite knowledge precluding
        any previous infection resulting in a latent abscess, therefore held to
        the theory that an abscess might be the cause of trouble, being partly
        confirmed in the idea by the course of treatment pursued, although her
        health had been good during gestation.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Infection can be conveyed to patient by attendant, a
        common source of such unhappy occurrence. It may happen through
        meddlesome interference from one having no business to interfere&nbsp;;
        I had had one such in a nurse marking repeated vaginal examinations at
        the request of patient, and without my knowledge till after an infection
        had taken place. As to my having been the cause that might be a
        possibility, and yet I had not been exposed to an infection of any kind
        during the previous several weeks, neither in private nor in hospital
        practice. It has been my habit to carry out strict aseptic precautions
        in personal cleanliness, no digital examinations of birth-tract being
        made till after thoroughly scrubbing arms, hands, fingers, and
        especially finger-nails to avoid a possible chance of carrying
        infection.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">My desire was to make another thorough physical and
        uterine examination, including curettements, as well as one of the blood
        before counsel came in to see patient. The former was made immediately,
        but there was nothing found worth mentioning in addition to facts known.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The fact that I had had experience in examining blood
        to determine doubtful conditions of similar character led me to do so in
        this case&nbsp;; that it would confirm the diagnosis only is to be
        admitted&nbsp;; but what relief to the mind to even have that
        consolation in a case of this kind of complication. This I did, and to
        my satisfaction there were found plasmodium malaria in profusion and in
        several stages of development, clearly demonstrating the disease to be
        one of malaria and not one of infection following labor. I was satisfied
        now that more study given toward finding the indicated remedy and its
        application would successfully cure the patient and restore hope in the
        minds of all concerned.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The common way of handling a case of this sort is by
        large doses of <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i>, and the
        majority of medical men would have selected and given this drug for
        treatment irrespective of consequences. Is it not far better to actually
        cure disease rather than to suppress it&nbsp;?</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Why engorge liver, spleen and blood with a drug which
        takes a long time to eradicate itself from the system&nbsp;? There are
        instances, and they are not rare, where that drug never can be
        eradicated from the body, but remains in the form of quinine cachexia.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Why not accept and apply Hahnemann's teachings as the
        standard in therapeutics, where life and health, in the present and
        future, are at stake&nbsp;? He declares that "the highest aim of
        healing is the speedy and permanent restitution of health or gentle
        alleviation and obliteration of disease in its entire extent, in the
        shortest, most reliable and safest manner, according to clearly
        intelligible reasons." The image of the disease having been
        obtained in the following prominent and characteristic symptoms, the
        prescription which cured the patient was based upon it.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chill beginning about 2 A. M. each night, being
        regular as to time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chill beginning in lower extremity and going upwards.
        Chill lasting a long time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Chill being hard and producing terrors in mind of
        patient. Fever lasting a long time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Sweats profusely all over and lasting a long time.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Thirst little or none, during chill, fever and sweat.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">After comparison with a few remedies choice was made
        of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>, which was given, and
        promptly cleared case of all pathological symptoms.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">There was not even the slightest return of any of
        them in the following morning nor since, patient making a good recovery
        on this one remedy alone. My consultant pronounced the disease pyæmia.
        I asked him on what he based his diagnosis, and he replied upon the
        history of the case and the tympanites. I called his attention to the
        examination made of blood and finding <i><font color="#0000ff">plasmodia</font></i>
        in it, proving illness to be malaria, to which he would not listen. My
        reason for following course as stated was a desire to do rather than not
        to do what would aid me in getting at etiology of disease. I am well
        aware that the procedure followed was not in accordance with the
        teachings of Hahnemannian homœopathy. (I think it was, Nash). I am
        equally aware that the findings in uterine and blood examination would
        not aid me one iota in making a homœopathic prescription (right, Nash),
        but I had in my favor an unquestioned right, and besides felt it my duty
        to use methods of accuracy concerning diagnosis made, when same was not
        harmful to patient, and not interfering with treatment&nbsp;; besides by
        so doing the good will and future patronage of family and friends were
        retained, which was worthy of consideration. (Right again, Nash).</p>
        <p align="CENTER">* * * *</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Examination of the blood by microscope demonstrated
        what the disturbing element was due to, and had it been made the first
        day of pathological manifestation the useless examination of uterus and
        curettement would not have been made later&nbsp;; they were uncalled for
        and should not have been made. (E. E. Reininger).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">This is a remarkably well reported case, though long,
        and we have not copied all the remarks of the doctor in defense of his
        procedure, which we think needs no defense after all, but would like to
        call attention of our readers to a few points. I said in part in my
        discussion of this paper&nbsp;: I noticed that when the doctor had
        discovered the plasmodium and thus convinced himself that it was
        malaria, he sat down and studied the remedy that covered the <i><font color="#0000ff">symptoms</font></i>,
        and cured in the <i><font color="#0000ff">old way</font></i> after all.
        Why did he not do that before the plasmodium was discovered&nbsp;? Both
        the paper and Dr. King (who cured a similar case) acknowledged that the
        plasmodium did not help them to discover the remedy. I have no fault to
        find with scientific means of diagnosis, and believe that it is our duty
        to know everything possible about our cases, for purposes of diagnosis,
        prognosis, hygienic management, etc., but these things, valuable as they
        are, must not be permitted to encroach upon the field of the symptomatic
        selection of the remedy. The latter often lie outside of the symptoms
        upon which the diagnosis is found. The minute symptoms that are
        apparently trivial, that escape the attention of the diagnostician, are
        often the important ones for the selection of the remedy. (N.).</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The first mistake in this case was the not covering
        the case in its <i><font color="#0000ff">symptomatology</font></i>. And
        who does not make them&nbsp;? Fools make no mistakes, but wise men do,
        and I prefer to be ranked with the latter class, with Dr. Reininger.
        Blood, urine, fæcal, sputum examinations are all right, and neither
        Hahnemann nor his followers ever ignored them so far as they were able
        to understand them. All must come in so far as possible for a full
        understanding of a case, but for purposes of prescribing symptomatology
        leads. (N.)</p>

        </font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><b><font color="#000080">Case 99</font></b><br>
        Patient confined to bed for more than three months&nbsp;;, one week of
        that time he had been attended by a physician outside of the hospital
        (Cook County Hospital, Chicago), who prescribed large and frequent doses
        of <i><font color="#0000ff">Quinine</font></i> without improvement. He
        had been in the hospital over two months before I prescribed for him,
        having been under the influence of drugs all of that time, so that I
        could not clearly tell drug symptoms from disease symptoms when I saw
        him for the first time. All drugs were discontinued and placebo given
        for one week, during which time I visited the patient's bedside, taking
        notes and studying his condition from ten to fifteen minutes each day.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The following group of symptoms was obtained, clearly
        defining the individuality of the disease, upon which was based the
        prescription that successfully cleared the man of all pathological
        manifestations&nbsp;:<br>
        1. Chill always began in feet and moved upwards&nbsp;; when chilly
        feeling reached the spine a violent shaking of the whole body began.<br>
        2. Chill came on with regularity as to time, twice in twenty-four hours.<br>
        3. Heat and fever showed its greatest intensity in head and face.<br>
        4. Sweat was profuse, continuing throughout afternoon and night,
        requiring the bedding to be changed two and three times in twenty-four
        hours.<br>
        5. Thirst, very little during chill, fever or sweat. In accordance with
        this combination, condition and symptoms <i><font color="#0000ff">Sabadilla</font></i>
        was selected.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">The first day after the remedy had been given the
        chill was more moderate than usual, and patient declared that he felt
        much better. On the second day after the chill was milder still. The
        third day chill was still less, and on fourth day there was no chill at
        all. From this day there were no more chills, and the patient made a
        rapid recovery. After two weeks the patient became a ward man, assisting
        nurses about ward, in which capacity he rendered faithful labor for over
        three months, ever feeling grateful for his recovery&nbsp;; he was
        discharged at the end of that time at his own request.</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Patient received no more medicine after that one
        prescription made by myself during his stay at the hospital as ward man.
        Nineteen different drugs were given to him in the hospital prior to that
        prescription without effecting a cure. The history sheets submitted give
        record in detail. (Reininger).</p>
