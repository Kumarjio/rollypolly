        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 14</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Emma G., aged about 30 years. Has been an invalid for
        years, under the care of an allopathic gynæcologist, who treated her
        for ulceration of the cervix. He had succeeded in healing the ulcers by
        local cauterizations, etc., but the canal had become so narrow that for
        a year he had been obliged to introduce a catheter to draw off the
        menstrual fluid. Finally it became so closed that the could not
        introduce the instrument at all. Then the patient passed another year
        having great pain and fullness in the uterine region at every period,
        which confined her to the bed for days, but no appearance of the menses.
        I was called to the case and prescribed <i><font color="#0000ff">Pulsatilla</font></i>
        routinely. Visited her when she was due the next month. Found her
        suffering as usual, and no relief in any way from the remedy.<br>
        Then I sat down and wrote out her case <i><font color="#0000ff">in toto</font></i>.<br>
        I found a history decidedly scrofulous or psoric, and among a quite long
        list of symptoms the following&nbsp;:<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Frequent flashes of heat all over the body
        followed by sweat and debility</font></i>.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Much burning of the feet</font></i>, has to put
        them out of bed.<br>
        <i><font color="#0000ff">Weak, faint spells, especially in the forenoon</font></i>.<br>
        These with the psoric history decided the prescription.<br>
        I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i> c. m. (Fincke), a
        powder, dry on the tongue, once a week (<i><font color="#0000ff">Sac.
        lac</font></i>. in solution between), with a promise that I would come
        up the next time when she was due, and if she was no better would make
        an examination. So when the time came I took my wife and went up
        prepared to do so.<br>
        Found the patient instead of upstairs in her bed as usual down in the
        parlor entertaining some lady friends who were calling.<br>
        She came out where we were, and I said, How about that
        examination&nbsp;? Oh, said she, I am so glad it is not necessary. I am
        menstruating perfectly easy, and feel so well. She never failed
        afterward to menstruate regularly, and was restored to perfect health.
        (Nash.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- It will be observed that the symptoms
        leading to this wonderful cure were not local but general, thus
        verifying the truth of what Charles G. Raue used to say&nbsp;:
        "That the symptoms leading to the choice of the remedy sometimes
        lie entirely outside of those which go to make the pathology of the
        case.<br>
        Gonorrhœal strictures have been cured the same way where the general
        symptoms correspond with the remedy. (N.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">I., aged 12 months, had had diarrhœa for nearly a
        month. Her flesh was soft and flabby&nbsp;; <i><font color="#0000ff">open
        fontanelles</font></i>&nbsp;; tongue coated white at the back. She was <i><font color="#0000ff">thirsty</font></i>
        and drank a good deal of milk and water. The diarrhœa was <i><font color="#0000ff">worse
        in the morning</font></i>, beginning <i><font color="#0000ff">about</font></i>
        4 A. M., continuing more or less until the afternoon. It was dark
        yellow, watery, occasionally <i><font color="#0000ff">greenish white
        mucus, coming with a gush early in the morning</font></i>, almost
        involuntarily during the day when standing. Child cried a little before
        bowels were moved. There was also a cough, worse on lying down at night,
        sometimes causing her to vomit&nbsp;; <i><font color="#0000ff">child
        slept with eyes only half closed</font></i>.<br>
        The patient's <i><font color="#0000ff">appearance</font></i> suggested <i><font color="#0000ff">Calc.

        <p align="CENTER">METRORRHAGIA</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 19</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Was called to visit Mrs. -----, æt. fifty-two, June
        6, 1879. Found she had been suffering from metrorrhagia, constipation
        and concomitants for about ten years. She stated that her medical
        adviser had always been an allopath. He who last attended her, after a
        protracted and unsuccessful trial of his individual skill, had
        accompanied her to New York to consult a now emeritus professor of
        surgery of an allopathic medical college, who had made for himself an
        enviable reputation as an operating surgeon. The emeritus professor,
        after obtaining a history of the case and making his examinations,
        endeavored to console the lady by informing her that <i><font color="#0000ff">his</font></i>
        wife was in about the same condition as herself&nbsp;; that he sent her
        to this retreat and that watering place, all of which resulted in little
        if any benefit&nbsp;; and intimated that she might, if she thought well
        of it, do the same.<br>
        She concluded not to think well of it, and so returned as she went, like
        the door upon its hinges, unprofited.<br>
        Her physician, after an attendance of several years, during which his
        patient became gradually worse, abandoned the case. She had the
        assurance, however, to inform me that if he had only persevered in his
        attendance she supposed he would have relieved her.<br>
        She gave me to understand, moreover, that it was at the instance of some
        of her friends that I had been called, and not because she had any
        confidence in Homœopathy.<br>
        Her metrorrhagia, which had been exceedingly prostrating and annoying in
        many ways from its incipiency, had continued constantly for the last six
        months with the exception of two weeks, and was of a passive or active
        character, accompanied by very little pain.<br>
        At time it consisted of a slight oozing, the discharge presenting a dark
        appearance&nbsp;; at others it passed in considerable gushes, and was a
        bright red color, with very few clots.<br>
        To procure alvine evacuations, it was her custom to resort to enemata or
        cathartics. She complained bitterly of painful hæmorrhoids. Her general
        appearance was bloated, and her extremities œdematous. She had an
        annoying bearing down sensation, especially <i><font color="#0000ff">when
        on the feet</font></i>, so that she moved about with difficulty. She had
        occasional stitches from right to left, across the epigastrium, and was
        quite sensitive to a jolt or jar.<br>
        The symptoms which led to the selection of the <i><font color="#0000ff">similimum</font></i>
        were the following&nbsp;: <i><font color="#0000ff">Frequent hot flushes
        to the face&nbsp;; feet habitually cold or burning soles</font></i>.
        (Feet so cold she must sit with them in the oven of the kitchen stove,
        or soles so hot at night that she must put them from under the bedcovers
        to cool them). <i><font color="#0000ff">Heat in the vertex. An empty,
        faint sensation at the epigastrium about</font></i> 11 A. M., <i><font color="#0000ff">rendering
        it necessary to partake of some food. Unable to lie on the left side or
        back&nbsp;; must lie on the right side</font></i>. (Lying on the left
        side was followed by intolerable unrest, on the back by nightmare). <i><font color="#0000ff">Drinks
        much, eats little</font></i>.<br>
        During treatment the importance of keeping quiet was not enjoined upon
        the patient, but she was allowed to exert herself in any way she deemed
        proper, nor was she restricted in the least in regard to her diet.<br>
        A few pellets of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulph</font></i>. m. m. were
        given her dry on the tongue, June 6, 1876, and the dose was not repeated
        nor any other remedy given for four months. As she had been subjected
        for many years to allopathic dosing, she was provided with the usual
        placebo, with direction to take three pellets at night if she felt that
        she needed them. She was also directed to call me at any time if
        warranted by any change in her symptoms. On the 6th of October, 1876,
        being in the immediate vicinity of her residence, I called on my patient
        to ascertain particulars, having heard, incidentally only, that she was
        better. She soon presented herself, exhibiting an appearance very
        different from that of four months previously. Her first exclamation
        was, "Under God I am indebted to you for my restoration to
        health." She further stated, "A week after commencing the
        medicine the hæmorrhage ceased, and has not returned. At the time the
        hæmorrhage disappeared my bowels became regular in their evacuations,
        and have remained so. My painful hæmorrhoids have ceased to exist. At
        my monthly periods I menstruate normally for two or three days." I
        inquired, "What about your other symptoms&nbsp;?" She replied,
        "Oh, the hot flushes to my face, my cold feet or burning soles, the
        all-gone feeling at the stomach about 11 o'clock A. M., the inability to
        lie on the left side or back, the disposition to drink frequently and
        largely, and not being able to eat much have all disappeared, and I
        really feel as if I could not be sufficiently grateful." (L.
        Shafer, M. D.)</p>

        <p align="JUSTIFY">Case 20</p>
        </font></b>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">Mrs. S-----, a married woman of fifty years of age,
        of light complexion, blue eyes, auburn hair. A nervous sort of body,
        complained for nearly six months as follows&nbsp;:<br>
        Frequent micturition day and night. Urine passed in small quantities -
        about a large spoonful at once - with urgency before, pain, smarting,
        burning, scalding, after each passage. There was a sensation of pressure
        upon the bladder also. The above were all the symptoms she gave, all I
        could get, at the time.<br>
        The above condition was distressing and kept her from church and social
        gathering. Without any comparison of remedies, for such condition, I
        gave <i><font color="#0000ff">Cantharis</font></i> 200, which gave some
        relief, but only that. At the third call, I questioned her more closely
        and found she had, in addition to the foregoing symptoms, the following.
        Had much prurigo of labia, groins, upper part of thighs&nbsp;: the
        itching being so intense she wore out her clothing rubbing and
        scratching the parts.<br>
        The labia vestibulum, meatus urinarius and otium vaginæ, together with
        the adjacent skin, were inflamed and the labia majora dry and cracked.
        All these areas were subject to attacks of intense itching, burning and
        smarting upon scratching, daily. <i><font color="#0000ff">She was
        subject to frequent flushes of heat with redness of face, followed by
        slight perspiration. Got chilly easily and warm as easily. Heat and work
        aggravated her symptoms. Had considerable thirst&nbsp;; and less hunger.
        Often had burning of feet, both day and night&nbsp;; worse nights</font></i>.<br>
        She had used all sorts of medicines, salves and ointments, hot and cold
        water, but only to repel the local irritation from time to time. This is
        what had been done, just prior to the time she first called on me, and
        this accounted for the paucity of symptoms given at first and second
        call. On the basis of the last symptoms, I gave her <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        500, three doses, and a subsequent prescription of <i><font color="#0000ff">Sac.
        lac</font></i>. At the end of a week she was materially better, and from
        that time to this she had no more trouble. The <i><font color="#0000ff">Sulphur</font></i>
        was given Feb. 22, 1890. (Stow.)</p>
        <p align="JUSTIFY">REMARKS.- Here are six cases, illustrating the
        curative action of this great polychrest and antipsoric. A large book
        might be written in the same way, with a hundred able and scientific
        physicians adding corroborative testimony. We cannot give the time and
        space, but will refer the reader to my monograph on "Sulphur and
        Comparisons," where I have endeavored to give a more full account
        of the remedy. (It is published by Boericke &amp; Tafel.)</p>
